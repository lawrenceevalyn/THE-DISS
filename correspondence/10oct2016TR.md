Terry,

Thank you for meeting with me last week -- I have a note to follow up with you to request the papers you mentioned on "intergenre and mixing genre (dramatic novel)" which I think refers to a play which described itself as a novel, and perhaps to an article on intergenre connections.

I've been starting and abandoning thesis proposal drafts as I work through my thoughts, which has been fruitful. My goal is to have a fully polished proposal by the 20th, thus giving me 10 days to circulate that draft and revise according to feedback. (A little tight, but I can revise fast if I focus!) I wanted to solicit your opinion on a broad directional question I'm facing. I'm currently mulling over two lines of thought:

1. Maintaining a very tight chronological focus of, say, 1790-1810, I would examine a selection of writers who used a multiplicity of generic forms. (Right now, I am interested in Mary Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Charlotte Smith.) I would contextualize those writers, as best as possible, in relationship to the total cultural output of the sliver of time I've selected; even twenty years might be too broad. My goal would be to discover the continuities within the mediascape, and to produce a compellingly rich interpretation of the effects of each writer's generic choices. Given my past research suggesting that Ann Radcliffe is in fact markedly unlike the majority of texts assumed to duplicate her 'school', I would likely also examine the extent to which the writers I select can really be generalized as representative of broader trends. Computationally, I imagine myself using databases and spreadsheets to organize large amounts of disparate information. My reading distance would be quite close, with the 'novelty' coming from an attempt to chronologically unify a wide range of materials.

2. Throwing a wide chronological net, say, 1750-1830, I would seek insight not into individual authors' writing practice but into general usage. 'Case study' literary works would emerge from distant computational assessment. This scope is more in line with the works I most enjoy reading (E.J. Clery's Rise of Supernatural Fiction, for example, or Leah Price's Anthology and the Rise of the Novel) but whereas I feel like I can try to make sense of "everything, 1790-1810," the task of "everything, 1750-1830" seems obviously much too big. Two options interest me: looking at the titles of works (e.g., the play that calls itself a novel, or the Memoir vs Life vs History we discussed) and accumulating a lot of texts to see what, if anything, these titles are promising their readers. Or, sidelining genre as an interest to pursue intertextuality, finding places where writers quote or reference Shakespeare, and figuring out how they're using him and why. Computationally, I imagine myself writing programs to process particular information from plain-text copies of the various works. Title genres would give me a good place to start with topic modelling, and for the uses of Shakespeare I could easily write a program to spot Shakespeare quotes. My reading distance would be much farther, with closer readings coming in only after my computational methods have identified a text as of potential interest.

The "uses of Shakespeare" question feels exciting partly because it is the one for which I can most clearly envision the next steps, but that may also be because it's the newest idea. (My guess is that the "uses of Shakespeare" would offer insight on the things that already interest me regarding the basis and use of the literary canon, the theatricality of the Gothic, the interconnectedness of artistic forms, etc, while offering a practical means of maintaining focus.) But I'd be keen to hear what sounds potentially fruitful to you.

I'm hoping that, by narrowing down which of these specific research questions I will focus on, I will also answer for myself whether my special fields reading list ought to be a short chronological period of a broad thematic one.

Many thanks,
Lawrence

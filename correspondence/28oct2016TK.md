Dr. Keymer,

[Hello! I hope you have had a good break!]

[Alex Gillespie suggested that I reach out to you. I am a Ph.D. student in the English department here, just finished with comps and putting together my dissertation proposal.]

[I am interested in the 18thC and DH. It's the DH element which has led me to my somewhat unusual supervisory set-up.][Alex will be helping me build a portfolio in DH and Terry will be directing but I would be grateful for someone with so much experience in 18thC and the book history perspective would be useful]

[My research to this point has centered on comparing Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis to their now-forgotten contemporaries.] [key results] [I care about "the great unread" and Franco Moretti]

[For my dissertation, I'd like to break away from the habit of the Gothic novel as a self-contained, singular, easily-identifiable object.] [I'd like to take advantage of the scope of the dissertation to consider popular writing, broadly construed, in the period 1789-1816 (to track major developments in France).]

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro</strong><br/>The literature of sensibility — which I take to encompass sentimental literature through its evolution into the gothic — presents a value system based in feeling, but engaged in a constant negotiation regarding the failure points of its own convictions. For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of “virtue in distress,” it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both “distress” and “virtue.” A detailed examination of individual works’ navigation of these co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Wakefield (1766)</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>not a satire</strong><br/>There is a wide body of literary criticism beginning in the 1960s which treats Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) as a satirical novel lampooning sentimentality, based on the evaluation that the story is too saccharine and contrived to be sincere. As Vera Nünning points out, however, readers in the 18th and 19th centuries near-universally agreed that the novel was an exemplar of sentimentality’s delights. 20th century critics who declare the novel satirical based on the vicar's sel...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>self-serving moral superiority</strong><br/>The “virtue” presented in Wakefield seems calculated for readers to enjoy identifying with Primrose’s clear moral superiority. Despite its escalating cavalcade of miseries, which to modern readers take on a comic tone in their excesses, the novel presents no conflict. It is only material comfort which conflicts with duty, never feeling, thus making Primrose’s path to virtue always clear to him. When Primrose is presented with unpalatable paperwork like a proto-heroine, for example, he is never t...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>critique of wealth</strong><br/>This sermon is among those which presents Wakefield’s striking critique of wealth. Primrose argues that capital punishment for crimes other than murder wrongly prioritizes the interests of the rich above the interests of humanity. Insisting that “it is far better that two men should live, than that one man should ride,” in the case of horse theft, Primrose frames property law itself as a violation of natural law. Given the importance that England’s inviolable property laws will take on during th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>balancing-act conclusion</strong><br/>Primrose delivers this sermon, and then immediately in the next chapter the novel proceeds to provide all of the pleasures and rewards which it has lectured readers not to expect. Sir William Thornhill arrives as a messianic figure who has been watching the Primrose family in mortal guise and will now administer wide-reaching justice. The satisfaction of vindication and the comfort of material security flood into the narrative in a reversal of fortune as easy to laugh at as Primrose’s original a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Simple Story (1791)</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>sentimental fails</strong><br/>Elizabeth Inchbald’s A Simple Story (1791) has an entirely different political and moral agenda from Wakefield, but engages with similar problems of mental superiority and the embrace of misery. The novel is presented as a testing-ground for ideas of personal reform and educaton, attempting to work out how one is meant to acquire the strength of mind necessary for virtue, and reaching the uncomfortable conclusion that it cannot be done without distress. The novel’s decidedly un-simple two-part s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>it's kind of the same again</strong><br/>The second half of the novel thus, structurally at least, promises a corrective to Miss Milner’s and Dorriforth’s missteps, in their daughter Matilda’s marriage plot with her cousin Rushworth. The novel’s fulfillment of this promise is ambiguous at best, however. Among the mistakes made by Miss Milner and Dorriforth in the first half seems to have been an unwillingness to face their acknowledge the strength of their feelings, which prevents them from responding to them appropriately, and leads t...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>suffer like a heroine</strong><br/>If this is so, it is so not because Matilda and Rushworth act fundamentally different from their predecessors — it works because they both, and especially Matilda, now have such lowered expectations that, in accordance with Wakefield’s doctrine that pleasure is increased by the contrast with suffering, the same outcome constitutes a greater satisfaction for both of them. Unlike Miss Milner, Matilda is “[e]ducated in the school of adversity,” which means that “inured to retirement from her infanc...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>striking message in favor of distress</strong><br/>Responses to the novel often say that its conclusion is ambiguous or confusing, because its most obvious conclusion is unpalatable. Like Wakefield, A Simple Story presents a critique of wealth which can extend to a disavowal of the possession of wealth itself: “What is it makes wealth valuable? Is it the pleasures of the table? the pleasure of living in a fine house? or of wearing fine cloaths? These are pleasures, a Lord enjoys, but in common with his valet. … if we are conspicuous only for our...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Captive (1803)</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how plays usually adapt sentiment</strong><br/>Of course, the safest way to experience the moral improvements of distress, in the eighteenth century, was to go to the theatre to see a tragedy. When the literature of sensibility transitions to the stage, it no longer addresses an audience of one reader, whose reflections in distress it has leisure to philosophize over. Instead, theatrical productions of sensibility seek to unite their widely differeing audience members into a shared experience of feeling and resolution. In so doing, they heig...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what makes captive different</strong><br/>In this context, Matthew Lewis’s The Captive (1803) provides an example of an interesting failure. The previous works discussed all provide a safe ground within which their audiences can practice embracing misery, and have that misery vindicated and comfortably resolved. The Captive, in contrast, begins from the same expectations, but betrays its audiences into an experience that overwhelms. It uses the systems of sensibility to engage its audience’s feelings at the highest pitch, and then destr...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>In its misfire, The Captive reveals the necessity, in the literature of sensibility, for distress to be contained within the comforting frameworks that Wakefield and A Simple Story employ, so that it may be palatably embraced by its audience. Submission may not appeal to contemporary readers as a virtuous response to distress. On its own, it smacks of too little justice; and if a deus ex machina supplies the justice, this feels unsatisfyingly unrealistic. To say that the literature of sensibilit...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Paper B: 5. what is lost in distant reading</strong><br/>What is to be lost by distant reading? Ground your answer in both theory and practice, with reference to at least three literary texts from your reading list.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro: lose monoliths</strong><br/>Every distant reading methodology has, hard-coded into it, its own priorities regarding what to emphasize and what to lose. Something does have to be lost in any model of a text: as Willard McCarty astutely outlines, models are useful because they don’t perfectly replicate that which they model, so that the resulting model will simplify away the less-relevant-right-now details in exchange for greater sensitivity to the details under examination. Often, what distant-readers choose to lose are thi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>anthologies</strong></p>

<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>anthologies are models</strong><br/>Anthologies represent the simplified models of a literary period which their editors believe is best-suited to introduce high school and undergraduate students to that period. These models are not “distant reading” models, since they do not attempt to draw conclusions about the anthologized texts as a corpus; instead, teachers are expected to select the subset of texts which suit their particular needs and supply the gap between the anthology and “Romanticism” by contextualizing and close-readin...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tokenism - Dorothy</strong><br/>The obligatory anthologization of Dorothy Wordsworth, for example, strikes me as misguided. Her journals are fascinating documents, but they are also private, not constructed as literature. Even the concept of “the Grasmere Journal” as a distinct entity reflects an interpretation meant to serve scholars’ interest in her brother, rather than a full understanding of the documents themselves. The second manuscript included in “the Grasmere Journal,” in addition to other fascinating miscellany refle...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tokenism - CSmith rocks</strong><br/>Similarly, but with the opposite tendency, Charlotte Smith’s inclusion always near Wordsworth — in the Longman anthology, actually embedded among the Lyrical Ballads as “context” for Wordsworth — gives the entirely false impression that she is interesting primarily for her impact on Wordsworth, rather than as a crucial Romantic poet in her own right. As Knowles and Horrocks point out, Smith was at the centre of the English literary canon in 1798 when Lyrical Ballads was printed — her Elegiac Son...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Thorn</strong><br/>Wordsworth’s and Smith’s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards their public reputation, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, “The Thorn” and “On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.” Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>On being cautioned</strong><br/>In contrast, Smith’s “On being cautioned” positions her poetic persona as not only the recipient of an alarming tale, but one who pursues that tale intentionally. Some readings of this poem make much hay out of the fact that Smith’s encounter with the eponymous lunatic is imagined, but I note that nowhere does she say that the caution she has been given is successful. One can easily read the poem as describing her continued walk toward the precipice. Even if Smith herself did not go, it is in ke...</p>

</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no power law</strong><br/>But anthologies are not the only place to look for Wordsworth’s peers. If we return to the anthology as a model of Romanticism, but this time consider a graph instead of a chart, it is immediately notable that the distribution of pages by author does not follow a power-law distribution. Most natural phenomena (and many human phenomena) show a power-law distribution, in which the most frequently-appearing items appear exponentially more than the less frequent items. In any given written work, for...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC</strong><br/>That anthologies have selection criteria is not meant to be a surprise, either. But I thought it would be informative to compare the list against a less-curated body of texts. My point of comparison comes from data I have accumulated for my dissertation: the titles of roughly 52,000 words printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799. These titles, then, constitute the public world of letters in the decade leading up to the publication of Lyrical Ballads. Interestingly, this collecton of tex...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Robert and Richard</strong><br/>Wordsworth’s intentional avoidance of mass print, however, does not prevent us from reading “The Thorn” again against another poem making use of gothic materials: Hannah More’s “Robert and Richard, or, the ghost of poor Molly, who was drowned in Richard’s mill pond.” More promises a ghost in the title of this Cheap Repository Tract, likely knowing that it would be competing for sale with other ghost stories among the chapbook hawkers that she used to distribute her Cheap Repository Tracts.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>edit the anthoogies</strong><br/>More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her “Strictures on Female Education” appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and “Sorrows of Yamba” in two for the section on slavery, and even “Village Politics” appears in Longman. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of “Robert and Richard” on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But if Dorothy Wordsworth were removed, and Charlotte Smith moved from “context” to Dorothy Wordsworth’s vacant “auth...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>REALLY edit anthologies</strong><br/>Of course, shuffling around a few authors does not address the core problem. Katherine Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems. I’m intrigued by Philip Cox’s chronological edition of Keats, which mixes letters and poems. The question of anthology and teaching is not one to be solved here, or it would be solved already, and there are real reasons for anthologies to be organized he way they are — I initially scoffed at an online review of the Broadview anthology’s tendency to distrib...</p>

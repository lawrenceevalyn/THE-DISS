<p class="binderItem"><strong>Paper A: 3. case for lit of sensibility</strong><br/>Can a serious case be made for the literature of sensibility on aesthetic and/or ethical and/or political grounds? Discuss at least three literary texts from your reading list in at least two different genres.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro</strong><br/>The literature of sensibility, which foregrounds feeling, [They’re all trying to work out a value system that can serve as a viable alternative to money and rationalism, placing family ties and feeling at the centre. And then bouncing off the limits of that value system.] For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of “virtue in distress,” it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both “distress” and “virtue.” To be compelling, these definitions must both r...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Wakefield (1766)</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>not a satire</strong><br/>Although the novel was initially successful on these aesthetic terms, as its definition of “virtue” lost its persuasiveness, it soon began to seem embarassingly over-earnest to readers, so much so that many critics now read it as a satire of the sentimental views it espouses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>feeling against money</strong><br/>In The Vicar of Wakefield, feeling is used as an alternative value system to money. As the Primrose family grows poorer and poorer, this proves their love stronger and stronger. Despite its escalating cavalcade of miseries, which to modern readers take on a comic tone in their excesses, the novel presents no conflict. It is only material comfort which conflicts with duty, never feeling, as when Primrose refuses to sign away his daughter’s reputation even to escape debtor’s prison, thus making Pr...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>virtue is endurance</strong><br/>The novel thus articulates a virtue which consists in an embrace of and mental superiority to the attacks of others. The more stirringly one articulates the wrongs one endures, the greater one’s virtue is in submitting to these wrongs without resistance. The presence of extensive complaint without action — indeed, while actively working against the actions taken on his behalf by, for example, the parishoners who wish to prevent his being jailed — is easily critiqued as ineffective, but passive s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>pleasure of superiority (prison)</strong><br/>The novel then proceeds to provide all of the pleasures and rewards which it has lectured readers not to expect. The satisfaction of vindication and the comfort of material security flood into the narrative in a reversal of fortune as easy to laugh at as Primrose’s original accumulation of miseries. Satisfaction arrives first: Primrose has always had confidence in his own moral uprightness, but as he begins to convert his fellow prisoners, he can enjoy the acknowledgement of his virtue. The narr...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>reversal of fortune</strong><br/>Where the main body of the novel saw, for example, Primrose’s son dragged into prison bloody and fettered while Primrose is mid-sentence expressing delight that this son remains the only family member secure from harm, the conclusion struggles to shove in all their resolutions. In one particularly dense moment, Primrose descibes that “We now sate down to dinner, which was almost cold; but previously, my arm still continuing painful, Sir William wrote a prescription, for he had made the study of ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>mercy</strong><br/>The more difficult ethical lesson in the novel is its mercy: its religious message defers all punishment to the afterlife, and holds that no one is past reform, and so its final reversal of fortune stymies any thirst for revenge among its readers. The con man who financially ruined Primrose’s family, when discovered as a fellow prisoner, is promptly forgiven and embraced as a friend despite his lack of repentance. Squire Thornhill, who has tyrannized the Primrose family for most of the novel, is...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Simple Story (1791)</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>need distress to gain mental resources</strong><br/>In A Simple Story, Inchbald tries to work out how one is supposed to go about acquiring virtue, and reaches the disheartening answer that is cannot be done without distress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>sentimental fails</strong><br/>The novel’s decidedly un-simple two-part structure depicts a sentimental love story that results in a gothic one. The story appears to promise the reform of a sensible, fashionable woman into the happy wife of a sensible, refined gentleman. Together they bear up under the distresses of their marriage plot by virtue of their deep feeling. Miss Milner, in particular, is attentively monitored for signs of vice, but demonstrates obedience by refraining from forbidden amusements, even when her guardi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>gothic more successful</strong><br/>Despite the many moments of satisfying vindication that their heightened feelings brought to them, Inchbald’s narrative suggests, something is unsound in the foundations of their principles. The concluding moral informs us that Matilda succeeds where her mother failed becuse Matilda has a “proper education,” but her story is extremely similar.<br/>
The gothic education she recieves serves her well enough to form a sedate, friendly attachment to her cousin and to concede to a marriage when he asks for...</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>suffer like a heroine</strong><br/>Critics often draw attention to the domestic tyrannies Dorriforth inflicts on Miss Milner in the first half, his tests of obedience and his enraged outburts, as a translation of his later tyranny rendered on a domestic scale to make it more identifiable in readers’ own lives. His daughter Matilda must navigate the same tyrant. <br/>
Unlike Miss Milner, however, she is “Educated in the school of adversity, and inured to retirement from her infancy, she had acquired a taste for all those amusements whi...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>striking message in favor of distress</strong><br/>Responses to the novel often say that its conclusion is ambiguous or confusing, because its most obvious conclusion is unpalatable.<br/>
Like Wakefield, Simple Story presents a critique of wealth which can extend to a disavowal of the possession of wealth itself: “What is it makes wealth valuable? Is it the pleasures of the table? the pleasure of living in a fine house? or of wearing fine cloaths? These are pleasures, a Lord enjoys, but in common with his valet. It is the pleasure of being conspicuou...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>And so again, as in both Wakefield and Percy, the knowledge of one’s own virtue is the greatest pleasure in life, and submission to tyranny and distress the best way to heighten that pleasure. Indeed, in A Simple Story, it seems possible that distress is the only way to acquire that virtue in the first place. And again, the case for the literature of sensibility is its ability to present a distinctly other moral system.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Captive (1803)</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>presents a wrong kind of distress</strong><br/>Wakefield and Simple Story both provide a safe ground within with their audiences can practice embracing misery, and have that misery vindicated and comfortably resolved.Matthew Lewis’s challenging monodrama, The Captive, begins from the same expectations, but betrays its audiences trust into an overwhelming experience. The play overwhelms because it uses the systems of sensibility to engage its audience’s feelings at the highest pitch, and then destroys the accepted boundaries of that framework...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>Submission may not appeal to contemporary readers as a virtuous response to distress. On its own, it smacks of too little justice; and if a deus ex machina supplies the justice, this feels unsatisfyingly unrealistic. To say that the literature of sensibility constitutes a sustained engagement with the aesthetics and ethics of submission to authority may not, therefore, constitute a serious case “for” these texts. But in their central acknowledgement of feeling, they supply a crucial lack in enli...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Paper B: 5. what is lost in distant reading</strong><br/>What is to be lost by distant reading? Ground your answer in both theory and practice, with reference to at least three literary texts from your reading list.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro: lose monoliths</strong><br/>Every distant reading methodology has, hard-coded into it, its own priorities regarding what to emphasize and what to lose. Something does have to be lost in any model of a text: as Willard McCarty astutely outlines, models are useful because they don’t perfectly replicate that which they model, so that the resulting model will simplify away the less-relevant-right-now details in exchange for greater sensitivity to the details under examination. Often, what distant-readers choose to lose are thi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>anthologies</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>anthologies are models</strong><br/>Anthologies represent the simplified models of a literary period which their editors believe is best-suited to introduce high school and undergraduate students to that period. These models are not “distant reading” models, since they do not attempt to draw conclusions about the anthologized texts as a corpus; instead, teachers are expected to select the subset of texts which suit their particular needs and supply the gap between the anthology and “Romanticism” by contextualizing and close-readin...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tokenism - Dorothy</strong><br/>The obligatory anthologization of Dorothy Wordsworth, for example, strikes me as misguided. Her journals are fascinating documents, but they are also private, not constructed as literature. Even the concept of “the Grasmere Journal” as a distinct entity reflects an interpretation meant to serve scholars’ interest in her brother, rather than a full understanding of the documents themselves. The second manuscript included in “the Grasmere Journal,” in addition to other fascinating miscellany refle...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tokenism - CSmith rocks</strong><br/>Similarly, but with the opposite tendency, Charlotte Smith’s inclusion always near Wordsworth — in the Longman anthology, actually embedded among the Lyrical Ballads as “context” for Wordsworth — gives the entirely false impression that she is interesting primarily for her impact on Wordsworth, rather than as a crucial Romantic poet in her own right. As Knowles and Horrocks point out, Smith was at the centre of the English literary canon in 1798 when Lyrical Ballads was printed — her Elegiac Son...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>WW & CSmith</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Thorn</strong><br/>Wordsworth’s and Smith’s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards their public reputation, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, “The Thorn” and “On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.” Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>On being cautioned</strong><br/>In contrast, Smith’s “On being cautioned” positions her poetic persona as not only the recipient of an alarming tale, but one who pursues that tale intentionally. Some readings of this poem make much hay out of the fact that Smith’s encounter with the eponymous lunatic is imagined, but I note that nowhere does she say that the caution she has been given is successful. One can easily read the poem as describing her continued walk toward the precipice. Even if Smith herself did not go, it is in ke...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>the alternative is Hannah More</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no power law</strong><br/>But anthologies are not the only place to look for Wordsworth’s peers. If we return to the anthology as a model of Romanticism, but this time consider a graph instead of a chart, it is immediately notable that the distribution of pages by author does not follow a power-law distribution. Most natural phenomena (and many human phenomena) show a power-law distribution, in which the most frequently-appearing items appear exponentially more than the less frequent items. In any given written work, for...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC</strong><br/>That anthologies have selection criteria is not meant to be a surprise, either. But I thought it would be informative to compare the list against a less-curated body of texts. My point of comparison comes from data I have accumulated for my dissertation: the titles of roughly 52,000 words printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799. These titles, then, constitute the public world of letters in the decade leading up to the publication of Lyrical Ballads. Interestingly, this collecton of tex...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Robert and Richard</strong><br/>Wordsworth’s intentional avoidance of mass print, however, does not prevent us from reading “The Thorn” again against another poem making use of gothic materials: Hannah More’s “Robert and Richard, or, the ghost of poor Molly, who was drowned in Richard’s mill pond.” More promises a ghost in the title of this Cheap Repository Tract, likely knowing that it would be competing for sale with other ghost stories among the chapbook hawkers that she used to distribute her Cheap Repository Tracts.

<ul>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>edit the anthoogies</strong><br/>More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her “Strictures on Female Education” appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and “Sorrows of Yamba” in two for the section on slavery, and even “Village Politics” appears in Longman. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of “Robert and Richard” on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But if Dorothy Wordsworth were removed, and Charlotte Smith moved from “context” to Dorothy Wordsworth’s vacant “auth...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>probably I wouldn't do anthologies at all</strong><br/>Of course, shuffling around a few authors does not address the core problem. Katherine Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems. Ted Underwood suggests ???. I’m intrigued by Philip Cox’s chronological edition of Keats, which mixes letters and poems. The question of anthology and teaching is not one to be solved here, or it would be solved already, and there are real reasons for anthologies to be organized he way they are — I initially scoffed at an online review of the Broadview ant...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>the canon is always artificial</strong><br/>The “canon” has always been an artificial intention to serve the agenda of a generation. What this means is not that we must burn the Norton anthology, but that we should thoughtfully begin again each time our agenda changes. Although I complain about the tokenism of Dorothy Wordsworth, tokenism works: the recapture of Frankenstein is an excellent example.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>focus on alterity</strong><br/>In reaching out to undergraduates, their immediate metric of assessment is often “relatability,” followed by “likability”. Setting aside the matter that Byron is only going to be “relatable” and “likable” to someone with a high tolerance for misogyny, these metrics miss the point of exposing students to the literary past in the first place. I argue for an emphasis on alterity and surprise.</p>

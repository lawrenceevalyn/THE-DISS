<p class="binderItem"><strong>Paper A: 3. case for lit of sensibility</strong><br/>Can a serious case be made for the literature of sensibility on aesthetic and/or ethical and/or political grounds? Discuss at least three literary texts from your reading list in at least two different genres.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro</strong><br/>For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of “virtue in distress,” it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both “distress” and “virtue.” The literature of sensibility — which I take to encompass sentimental literature through its evolution into the gothic — is thus engaged in a constant negotiation regarding the failure points of its own convictions. The premise of sensibility is a valuation of feeling, but feeling easily amplifies distress and, when it...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Wakefield (1766)</strong><br/>In The Vicar of Wakefield, feeling is used as an alternative value system to money. As the Primrose family grows poorer and poorer, this proves their love stronger and stronger. It is only money which conflicts with duty, never feeling, as when Primrose refuses to sign away his daughter’s reputation even to escape debtor’s prison. The novel thus articulates a kind of virtue which consists in endurance of and mental superiority to the attacks of others. The pleasure of this virtue comes in a sens...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Percy (1778)</strong><br/>When sentimental literature is attached to the marriage plot, the conflict is no longer between feeling and money, but between feeling and familial duty. In Percy, the message of The Vicar of Wakefield — that virtue has its rewards in futurity, and usually incurs greater distresses on earth — is presented without an escapist reversal of fortune at the end. At the outset of the play, Elwina has submitted to her duty uncomplainingly, and married a man to whom she is indifferent, but her husband at...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Simple Story (1791)</strong><br/>In A Simple Story, feeling must battle both money and duty. Inchbald tries to work out how one is supposed to go about acquiring the mental resources necessary to discipline feeling, and reaches the disheartening answer that is cannot be done without distress. The novel’s decidedly un-simple two-part structure depicts a sentimental love story that results in a gothic one. The story appears to promise the reform of a sensible, fashionable woman into the happy wife of a sensible, refined gentleman...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Captive (1803)</strong><br/>This discussion of virtue and distress allows a complex discussion of Matthew Lewis’s challenging monodrama, The Captive. The play overwhelms because it uses the systems of sensibility to engage its audience’s feelings at the highest pitch, and then destroys the accepted systems of that framework. The eponymous heroine is at the peak of sensible distress: imprisoned in physical distress like Dr Primrose, misbelieved like Elwina, mistreated by someone who is meant to care for her like Matilda. He...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>Submission may not appeal to contemporary readers as a virtuous response to distress. On its own, it smacks of too little justice; but if a deus ex machina supplies the justice, this feels unsatisfyingly unrealistic. Submission is also certainly politically distateful; it is no surprise that the two religious writers are much more successful at providing the comforts of submission than radical Inchbald and “Monk” Lewis. To say that the literature of sensibility constitutes a sustained engagement...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Paper B: 5. what is lost in distant reading</strong><br/>What is to be lost by distant reading? Ground your answer in both theory and practice, with reference to at least three literary texts from your reading list.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro: lose inviolability</strong><br/>What ought to be lost in distant reading, I argue, is the sense of a text’s inviolability. Many other things can be, and have been, lost in past distant readings — notably, attention to textual provenance — but these do not have to be lost. Something does have to be lost in any model of a text: as Willard McCarty astutely outlines, models are useful because they don’t perfectly replicate that which they model. But an individual human’s memory of a text, or a set of quotations copied out in a gro...</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>also lose focus on 3 texts</strong><br/>It is, of course, possible to distant-read invidual texts — I have done it often — but distant reading is at its most exciting when it uses its distance to bring more objects into view simultaneously than can easily be considered at once using other methods. Accordingly, one thing which distant reading also loses is the assumption that questions are answered with reference to three texts. But the classic “compromise position” for distant-reading — which does have its virtues — is to serve, essen...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>anthologies</strong><br/>My model of the contemporary canon is taken from three anthologies of Romanticism: Norton, Longman, and Broadview. I examined the tables of contents of all three anthologies, calculating the number of pages devoted to each author, with some details on which works are included. Bettina Fischer-Starcke says that the most important things in linguistics are also the most common. Evidently, Romanticism is 12% Wordsworth by volume. He only barely edges out Byron, who also rounds to 12%. Wordsworth, B...</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tokenism - cut Dorothy</strong><br/>This model is not meant to surprise, but it does, I think, highlight the uncomfortable strategies necessary to reconcile a broadening canon with the “parade of authors” structure of canon. To counteract the promulgation of a masculinist Romanticism, the concrete manifestation in an anthology is the inclusion of “nearby” women. The frequent anthologization of Dorothy Wordsworth, for example, strikes me as misguided: the Grasmere and Alfoxden journals are fascinating documents, but they are also p...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>tokenism - CSmith rocks</strong><br/>Similarly, but with the opposite tendency, Charlotte Smith’s inclusion always near Wordsworth — in the Longman anthology, embedded among the Lyrical Ballads as “context” for Wordsworth — gives the entirely false impression that she is interesting primarily for her impact on Wordsworth, rather than as a crucial Romantic poet in her own right. As Knowles and Horrocks point out, Smith was at the centre of the English literary canon in 1798 when Lyrical Ballads was printed — her Elegiac Sonnets had ...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Thorn</strong><br/>Wordsworth’s and Smith’s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards their public reputation, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, “The Thorn” and “On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.” Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>On being cautioned</strong><br/>In contrast, Smith’s “On being cautioned” positions her poetic persona as not only the recipient of an alarming tale, but one who pursues that tale intentionally. Some readings of this poem make much hay out of the fact that Smith’s encounter with the eponymous lunatic is imagined, but I note that nowhere does she say that the caution she has been given is successful. One can easily read the poem as describing her continued walk toward the precipice. Even if Smith herself did not go, it is in ke...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no power law</strong><br/>But anthologies are not the only place to look for Wordsworth’s peers. If we return to the anthology as a model of Romanticism, but this time consider a graph instead of a chart, it is immediately notable that the distribution of pages by author does not follow a power-law distribtuon. Most natural phenomena (and many human phenomena) show a power-law distribution, in which the most frequently-appearing items appear exponentially more than the less frequent items. In any given written work, for ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC</strong><br/>That anthologies have selection criteria is not meant to be a surprise, either. But I thought it would be informative to compare the list against a less-curated body of texts. My point of comparison comes from data I have accumulated for my dissertation: the titles of roughly 52,000 words printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799. These titles, then, constitute the public world of letters in the decade leading up to the publication of Lyrical Ballads. Interestingly, this collecton of tex...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Robert and Richard</strong><br/>Wordsworth’s intentional avoidance of mass print, however, does not prevent us from reading “The Thorn” again against another poem making use of gothic materials: Hannah More’s “Robert and Richard, or, the ghost of poor Molly, who was drowned in Richard’s mill pond.” More promises a ghost in the title of this Cheap Repository Tract, likely knowing that it would be competing for sale with other ghost stories among the chapbook hawkers that she used to distribute her Cheap Repository Tracts. More ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her “Strictures on Female Education” appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and “Sorrows of Yamba” in two for the section on slavery, and even “Village Politics” appears in Longman. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of “Robert and Richard” on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But if Dorothy Wordsworth were removed, and Charlotte Smith moved from the “context” section to Dorothy Wordsworth’s ...</p>

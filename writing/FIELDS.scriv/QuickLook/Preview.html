<p class="binderItem"><strong>3. case for lit of sensibility</strong><br/>Can a serious case be made for the literature of sensibility on aesthetic and/or ethical and/or political grounds? Discuss at least three literary texts from your reading list in at least two different genres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>virtue in distress: aesthetic & ethical</strong><br/>For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of “virtue in distress,” it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both “distress” and “virtue.” The literature of sensibility — which I take to encompass sentimental literature through its evolution into the gothic — is thus engaged in a constant negotiation regarding the failure points of its own convictions. The premise of sensibility is a valuation of feeling, but feeling easily amplifies distress and, when it...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>intro</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>lots has been lost</strong><br/>All kinds of things can be and have been lost in distant reading. [Good place to rag on bad distant reading; as Katherine Bode cogently argues, critiques of Moretti and Jockers aren’t all harrumphing but respond to a real lack]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>do have to lose something</strong><br/>Willard McCarty tells us that something must be lost in order for a model to usefully simplify and thus enable detail in a new area and manipulability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>let's lose 'individual genius'</strong><br/>What I think should be lost is the myth of individual genius. [Will need to spend some time on defining this, ref Wordsworth]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>lose untouchable 'genius'</strong><br/>Losing the “genius” means no longer treating works as immutable and untouchable, but instead considering other ways they could have been and could be now. (Cf Sedgewick and paranoid reading)</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>'index to tears' is hostile</strong><br/>the “index to tears” added to Victorian editions of The Man of Feeling suggests a deformative reading practice that was originally conceived as hostile in its distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>but it can be repaired</strong><br/>can nonetheless draw attention to interesting features of the work. (Need to lose sense of text’s authority for it to become manipulable.)<br/>
Can Man of Feeling / Index to Tears be made to shed metaphorical light on the problem of distant reading??</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>lose 'individual'</strong><br/>Losing the focus on the “individual” means not answering questions with reference to three texts, but studying groups or (as per Katherine Bode) systems.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>compare anthologies</strong><br/>To enact that distinction, I will briefly consider the groupings/systems of three major anthologies of Romantic literature, and discuss what this distant reading gains and loses, using it as a ‘finding aid’ for my final two works: one work from my list which is included in all three anthologies, and one that is included in none.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>systems finding</strong><br/>I learn some cool things about the anthologies’ structure. (So they have power-law distribution, or not? — Always expect the power-law!)</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>some people are just "context"</strong></p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>it's wordsworth and byron!</strong><br/>Following the premise outlined in Fischer-Starcke that what is most prevalent is also most important, Romanticism is 12% Wordsworth by volume! And 12% Byron.<br/>
Wordsworth, Byron, Percy Shelley, Coleridge, Keats, and Mary Shelley together make up half of Romanticism. (Mary Shelley’s prominence is partly due to the fact that the Longman anthology includes the entirety of Frankenstein; if we bumped her down, Mary Wollstonecraft takes next place. And even with all of Frankenstein, she is still beaten ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>compare Robert & Richard to The Thorn?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Barbauld's poem to Coleridge?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>pick a poem by Ann Radcliffe??</strong><br/>Radcliffe’s poetry matters: widespread agreement at the time that it should be read independently of the novels; some printed in periodicals; so much interest that an unauthorized anthology was made.<br/>
(Can I find something with metaphorical resonance re: distant reading??)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>In conclusion, for distant reading to also be reconcilable with reparative reading (as I wish it to be), it is important that what is lost is the Romantic propaganda that McGann and others complain we still have not let go of, and that what is not lost is intimacy or an attentiveness to the real variety of the source material.</p>

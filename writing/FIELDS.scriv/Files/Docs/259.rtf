The more difficult ethical lesson in the novel is its mercy: its religious message defers all punishment to the afterlife, and holds that no one is past reform, and so its final reversal of fortune stymies any thirst for revenge among its readers. The con man who financially ruined Primrose\'92s family, when discovered as a fellow prisoner, is promptly forgiven and embraced as a friend despite his lack of repentance. Squire Thornhill, who has tyrannized the Primrose family for most of the novel, is initially exposed and mocked \'97 his lackeys tell him to his face how much they dislike him, and his uncle humbles and disciplines him \'97 but rather than being utterly ruined, he is sent to the country to live as the companion to a relative, \'93being very well liked,\'94 amusing his melancholy cousing, and \'93learning to blow the French-horn.\'94 As a narrative comeuppance this resolution is lacking. Most strikingly, Primrose hints that \'93when he reforms\'94 his daughter, his legal wife, \'93she may be brought to relent.\'94}

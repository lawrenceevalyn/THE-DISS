The novel thus articulates a virtue which consists in an embrace of and mental superiority to the attacks of others. The more stirringly one articulates the wrongs one endures, the greater one\'92s virtue is in submitting to these wrongs without resistance.

In a sermon to his fellow prisoners in chapter 20, Primrose declares, \'93Yes, my friends, we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature,\'94 and stirringly describes the archetypal \'93wants\'94 which literary imagination cannot make disappear.

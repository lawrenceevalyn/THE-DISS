Submission may not appeal to contemporary readers as a virtuous response to distress. On its own, it smacks of too little justice; but if a deus ex machina supplies the justice, this feels unsatisfyingly unrealistic. Submission is also certainly politically distateful; it is no surprise that the two religious writers are much more successful at providing the comforts of submission than radical Inchbald and \'93Monk\'94 Lewis. To say that the literature of sensibility constitutes a sustained engagement with the aesthetics and ethics of submission to authority may not, therefore, constitute a serious case \'93for\'94 these texts. But in their central acknowledgement of feeling, they supply a crucial lack in enlightenment discourses on virtue. And in their provision of narrative vindication, they can provide supreme pleasure to the readers who buy their premise.}

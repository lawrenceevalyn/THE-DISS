Wordsworth\'92s and Smith\'92s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards their public reputation, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, \'93The Thorn\'94 and \'93On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.\'94 Wordsworth\'92s \'93The Thorn,\'94 famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a similar moral superiority to salacious gossip. The reader can understand, as the speaker of the poem cannot, the metaphorical resonance why which the thorn is Martha Ray, harmfully dragged to the ground by lichens like the poem\'92s speaker himself who cheerfully relates every scrap of speculation which he has heard, and wishes he had more. Michael Gamer has astutely described how Wordsworth, in this poem, benefits from the public taste for supernatural and miserable tales, while crafting a serious reputation in opposition from the materials he uses. The poem\'92s speaker, too, disavows his sources and attempts to disdain them, even as he embellishes them with his own imagined details and claims the tale as a whole as a story which he, despite his status as a traveller, has the distinct right to tell.}

However, I will nonetheless respond to the anthologies\'92 implied assessment of Smith as a Wordsworthian interlocutor, to examine her and Wordsworth as a pair. Wordsworth\'92s and Smith\'92s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards the way they position their poetry within the public sphere, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, \'93The Thorn\'94 and \'93On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.\'94 Wordsworth\'92s \'93The Thorn,\'94 famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a similar moral superiority. The reader can understand, as the speaker of the poem cannot, the metaphorical resonance by which the thorn is Martha Ray, harmfully dragged to the ground by moss, the stand-in for gossipers like the poem\'92s speaker himself.\
Michael Gamer has astutely described how Wordsworth, in this poem, benefits from the public taste for supernatural and miserable tales, while crafting a serious reputation through a stance of opposition to the materials he uses. The poem\'92s speaker, too, even as he embellishes the tale with his own imagined details, disavows his sources and attempts to disdain them. He tries to attribute his salacious gossip to the generality, a public matter that \'93all the country know\'94 and \'93all and each agree\'94, by citing sources like \'93They say,\'94 \'93\cb3 some remember well,\cb1 \'94 \'93some will say,\'94 \'93Some say\'94 \'97 but he slips when he mentions \cb3 \'93Last Christmas-eve we talked of this,\'94 implicating himself in the conversation, and mentiones \'93grey-haired Wilfred of the glen\'94 as a specific source and personal acuaintance. When he begins a stanza with \'93one day with my telescope\'94 it almost seems possible that he used the device to spy on her misery, though the anecdote actually resolves into his walk to the mountaintop, where he accidentally meets Martha Ray directly, stares, and flees.}

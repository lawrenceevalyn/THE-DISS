For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of \'93virtue in distress,\'94 it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both \'93distress\'94 and \'93virtue.\'94 The literature of sensibility \'97 which I take to encompass sentimental literature through its evolution into the gothic \'97 is thus engaged in a constant negotiation regarding the failure points of its own convictions. The premise of sensibility is a valuation of feeling, but feeling easily amplifies distress and, when it conflicts with duty, impedes virtue.}

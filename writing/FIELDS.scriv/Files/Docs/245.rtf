My model of the contemporary canon is taken from three anthologies of Romanticism: Norton, Longman, and Broadview. I examined the tables of contents of all three anthologies, calculating the number of pages devoted to each author. Bettina Fischer-Starcke says that the most important things in linguistics are also the most common. Evidently, Romanticism is 12% Wordsworth by volume. He only barely edges out Byron, who also rounds to 12%. Wordsworth, Byron, Percy Shelley, Coleridge, Keats, and Mary {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://CCB0026E-84BE-426C-9412-85434A49D059"}}{\fldrslt Shelley}} together account for half of Romanticism; everybody else combined constitute the other half. This is, of course, the \'93big six,\'94 but with William Blake pushed aside (to 8

It is, of course, possible to distant-read invidual texts \'97 I have done it often \'97 but distant reading is at its most exciting when it uses its distance to bring more objects into view simultaneously than can easily be considered at once using other methods. Accordingly, one thing which distant reading also loses is the assumption that questions are answered with reference to three texts. But the classic \'93compromise position\'94 for distant-reading \'97 which does have its virtues \'97 is to serve, essentially, as a slick new \'93finding aid\'94 for more traditional research. Therefore, I have turned my attention to the canon of Romanticism as it is currently constructed, to seek the texts most crucial for a close-read comparison.}

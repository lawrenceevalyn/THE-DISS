\f0\fs20 \cf0 There is some precedent for including private documents in anthologies. Letters by Byron and Keats appear in all three anthologies, with letters from Charles Lamb, Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, and William Blake appearing in some. However, letters appear to have been less private than journals in the eighteenth century, often copied, read in groups, and even printed. In contrast, Dorothy Wordsworth\'92s frequently-anthologized entry on William\'92s marriage is, Pamela Woolf describes, \'93heavily covered with ink, not in order to correct or emend, but to make the words impossible to read.\'94 Woolf observes that \'93D herself, either soon afterwards or in later life, could have been the one to cross out the sentences, realizing as she must have, that the drama of tenderness of that morning was perhaps played over-consciously and in any case was not for other eyes \'97 not even perhaps for W\'92s\'94 \'97 and then sanguinely describes how the naked eye can nonetheless make out the words under a bright light, unlike other sections which required X-rays to extract the words Dorothy sought to conceal.}]]></Comment>

Where the main body of the novel saw, for example, Primrose\'92s son dragged into prison bloody and fettered while Primrose is mid-sentence expressing delight that this son remains the only family member secure from harm, the conclusion struggles to shove in all their resolutions. In one particularly dense moment, Primrose descibes that \'93We now sate down to dinner, which was almost cold; but previously, my arm still continuing painful, Sir William wrote a prescription, for he had made the study of physic his amusement\'94: the dinner, intended as a resolution for their acute hunger, has been delayed by the arrival of a daughter reported to be dead, and the narrator can barely remember the order in which lucky happenstances cure his ills.\
Sir William Thornhill arrives as a messianic figure who has been watching the Primrose family in mortal guise and will now administer wide-reaching justice. This resolution, too, prioritizes readers\'92 comfort by narratively delivering the rewards which are meant to be delayed.}

More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her \'93Strictures on Female Education\'94 appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and \'93Sorrows of Yamba\'94 in two for the section on slavery, and even \'93Village Politics\'94 appears in Longman. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of \'93Robert and Richard\'94 on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But if Dorothy Wordsworth were removed, and Charlotte Smith moved from \'93context\'94 to Dorothy Wordsworth\'92s vacant \'93author\'94 space, something like an actual contemporaneous ballad could be placed alongside William Wordsworth. This editorial change is highly speculative, but represents one possible amendation to the small and highly clustered network of \'93notable\'94 writers which I argue is to be lost with distant reading.\

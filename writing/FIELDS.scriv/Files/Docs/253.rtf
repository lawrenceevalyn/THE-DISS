More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her \'93Strictures on Female Education\'94 appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and \'93Sorrows of Yamba\'94 in two for the section on slavery, and even \'93Village Politics\'94 makes one appearance. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of \'93Robert and Richard\'94 on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But reading Wordsworth alongside a contemporary ballad produces a very different understanding of his literary borrowings than the typical anthology presentation of a few \'93ancient\'94 ballads at the very beginning of the volume. These slight and sourceless ballads, against which eager students could read Wordsworth\'92s intervention by flipping back to be beginning of the volume, largely serve to uphold Wordsworth own narrative of personalizing a common raw cultural material. Including as well something like \'93Robert and Richard\'94 would clarify the extent to which the ballad was a still-living popular form, with prominent political dimensions. Above I took this comparison as an opportunity to emphasize critiques of the poem, but it could also be used to highlight where Wordsworth\'92s claims of originality are most accurate.}

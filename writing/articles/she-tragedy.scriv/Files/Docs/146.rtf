I think my new argument is that, when women are first introduced to tragedies their mere spectacular presence is sufficient to make an enormous impression on the audience \'97 but as the genre of she-tragedy is established, the heroines become more similar to the male heroes they displace.\
(Does this reflect some kind of changing attitude about women\'92s agency?)}

<p class="binderItem"><strong>background</strong><br/>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>driving research Qs</strong><br/>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>critical context</strong><br/>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much bro...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>model 1: ESTC</strong><br/>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and majo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>model 2: ECCO-TCP</strong><br/>I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the Un...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>model 3: reading</strong><br/>Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositori...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>Although I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will research them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Context</strong><br/>Context of the Study – Provide a brief history of the issues to date. – Situate your particular topic within the broad area of research. – Note that the field is changing, and more research is required on your topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Problem statement</strong><br/> Problem Statement (or Motivation for the Study) – Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context). – Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters. – Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigation.</p>

How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?<br/>
How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?<br/>

do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially? How differ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Aim and scope</strong><br/>Aim and Scope – Be sure that your aim responds logically to the problem statement. – Stick rigorously to a single aim. Do not include elements in it that describe how you intend to achieve this aim; reserve these for a later chapter. – When you have written the conclusions to your whole study, check that they respond to this aim. If they don’t, change the aim or rethink your conclusions. – If you change the aim, revise the motivation for studying it. – Be sure to establish the scope of your study by identifying limitations of factors such as time, location, resources, or the established boundaries of particular fields or theories.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>publishers visible over authors</strong><br/>The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by “Great Britain”, and dwarfed again by the works by “null” authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>authors development = publisher choices</strong><br/>Radcliffe is remarkably stable in her choice of publisher<br/>
When Smith begins to branch out into more political radical works, she needs to branch out into new publishers as well<br/>
Robinson: ???<br/>
More accomplishes her stunning volume of work partly by being a publisher as much as she is an author. (See: The Apprentice’s Monitor) Her shifting publisher data is mostly information on the Cheap Repository Tracts. [But I was cautioned that these dates are less reliable! Ignore chronological information ov...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>prominence of the "back catalogue"</strong><br/>Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ch 4: Synthesis / Discussion</strong><br/> Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.<br/>
<br/>
Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ch 5: Conclusion</strong><br/>Connecting discussion and conclusions: • Your conclusions are what your discussion chapter has been arguing for. • You could write the conclusions to your whole study as the last section of a chapter called ‘Discussion and Conclusions’, but it is usually preferable to have a separate ‘Conclusions’ chapter. • If they form a separate chapter there should be no conclusions to the discussion chapter, and you should inform the reader of this in the discussion. Rules about conclusions: • You should draw your conclusions solely from the discussion chapter. • There should be little further discussion in the conclusions chapter. • The conclusions should respond to the aim stated in the first chapter. • Summaries are not conclusions. • Conclusions should be crisp and concise. • The conclusions can be used to briefly explore the implications of your findings.</p>

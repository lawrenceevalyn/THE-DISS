<p class="itemTitle">proposal intro</p>
<p class="itemText">My current thinking on my dissertation consists of a series of questions which are, ultimately, about the construction of written canons. As I pose these questions, I am concerned with some interrelated dichotomies which fall out of this larger question: popularity versus seriousness, timeliness versus timelessness and marginalization versus canonization. I want to ask how works that are now considered serious and timeless have achieved their prominent positions, and examine “unserious” or ephem...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">gillespie comment</p>
<p class="itemText">Is there a way in which this can be said to be, overall, about how texts do or don't 'enter' a 'canon' of writings - by which you mean, as per e.g. Guillory or Bourdieu, and the idea of cultural capital, a set of texts studied, produced, valued (to varying degrees over time) within certain cultural fields, most especially the field of academic research (but also education, modern publishing, creative industries etc). And then your contribution to the many discussions that go on about (and indeed...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">deleted ideas from ch 5</p>
<p class="itemText">brings together these lines of thought, to ask what relationship “serious literature” had to the “non-literary”, and especially to “sub-literary” fiction, in the 1790s. Does “serious” fiction use “genre” fiction parasitically or does it have its own separate genre norms?  When and why is timeliness seen as “unserious”? What makes writing “disreputable”? How do we read “disreputable” writing? This chapter engages most directly with the vexed roles and uses of the Gothic</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">intro - vocab</p>
<p class="itemText">My introduction will define the terms and concepts which the rest of the dissertation will use, paying particular attention to the parallel development of similar concerns in DH and non-DH fields. I will explicitly note that my DH methods align me with scholars in queer DH, and discuss some of the underlying assumptions of queer theory which shape my thinking: my aspiration is a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literatur...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 1 - what's not novels?</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter one takes up the eternal problem of archival gaps, and asks how we might interrogate or fill these gaps with computational methods. It asks how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 2 - fame and legacy</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “serious...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - lingering legacies</p>
<p class="itemText">Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 4 - chapbook sales</p>
<p class="itemText">My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see ho...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 5 - Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who acc...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">The dissertation as a whole, then, looks at the same large body of texts (works printed in England 1789-99) through several different, but interconnected, lenses. Only some of these lenses have specific computational projects in mind already, but all of them ask questions at a scale where I know I will want at least a spreadsheet, and quite probably much more, in order to bring together the many pieces of information that I examine. I expect some works and lines of thought to re-emerge in multip...</p>

<p class="itemText">TITLE:  Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Map of the thesis at this stage:</p>
<p class="itemText"> 1. Introduction: archive formation!</p>
<p class="itemText"> 2. Comparison of digital corpora (write this first)</p>
<p class="itemText"> 3. Ok, now how can I use these corpora to ask again what the print landscape of the 1790s actually looked like?</p>
<p class="itemText"> ⁃ Mainstream press?</p>
<p class="itemText"> ⁃ Radical press? Is it actually surreptitious/marginal?</p>

<p class="itemTitle">intro - archive formation</p>

<p class="itemText">All my terms (seriousness, timelessness, etc) are reasons a work might be canonized — clarifies my interests by ‘zooming out’ to the framework of the canon</p>
<p class="itemText">Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 1 - digital corpora</p>
<p class="itemText">Looking at digital corpora the way that people look at anthologies, classroom teaching, etc; talk about why it’s important to know this, becase this is what we all refer to now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 2 - mainstream press</p>
<p class="itemText">Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about cele...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - radical press</p>
<p class="itemText">Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publi...</p>

<p class="itemText">"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive.

<br/>
I’ve cut the “something something Arab orientalism” chapter for now because the really good stuff seems to come just after the end of my decade -- I’ll keep my eyes peeled, and might add it back in if I see somewhere that it belongs, but it doesn’t make sense to me as a chapter right now. Instead, I’ll keep brushing up on my Arabic, and start percolating ideas for the next project after this one.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>For The 18thC Experts</strong><br/>My current thinking on my dissertation consists of a series of questions, the answers to which I expect to be interrelated. As I pose these questions, my central concern is the distinction drawn between popularity/timeliness/marginalization and seriousness/timelessness/legacy. I want to ask how works that are now considered serious and timeless have achieved their prominent positions, and examine “unserious” or ephemeral works that reward further consideration.<br/>
Chapter one engages with a digital...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ch 1 - what's not novels?</strong><br/>Chapter one engages directly with a digital humanities problem, to ask how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begin with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of 18thC texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a disc...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ch 2 - fame and legacy</strong><br/>Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “serious...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ch 3 - lingering legacies</strong><br/>Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ch 4 - chapbook sales</strong><br/>My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see ho...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ch 5 - serious vs unserious fiction</strong><br/>My fifth chapter brings together these lines of thought, to ask what relationship “serious literature” had to the “non-literary”, and especially to “sub-literary” fiction, in the 1790s. Does “serious” fiction use “genre” fiction parasitically or does it have its own separate genre norms?  When and why is timeliness seen as “unserious”? What makes writing “disreputable”? How do we read “disreputable” writing? This chapter engages most directly with the vexed roles and uses of the Gothic: drawing ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>The dissertation as a whole, then, looks at the same large body of texts (works printed in England 1789-99) through several different, but interconnected, lenses. Only some of these lenses have specific computational projects in mind already, but all of them ask questions at a scale where I know I will want at least a spreadsheet, and quite probably much more, in order to bring together the many pieces of information that I examine. I expect some works and lines of thought to re-emerge in multip...</p>

Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts.

Clery tracks the rise of supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news, producing a history of the Gothic that is sensitive to its impact in varying literary contexts.

Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary context...</p>

Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature<br/>
To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two con...</p>

My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional respons...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sedgwick</strong><br/>Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Felski</strong><br/>Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>closeness / interest</strong><br/>Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistanc...</p>

My project is analogous to a scientific meta-analysis, comparing several major digital collections. I consider all works published in Britain between 1789 and 1799 across six digital archives.

<p class="itemTitle">proposal intro</p>
<p class="itemText">Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like, in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers, and how this print landscape persists in archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the exis...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 1 - intro</p>
<p class="itemText">My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. As this chapter will establish, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 2 - archives</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - archive popularity</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. After developing a few different metrics for popularity, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? Why does one corpus show one popular thing, and another show another? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the mos...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 4 - networks</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. [List some of it here! Include a brief lit review; address t...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 5 - networks popularity</p>
<p class="itemText">Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of radical and mainstream printing circles. </p>
<p class="itemText">My network graphs will model individual “politics” [as a complex, socially defined thing] rather than a set of concrete and unchanging ideological stances.  [By looking for clusters in the big hairball] I will Think about individual printers as having political allegiances (as in Dissenting societies, radica...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">coda? - gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production. (Assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) My previous work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Reparative Reading</p>
<p class="itemText">"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."</p>
<p class="itemText">"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been n...</p>

<p class="itemText">Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to ...</p>

<p class="itemText">My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives.

As this chapter will discuss, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are seeking to develop less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies. ...</p>

When eighteenth century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history began to be interpreted into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity.

After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their a...</p>

Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picar...</p>

<p class="itemText">Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">My dissertation seeks to determine, at as minute a level of detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like (in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers), and how this print landscape persists in archives.</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">outline</p>
<p class="itemText">My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the existing digital archives of the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade, with some discussion of celebrity as it manifests in print culture. Chapter four turns its attention to the radical press, and the social ties underlying radical writing and publishing. A potential fifth ch...</p>

<p class="itemText">Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 2 - mainstream press</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade.</p>
<p class="itemText">One thread of inquiry is simply to recover contemporary printing practices: who was printing what, and when? What role do chapbooks and religious tracts play? Do our archives simply replicate the output of the major publishing houses?</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - radical press</p>
<p class="itemText">My fourth chapter turns its attention to the radical press. It will use social network graphs of writers and printers to study the personal connections making up this underground print culture. (Look for political clusters in graphs, and printing circles / overlapping circles)</p>
<p class="itemText">Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having politi...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 5 - gothic?</p>
<p class="itemText">A potential fifth chapter could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production. (Assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) My previous work suggests that the Gothic, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. This chapter use a stylometric approach to computationally identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to quantify the reach of the Gothic a...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - archive popularity</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine celebrity via print culture. Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather that nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare how famous various literary celebrities were over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track promine...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 4 - networks</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices: who was printing what, and when?</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 5 - networks popularity</p>
<p class="itemText">Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them for their relation to our current understanding of radical and mainstream printing circles.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ch 6 - pop culture vs populism</p>
<p class="itemText">The final chapter would, in some fashion, draw together my overarching concern with print culture as a social activity. I will resist the impulse to discuss to take the Gothic as my main subject or the driving framework for an experiment (though I expect that the social nature of print will nonetheless include discussion of the Gothic). I think instead I might get at the two meanings of “popular”, that is, “pop culture” (mainstream) and “populist” (radical).</p>

<p class="itemText">"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."</p>

<p class="itemText">This dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like.

<p class="itemTitle">many definitions of DH</p>
<p class="itemText">The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological. [ADD A COUPLE DEFINITIONS OF DH HERE]. These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.” Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life. [ADD SOME DIGITAL CULTURAL ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">many histories of 1790s</p>
<p class="itemText">So, too, are there many “histories” — or perhaps, narratives — available to describe the 1790s. [FOCUS ON POLITICS]. [FOCUS ON ROMANTICISM]. [FOCUS ON GOTHIC]. [RISE OF THE NOVEL] Of necessity, each of these histories must exclude something. [WHAT EACH EXCLUDES].</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">reparative reading</p>
<p class="itemText">It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia. Eve Sedgwick persuasively describes, in “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading,” the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism \cite{Sedgwick:2015up}.

<p class="itemTitle">many histories of DH</p>
<p class="itemText">When telling a history of “DH,” one has many histories to choose from, all freighted with different implications for contemporary practice. [TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF DH]. [FEMINIST HISTORY OF DH.] As these competing historiographies show, much more is at stake than mere description, when certain methodologies are named as “digital humanities.” [CONCLUSION TO THIS PARAGRAPH.]</p>

<p class="itemTitle">code is not neutral</p>
<p class="itemText">The central contention of my computational praxis is that, despite the aura of empirical truth which accrues to some ‘scientific’ methodologies and discourses, nothing is neutral/objective. As Johanna Drucker argues, “data” is not neutral/objective. As Sophia Noble and Wendy Chun demonstrate, algorithms are not neutral/objective. As Alberto Cairo shows, graphs and charts are not neutral/objective. [PUT THESE IN ORDER ACCORDING TO FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS] Each of these is constructed, by humans, for...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">my methods</p>
<p class="itemText">This dissertation will, nonetheless, make use of algorithms, “data”, and data visualizations to carry out its inquiry. At every possible point, however, the underlying methodology will be made visible, and its assumptions scrutinized. Much of the code underlying this project I have written myself. Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A (“Codebase”), accompanied by a plain-language explanation of how it operat...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">capta</p>
<p class="itemText">My attention to the sources of digital knowledge creation comes from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” Drucker, in “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” specifically addresses the digital humanities practice of creating, and then close-reading, data visualizations. She argues that the tools for visual representation which may be effective in the sciences cannot be simply and uncritically transposed to humanistic subject matter. When an experiment is present...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">data viz</p>
<p class="itemText">Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. My design praxis is informed by the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments. Neither Tufte nor Cairo is a scholar of media studies; rather, they are professional practitioners of ‘data visualization’ who reflect critically on the assumptions of their work. Tufte’s work primarily st...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">fruitful models/samples</p>
<p class="itemText">In light of the challenges of “empiricism,” my goal in this dissertation is to produce a series of fruitful models. [Willard McCarty’s descriptive work on the concept of modelling VERBS modelling’s processes of abstraction. ][QUOTES FROM McCARTY] Another way of expressing this might be to borrow from the vocabulary of social science research: I would like to make discoveries about a “population” which is inaccessible to me, namely, “everything printed in England 1789-99.” Since I cannot access t...</p>

<p class="itemText">Not coincidentally, the 1790s are also a decade in which some literary “canons” begin to take form. John Guillory contends that the “canon debate” taking place during his moment of writing in 1993 “signifies nothing less than a crisis in the form of cultural capital we call ‘literature’” \cite{Guillory:1993ve p.viii}; the roots of this crisis lie two hundred years earlier, in the eighteenth century formation of a vernacular (rather than classical) literary canon, and in the 1790s “first crisis” ...</p>

<p class="itemText">My primary theoretical framework is that of reparative reading. My touchstones are two descriptions from Sedgwick’s original chapter, “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading”:  </p>
<p class="itemText">The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self. \cite{Sedgwick:2015up p.149}</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">queer theory</p>
<p class="itemText">Implicit in my prioritization of reparative reading is an affinity for queer theory more broadly. I take it as read, for example, that history consists of major discontinuities in cultural ontology and identity, as Foucault describes. I follow Judith Butler in understanding these historically-framed identities as being “performative,” actively re-created in conversation between self and others. (In my understanding of performative identity creation I also borrow from J.L. Austin, who is not typi...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">surface reading</p>
<p class="itemText">My search for other ways of relating to literature has also led me to emerging work under the umbrella of “surface reading”. “Surface reading” positions itself as an alternative to “symptomatic reading”; [RATHER THAN X, IT Y.] The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but also, I argue, overly simplistic: all paranoid reading is symptomatic, but not all symptomatic reading is paranoid. Reparative reading, as described by Sedgwick and potentially modelled by Felski, is still i...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">Surface reading and reparative meaning are not synonymous modes: Felski, at the forefront of reparative reading, explicitly distances herself from surface reading “I have no quarrel with interpretation, even though I favor description; nor am I drawn to a language of textual surfaces over depths” (CITE).</p>

<p class="itemTitle">DH & bibliography</p>
<p class="itemText">In the intersection of the digital humanities and eighteenth century studies, I turn to bibliography. If there is any research as magnificent in its ambition than The Dictionary of Old English, it is work like Garside & Raven’s The English Novel. This kind of work seeks to be both comprehensive and accurate.

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">scholarly archives</p>
<p class="itemText">Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scope. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. On the tip of anyone’s tongue, of course, is Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), containing over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799.

<p class="itemTitle">micro archives</p>
<p class="itemText">Smaller collections allow for more scholarly curation, but have corresponding limitations.

Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle, the Index to the Lady’s Magazine (1...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">mega archives</p>
<p class="itemText">The best known mega-archive is, of course, Google Books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly-accurate metadata collected about them. Books are sourced from libraries whose collections are being scanned in bulk, or are submitted directly by publishers or authors who are attracted by Google’s call to “Promote your bo...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">dramatic open</p>
<p class="itemText">According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this inflammatory claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny. In fact, by the metric of ‘unique entries in the ESTC database,’ the most popular author of the decade is by far Great Britain, followed by Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain, and King George III. Paine, More, Wesley and Shakespeare are only...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">dramatic goals</p>
<p class="itemText">Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. I focus specifically on writing printed in...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">1790s canon debate</p>
<p class="itemText">The problem of evaluating literature is not a new or a simple one. In the eighteenth century, the debate took the form of urgently needing to distinguish ‘trash’ from ‘treasure’. Michael Gamer, in Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation, highlights the role of the eighteenth-century reviewer as a crucial mediator between the writers and readers of books. Importantly, although the assessments take the form of reviews of individual works, Gamer also argues that the critic...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">1990s canon debate</p>
<p class="itemText">In other words, Gamer and Taylor both affirm the key conclusion of John Guillory’s Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation, that “in fact ‘aesthetic value’ is nothing more or other than cultural capital" (332). Guillory’s sociological history of literary canons is a well-established part of literary studies, which will take on new dimensions as I apply to to the current moment of digital databases. In the eighteenth century, he argues, the cultural capital of vernacular English...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">DH canon debate</p>
<p class="itemText">Perhaps indicating that Guillory was correct, twenty years later, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain” (Guillory 265), now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” (“Conjectures” 55) is the problem of conceiving of world literature, rather than the “canonical...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">what I'm doing here</p>
<p class="itemText">The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus is not without grounds. As this dissertation will explore in depth, challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new “great unread.” Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. For example, the Engli...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">reparative reading</p>
<p class="itemText">The theoretical frameworks of this dissertation are drawn from the fields of feminist DH and queer DH, and from non-DH schools of thought which seem to offer valuable tools. My core motivating framework, as I conceptualize my work, is that of reparative reading. Eve Sedgwick’s “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading” persuasively describes in the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism, and attempts to sketch an alternative in what she terms reparative reading. A paranoid rhetoric of exposu...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">felski, surface readers</p>
<p class="itemText">I have mentioned moving away from critique as well as from paranoia: in rethinking the role of critique, I draw upon the work of Rita Felski, and the theories of “surface reading” described by Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, and Heather Love. Felski, in her article “After Suspicion” and then further in her monograph The Limits of Critique, seeks to attend seriously to literary attachments, including our own attachments as critics. Felski’s approach to these attachments is essentially sociological, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">computation reveals assumptions</p>
<p class="itemText">Love’s later article, “Close Reading and Thin Description,” provides a more precise articulation of the kind of close reading that she calls for, in which an “exhaustive, fine-grained attention to phenomena” (404) enables “taking up the position of the device; by turning oneself into a camera, one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully” (407). Although Love is uninterested in “distant reading” as synonymous w...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">distant reading without Moretti</p>
<p class="itemText">To bring these principles into the field of Digital Humanities by way of an example, I want to offer an alternative geneaology for the practice of distant reading itself. Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernen provide a valuable history of Josephine Miles as the first ‘distant reader’. Miles’ history, briefly, is as follows:</p>
<p class="itemText">In the 1930s, as a graduate student at Berkeley, she completed her first distant reading project: an analysis of the adjectives favored by Romantic poets. In the 1940s, with the ...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">critical algorithm studies</p>
<p class="itemText">What’s crucial, to use computational reading reparatively, is to use it reflectively. The desirable kinds of computation which I describe above will not happen inevitably. Here I draw upon the rich body of work emerging in critical algorithm studies, which examines (and attempts to reform) the human elements of computational algorithms. Any methodology is, to a certain extent, an “algorithm,” in the loose definition of ‘a series of pre-defined steps to be carried out’. But computational algorith...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">reparative DH</p>
<p class="itemText">Critical algorithm studies is therefore a crucial background for my work — but “critical” is literally in the name of of the field, and I still seek to be post-critical and reparative. As I encounter the limitations of the various information and tools through which I attempt to understand the 1790s, my goal is to do something other than facilely observe that they are limited. Instead, I want to identify the best ways to continue building on their foundations. In a digital humanities context, a ...</p>

<p class="itemText">This dissertation undertakes computational distant reading. At every possible point, however, the underlying methodology will be made visible, and its assumptions scrutinized. The bibliographic histories of my multiple corpora are explicit objects of inquiry. Much of the code underlying this project I have written myself. Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A (“Codebase”), accompanied by a plain-language exp...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">capta</p>
<p class="itemText">My attention to the sources of digital knowledge creation comes, in part, from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” Drucker, in “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” specifically addresses the digital humanities practice of creating, and then close-reading, data visualizations. She argues that the tools for visual representation which may be effective in the sciences cannot be simply and uncritically transposed to humanistic subject matter. When an experiment ...</p>

<p class="itemText">Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. My design praxis is informed by the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments. Neither Tufte nor Cairo is a scholar of media studies; rather, they are professional practitioners of ‘data visualization’ who reflect critically on the assumptions of their work. Tufte’s work primarily st...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">fruitful models</p>
<p class="itemText">This dissertation understands archives, bibliographies, anthologies, and corpora to all be, variously, models of an imagined object of study. In the language of social science, these models might be described as ‘samples,’ which are intended to permit discoveries about an underlying ‘population’ by being ‘representative’ of that population’s features. Only the language and not the methods of social science need to be imported here, since it has long been ordinary practice in literary studies to ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">corpora as canons</p>
<p class="itemText">A core object of study for this dissertation, then, is the makeup and history of contemporary digital databases. Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes. I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg and HathiTrust. My examination of these six databases will, of neces...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">scholarly archives</p>
<p class="itemText">The first three databases I examine will be no surprise to eighteenth century scholars: ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP. Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), contains over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which 51,965 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 titles...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">micro archives</p>
<p class="itemText">Smaller collections allow for more scholarly curation, but have corresponding limitations. Whereas the ‘main players’ of the the mega-archives can be easily enumerated, these specialized collections are numerous. Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle (1,950 references to fiction in i...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Google Books</p>
<p class="itemText">Instead, I look at a set of larger archives of more contested “scholarly” status: Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. Google Books may be the most infamous database of books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly-accurate metadata collected about them. These rapidly-scanned books are prone to unpredictab...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">HathiTrust</p>
<p class="itemText">What makes Google Books of interest in the context of this dissertation is its relationship to HathiTrust, an increasingly popular resource for scholars. HathiTrust’s collection contains digitized content from “a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house member institution initiatives.” The “in-house member institutions” include one hundred and fifty-five universities, colleges, and consortia of universities. The aggregate scholarly authority of these in...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Gutenberg</p>
<p class="itemText">HathiTrust’s success in acquiring scholarly capital stands in interesting contrast with Project Gutenberg’s continued lack of cachet. Project Gutenberg is used in research with similar frequency to Google Books’ n-gram tool, but scholars often mention Project Gutenberg with a note of apology for not having found a better source. Its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its actual use and utility, likely, I argue, because its organizing principles are the ‘unserious’ ones of popularity ...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">As this brief survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no ‘perfect’ corpus for large-scale study of eighteenth-century texts.  Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; ...</p>

<p class="itemText">All of the computational work in this dissertation aims to identify, in as minute detail as possible, all works printed in England between January 1 1789 and December 31 1799. This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799. In England, these events caused strong and variously nationalist reactions in a country which had so recently lost its colonies in America and feare...</p>

<p class="itemText">To navigate the 1790s, I turn to four authors whose careers and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature. These authors are Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Ann Radcliffe. All four authors were highly productive in the 1790s, and all four had complex and contested literary legacies after the 1790s. As literary scholars re-assess ideas about literary seriousness, popularity, and women’s writing, our assessment of these authors has s...</p>

<p class="itemText">Chapter 2 of this dissertation examines the works of Charlotte Smith across several digital corpora. Charlotte Smith is selected as a writer who was productive in multiple genres, only some of which may end up represented in corpora. Charlotte Smith’s literary career began with the publication of her volume of poetry Elegiac Sonnets, in 1784. This work is the one upon which much of Smith’s fame and prestige rested in the eighteenth century. A second edition of Elegiac Sonnets rapidly followed th...</p>

<p class="itemText">Smith’s personal life sometimes overshadows this career. As her works often make clear to her readers, after a briefly comfortable youth as the daughter of a well-off country gentleman who lived beyond his means, she was married at age sixteen to Benjamin Smith, “son of a prosperous London merchant and owner of Barbados sugar cane plantations. The marriage was contracted hastily to remove her from her paternal home, now dominated by her new wealthy stepmother. Looking back in bitterness nearly f...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">scholarship</p>
<p class="itemText">Smith’s posthumous critical reception has undergone multiple shifts in appreciation and obscurity. Duckling’s study of her presence in anthologies indicates that shortly after her death in 1806, Smith was widely eulogized and anthologized, remembered and emulated as an important British poet. As the nineteenth century went on, poetesses began to be anthologized separately from poets, in collections with ambitions that were commercial rather than intellectual; Smith, too, “lost intellectual groun...</p>

I identify what subset of Smith’s works each corpus contains, as a concrete example to compare their holdings overall. Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets, for example, are not included in the ECCO-TCP corpus (which is the one most often used for text mining research) — only Celestina and The Emigrants are included. Why these two texts? And what text mining research based on ECCO-TCP might have foun...</p>

<p class="itemText">Chapter 3 of this dissertation examines the works of Mary Robinson across several digital corpora. Mary Robinson is selected as a contemporary of Charlotte Smith’s with remarkably similar patterns of publication, but remarkably different reception. Mary Robinson’s first literary foray was the volume Poems by Mrs. Robinson, published by C. Parker in 1775, shortly followed by the poem Elegiac verses to a young lady on the death of her brother. “Though Poems received little critical support, and ma...</p>

<p class="itemText">Mary Robinson’s early biography shares striking resonances with that of Charlotte Smith. Robinson was also married at the age of sixteen to a man who squandered his income. Robinson spent more than a year in King’s Bench debtors’ prison with her husband and infant daughter, from 1774 to 1775, from which she published her first volume of poetry. Rather than immediately taking up the mantle of a professional author, however, in 1776 she became an actress. As an actress, she met increasing success ...</p>

<p class="itemText">Robinson’s public stature fell sharply after her death. Behrendt’s comparison of posthumous reviews of Robinson’s work with reviews of Charlotte Smith’s work highlights the fact that “unlike Smith she was widely regarded as the instigator rather than the victim of her misfortunes” (192), due to the ‘immorality’ of her choices; as a result, her claims to sympathy and sensibility are dismissed by early nineteenth century reviewers. Behrendt argues that her “notorious public behaviour seems to have...</p>

Ann Radcliffe is selected as a contrasting model of popularity, as a famous and popular author with a relatively short list of publications in only one genre. Radcliffe is a particularly useful case study author to contest the relevance of “editions” as a marker of popularity: many of the later editions of her works had very large print runs, since the works were sure to sell, such that a decline i...</p>

<p class="itemText">Radcliffe’s biography, too, is short. Radcliffe never cultivated a public literary persona, which itself led to the development of a mythos of her seclusion. Almost all biographical information comes from Thomas Noon Talfourd’s 1826 “Memoir of Radcliffe,” written in close consultation with Ann Radcliffe’s husband William. Radcliffe kept extensive journals, which Talfourd occasionally extracts, but her manuscripts were all destroyed shortly after her death, with the exception of forty-two pages o...</p>

<p class="itemText">More’s biography differs strongly from Smith’s and Robinson’s in that she never married. Instead, much of More’s personal life centred around educational ventures. In 1758, when More was thirteen, her eldest sister Mary More opened a girls’ boarding school, which Hannah More would soon assist in running. In 1762, this school moved to larger premises. In 1767, More accepted a proposal of marriage from William Turner, though this did not end in marriage: “After a rather humiliating six-year courts...</p>

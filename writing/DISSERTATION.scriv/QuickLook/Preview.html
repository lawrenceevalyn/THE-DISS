<p class="itemText">This dissertation in concerned with the process by which texts do or don’t ‘enter’ into ‘canons’ of writings, particularly in the heightened political environment of England in the 1790s. In service of this goal, this dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like. It also seeks to explain, in equally minute detail, why this task of ‘objective’ historical recovery is, in fact, impossible. In the process, I show how ...</p>

Of course this inflammatory claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny.

<p class="itemText">The core object of study in this dissertation is the writing published in England between 1789 and 1799. I say “writing” and not “literature,” despite the fact that my central interest is literature, because I address works whose status as “literary” is contested. I also say “published” rather than “written,” because I address the “1790s-ness” of works written well before this decade, but which took on new and timely meanings when reprinted.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">many definitions of DH</p>
<p class="itemText">The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological. These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.” Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life. This kind of work is increasingly described as “digital cultural s...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">distant reading without Moretti</p>
<p class="itemText"> Often discussed as synonymous with “DH” is a set of practices described as “distant reading.” Distant reading is undergoing a shift away from its figurehead in Franco Moretti, who famously coined the original term \cite{Moretti:2000ul}. If we wish to think about distant reading without Moretti, Ted Underwood and Rachel Buurma both provide valuable histories. Ted Underwood’s “Genealogy of Distant Reading” presents a history of distant reading which is not for the most part centrally concerned wi...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">critiques of distant reading</p>
<p class="itemText">Lauren Klein’s paper at MLA 2018, “Distant Reading after Moretti,” in fact poses the turn away from Moretti as an urgent imperative: “what do we do about distant reading, now that we know that Franco Moretti, the man who coined the phrase ‘distant reading,’ and who remains its most famous exemplar, is among the men named as a result of the #MeToo movement” \cite{Klein:2018to}? Klein, drawing on Sara Ahmed’s observation that “sexual harassment is a structural, as well as personal problem,” draws ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">prescription</p>
<p class="itemText">Klein’s prescription for change is not dissimilar to Katherine Bode’s somewhat earlier call for “a new object for data-rich literary history” \cite{Bode:2017gb}. Klein calls for “more corpora—more accessible corpora—that perform the work of recovery or resistance” to allow research “beyond quote ‘representative’ samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole” \cite{Klein:2018to}. Klein also suggests a change in how models are for...</p>

She argues that the tools for visual representation which may be effective in the sciences cannot be simply and uncritically transposed to humanistic subject matter. When an experiment i...</p>

This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799. In England, these events caused strong and variously nationalist reactions in a country which had so recently lost its...</p>

These authors are Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Ann Radcliffe.

In 1774 she publishes her play The Inflexible Captive, which is produced in 1775 at the Theatre Royal in Bath. In 1776, she publishes Sir Eldred of the Bower and the Bleeding Rock. In 1777, she publishes her first conduct-book, Essays on Various Subjects, dedicated to the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu.

<p class="itemText">Much of More’s personal life centred around educational ventures. In 1758, when More was thirteen, her eldest sister Mary More opened a girls’ boarding school, which Hannah More would soon assist in running. In 1762, this school moved to larger premises. In 1767, More accepted a proposal of marriage from William Turner, though this did not end in marriage: “After a rather humiliating six-year courtship (during which the pending marriage was postponed three times by the gentleman), a settlement w...</p>

<p class="itemText">Charlotte Smith’s literary career began with the publication of her volume of poetry Elegiac Sonnets, in 1784. Six sonnets by Smith had appeared in periodicals in 1782 and 1784 prior to the publication of Elegiac Sonnets \cite{Roberts:2019ur}. The first edition (1784) contains sixteen sonnets: ten original sonnets, then “other essays” in the middle of the volume (a translated “Song.

Robinson spent more than a year in King’s Bench debtors’ prison with her husband and infant daughter, from 1774 to 1775, from which she published her first volume of poetry. Rather than immediately taking up the mantle of a professional author, however, in 1776 she became an actress. As an actress, she met increasing success ...</p>

In 1789, she publishes The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne. In 1790, A Sicilian Romance. In 1791, The Romance of the Forest, which captured the public’s attention and made her name.

<p class="itemText">The digital humanities and the eighteenth century are my primary subject matter, but I am also deliberately employing certain theoretical frameworks in my thinking. In the ‘venn diagram’ of three fields, the ‘queer theory’ circle is smaller, but no less important. My primary theoretical framework is that of reparative reading. Eve Sedgwick persuasively describes, in “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading,” the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism \cite{Sedgwick:2003up}, and attempts to ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">queer theory</p>
<p class="itemText">Implicit in my prioritization of reparative reading is an affinity for queer theory more broadly. I take it as read, for example, that history consists of major discontinuities in cultural ontology and identity, as Foucault describes. I follow Judith Butler in understanding these historically-framed identities as being “performative,” actively re-created in conversation between self and others. (In my understanding of performative identity creation I also borrow from J.L. Austin, who is not typi...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">not close reading</p>
<p class="itemText">Generosity is often assumed to be an affect which it is only possible to assume in conjunction with textual intimacy; that is to say, reparative reading is often assumed to entail close reading. However, I contend that generosity can occur at any scale. Rita Felski provides valuable theoretical insight for reparative readers who do not wish to be (only) close readers. Felski, in her article “After Suspicion” and then further in her monograph The Limits of Critique, frames the core question anima...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">surface reading</p>
<p class="itemText">My search for other ways of relating to literature has also led me to emerging work under the umbrella of “surface reading”. “Surface reading” positions itself as an alternative to “symptomatic reading”; rather than seeking to expose hidden truths concealed within texts, it attempts accurate descriptions that “make visible what is invisible only because it's too much on the surface of things” \cite{Best:2016ve p.13}. The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but not perfect: ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">By marrying “surface reading” and “distant reading” I may seem to leave “reparative reading” behind: after all, Felski’s call for postcritical analysis explicitly suggests, “Sometimes serious thinking calls for a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance” (CITE). However, Felski then defines a decrease of distance as “a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments”: this, I insist, can be done at any scale.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">history of the novel</p>
<p class="itemText">Both during the eighteenth century and in subsequent critical reception, the literature of the 1790s seemed to present a queer problem: what are we to make of the Gothic? After discussing some histories of the eighteenth century novel both excluding and including the Gothic as a general category, I will turn to the specific cases of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis to discuss the queerness of these debates about literature and genre.</p>

He argues that although eighteenth-century critics sought to make distinctions in the social value of different plays, or different parts of the theatrical program a...</p>

<p class="itemText">Suarez: “Lacking the resources to conduct a detailed analysis of the entire ESTC from 1701 to 1800, I have resorted to sampling. Electing to examine all eighteenth-century records that appear in years ending in three – 1703, 1713, 1723 and so on – I have sought to avoid a number of cohort effects, most especially the cumulation of indeterminate records into years ending in ‘0’ or ‘1’ and, to a lesser degree, ‘5’.” (41)</p>

Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their a...</p>

Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picar...</p>

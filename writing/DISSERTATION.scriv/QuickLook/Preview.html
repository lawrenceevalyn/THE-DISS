<p class="binderItem"><strong>background</strong><br/>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>driving research Qs</strong><br/>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>critical context</strong><br/>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much bro...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>methods</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>model 1: ESTC</strong><br/>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and majo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>model 2: ECCO-TCP</strong><br/>I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the Un...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>model 3: reading</strong><br/>Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositori...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>conclusion</strong><br/>Although I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will research them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be...</p>

One snippet per “thought.”<br/>
Let it all accumulate into groupings organically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what to do with so much lit?</strong><br/>My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how to select texts?</strong><br/>How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what do we teach? in what context?</strong><br/>What texts should we teach to students? And how should we contextualize them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how to identify genres?</strong><br/>How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do literary fads move?</strong><br/>do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do audiences differ?</strong><br/>How different are the writers and audiences for each medium?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what is "normal" in the 1790s?</strong><br/>What do my corpora tell us about what was ‘normal’ during my decade?<br/>
What does it mean to be “normal” or to seek the “normal” over the exceptional?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do we account for variety?</strong><br/>One of the things I like about computational methods is that, ultimately, there are no glossy simplifications — one must touch and somehow *account for* the things that don’t fit the pattern</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how political is 1790s lit?</strong><br/>I also anticipate finding new insight into the forms and popularity of political writing in the period: how much of the work being consumed is presented with explicit political aims?</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what genres for what politics?</strong><br/>What mediums are most-used for different political positions?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>author case studies</strong><br/>In a somewhat separate line of inquiry, I will explore in-depth the works of the individuals authors under consideration: how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do they use genre?</strong><br/>how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>are they "representative"?</strong><br/>Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my key writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers?</p>

</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>"genres are problem-solving devices"</strong><br/>What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (Moretti Distant Reading 141)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what to teach: convo with Jack</strong><br/>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:<br/>
<br/>
1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ballads make ideas catchy</strong><br/>Jo Walton’s “single most quoted thing I have ever written” is a song “The Lurkers Support Me In Email” to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over The Ocean” — because the tune makes the words more memorable, so if the idea itself sticks with you you now have a pre-packaged way to share it<br/>
JUST LIKE what Hannah More does when she publishes hymns / the entire song market of the 18thC!! </p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>crying in jails</strong><br/>Is the stock sentimental trope of crying in a jail marked by continuity or discontinuity in its meaning, during the French Revolution?<br/>
[Crying in a jail means something different before and after the Revolution; the uses of emotion gain new possible powers] [So these same sentiments gain new importance and need a new name, the Gothic, when they collide with political realities]</p>

I cannot forget, said he, that the most dissolute of these men is still my fellow-creature. The same GOD made them; the same SAVIOUR died for them; how then can I hate the worst of them?

<p class="binderItem"><strong>performative vulnerability</strong><br/>What other ways could I examine performative vulnerability as a social strategy for women?</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men are easily manipulated</strong><br/>Men are easily manipulated because they position of power makes it unecessary for them to adeptly perceive situations; they have the privilege of not really seeing the suffering they cause</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's vulnerability demands intervention</strong><br/>Women’s ostentatious vulnerability demands male intervention — if women can manage to be sufficiently vulnerable in front of the right men, they can reach their desired end states<br/>
(It creates a vacuum)</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC: publishers visible over authors</strong><br/>The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by “Great Britain”, and dwarfed again by the works by “null” authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC: author development = publisher choice</strong><br/>Radcliffe is remarkably stable in her choice of publisher<br/>
When Smith begins to branch out into more political radical works, she needs to branch out into new publishers as well<br/>
Robinson: ???<br/>
More accomplishes her stunning volume of work partly by being a publisher as much as she is an author. (See: The Apprentice’s Monitor) Her shifting publisher data is mostly information on the Cheap Repository Tracts. [But I was cautioned that these dates are less reliable! Ignore chronological information ov...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC: prominence of the "back catalogue"</strong><br/>Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>canonical authors aren't obviously exceptional</strong><br/>"rivals: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (Moretti Distant Reading 67)<br/>
There are so many of them and they look at first glance so similar<br/>
(Even for, like, modernism….? Or Romanticism, that first round of glorification of individual genius?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>always expect power-law distribution</strong><br/>“Ha-ha! No one expects the power-law distribution!”<br/>
We want things to be a few, simple, balanced categories — we especially want there to be two equally-matched sides of a binary — but in fact just about everything follows a power-law distribution, which will necessitate a long-tail “misc” category.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>"thinking other than dualistically"</strong><br/>Sedgwick’s project in Thinking Feeling was “the ambition of thinking other than dualistically” (p.1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>18thC titles intentionally signal contents</strong><br/>The title of a work was the main ‘advertisement’ available to a text (even author names played a minor role!) so 18thC titles are doing a lot of heavy linguistic signalling of the contents intentionally to locate/interpellate their audiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>reparative reading</strong><br/>"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."<br/>
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been n...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>DH: thing you study is a thing you create</strong><br/>You make/remake the object of your inquiry according to your own interests, priorities, lens, whims — you nurture it, claim it, become intimate with it by manipulating it (deformance), using it, getting messy and tangled and confused with it.<br/>

The decade 1789-99 is suddenly *about me*, and *mine*.</p>

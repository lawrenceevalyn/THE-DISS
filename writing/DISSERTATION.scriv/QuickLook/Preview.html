<li>
<p class="itemTitle">proposal intro</p>
<p class="itemText">My current thinking on my dissertation consists of a series of questions which are, ultimately, about the construction of written canons. As I pose these questions, I am concerned with some interrelated dichotomies which fall out of this larger question: popularity versus seriousness, timeliness versus timelessness and marginalization versus canonization. I want to ask how works that are now considered serious and timeless have achieved their prominent positions, and examine “unserious” or ephem...</p>

<p class="itemText">brings together these lines of thought, to ask what relationship “serious literature” had to the “non-literary”, and especially to “sub-literary” fiction, in the 1790s. Does “serious” fiction use “genre” fiction parasitically or does it have its own separate genre norms?  When and why is timeliness seen as “unserious”? What makes writing “disreputable”? How do we read “disreputable” writing? This chapter engages most directly with the vexed roles and uses of the Gothic</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">intro - vocab</p>
<p class="itemText">My introduction will define the terms and concepts which the rest of the dissertation will use, paying particular attention to the parallel development of similar concerns in DH and non-DH fields. I will explicitly note that my DH methods align me with scholars in queer DH, and discuss some of the underlying assumptions of queer theory which shape my thinking: my aspiration is a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literatur...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 1 - what's not novels?</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter one takes up the eternal problem of archival gaps, and asks how we might interrogate or fill these gaps with computational methods. It asks how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 2 - fame and legacy</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “serious...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - lingering legacies</p>
<p class="itemText">Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 4 - chapbook sales</p>
<p class="itemText">My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see ho...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 5 - Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who acc...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">The dissertation as a whole, then, looks at the same large body of texts (works printed in England 1789-99) through several different, but interconnected, lenses. Only some of these lenses have specific computational projects in mind already, but all of them ask questions at a scale where I know I will want at least a spreadsheet, and quite probably much more, in order to bring together the many pieces of information that I examine. I expect some works and lines of thought to re-emerge in multip...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">intro</p>
<p class="itemText">I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.</p>

<p class="itemText">My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline. I pursue answers to literary questions via a range of methods, some of which will employ databases, [other things]. However, [rather than focusing on the digitality of my tools], I emphasize the continuity of my approach with, for example, the exhaustive descriptive bibliography of Garside and the empirical quantificaion of St Clair.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">false empiricism only affects humanists</p>
<p class="itemText">Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, research in other fields is hard even to identify *as* research. These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.</p>

However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms.

<p class="itemTitle">More vs Wordsworth</p>
<p class="itemText">A central tension for me is the sense that Hannah More and William Wordsworth are both falling into similar traps of aestheticizing and moralizing their disdain for the very real distress for those in poverty, and that I nonetheless find Shepherd of Salisbury Plain more palatable than Michael. Michael in its beauties disguises its operations; More is so transparent that it’s easy to simply set aside what is unpalatable and read for the other details.</p>

This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perha...</p>

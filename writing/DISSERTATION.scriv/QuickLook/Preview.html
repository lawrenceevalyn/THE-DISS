<p class="itemTitle">many definitions of DH</p>
<p class="itemText">The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist.

<p class="itemText">When telling a history of “DH,” one has many histories to choose from, all freighted with different implications for contemporary practice. [TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF DH].

<p class="itemTitle">code is not neutral</p>
<p class="itemText">The central contention of my computational praxis is that, despite the aura of empirical truth which accrues to some ‘scientific’ methodologies and discourses, nothing is neutral/objective. As Johanna Drucker argues, “data” is not neutral/objective. As Sophia Noble demonstrates, algorithms are not neutral/objective. As Wendy Chun reveals, computational technologies are not neutral/objective. As Alberto Cairo shows, graphs and charts are not neutral/objective. [FIND SOMEBODY TO SHOW THAT TOOLS LI...</p>

Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A, accompanied by a plain-language explanation of how it oper...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">capta</p>
<p class="itemText">My attention to the sources of digital knowledge creation comes from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” [EXTENDED SUMMARY OF DRUCKER.]  [records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, captured, rather than neutrally “given.”] [EXAMPLE DATA FROM MY MATERIALS] [Conclusion: ??]</p>

<p class="itemTitle">critical algorithm studies</p>
<p class="itemText">If, as Drucker establishes, “data analysis” is already doomed to [MESSINESS?] from the moment of data capture, [SOMEHOW ALSO TRANSITION TO THE ALGORITHMS MAKE USE OF THAT DATA.] The emerging field of critical algorithm studies thus responds to an urgent need.

<p class="itemTitle">fruitful models/samples</p>
<p class="itemText">In light of the challenges of “empiricism,” my goal in this dissertation is to produce a series of fruitful models. [Willard McCarty on models] Another way of expressing this might be to borrow from the vocabulary of social science research: I would like to make discoveries about a “population” which is inaccessible to me, namely, “everything printed in England 1789-99.” Since I cannot access this population in full, I have taken a series of “samples,” which I hope to be representative; each sam...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">women's archives</p>
<p class="itemText">I make an exception for archives which specifically seek to address gaps in archival holdings due to systemic bias, that is, three archives focused on women’s writing: Orlando, Chawton, and [I thought there was a third one].</p>
<p class="itemText">For the most part archives are either comprehensive and have significantly more than 100 texts, or they are single-author / single-researcher focused, and thus have significantly less than 100. These kinds of reparative projects occupy the middle space.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">these are all databases</p>
<p class="itemText">The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for uni...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">so what?</p>
<p class="itemText">These basic factual questions, about what is in the various eighteenth century digital corpora that represent “mass” 18thC holdings for scholars, matter because []. Even though the specific numbers are likely to change as these digital holdings are continuously updated, my investigation of an archive “snapshot” matters because [they show how questions of fact can (and cannot) be answered?]</p>

<p class="itemText">As I expand to algorithmically examine the full corpora, I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words “Xth edition.”</p>

Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picar...</p>

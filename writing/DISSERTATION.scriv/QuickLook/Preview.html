<p class="itemText">According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny.

<p class="itemText">Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus.

<p class="itemTitle">1790s canon debate</p>
<p class="itemText">The problem of evaluating literature is not a new or a simple one. In the eighteenth century, the debate took the form of urgently needing to distinguish ‘trash’ from ‘treasure’. Michael Gamer, in Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation, highlights the role of the eighteenth-century reviewer as a crucial mediator between the writers and readers of books. Importantly, although the assessments take the form of reviews of individual works, Gamer also argues that the critic...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">1990s canon debate</p>
<p class="itemText">In other words, Gamer and Taylor both affirm the key conclusion of John Guillory’s Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation, that “in fact ‘aesthetic value’ is nothing more or other than cultural capital” (332). Guillory’s sociological history of literary canons is a well established part of literary studies, which will take on new dimensions as I apply it to the current moment of digital databases. In the eighteenth century, he argues, the cultural capital of vernacular English...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">DH canon debate</p>
<p class="itemText">Perhaps indicating that Guillory was correct, twenty years later, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain” (Guillory 265), now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” (“Conjectures” 55) is the problem of conceiving of world literature, rather than the “canonical...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">what I'm doing here</p>
<p class="itemText">The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus is not without grounds. As this dissertation will explore in depth, challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new “great unread.” Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. For example, the Engli...</p>

<p class="itemText">My work takes a critical algorithm studies approach to digital databases of eighteenth-century literature, examining the structural assumptions of the most-used resources (including some that scholars don’t like to admit to using). I close read the database structures, file formats, and historical documentation for the English Short Title Catalogue, Eighteenth Century Collections Online, the Text Creation Partnership, HathiTrust, Project Gutenberg, and Google Books, to examine how each resource’...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">reparative reading</p>
<p class="itemText">The theoretical frameworks of this dissertation are drawn from the fields of feminist DH and queer DH, and from non-DH schools of thought which seem to offer valuable tools. My core motivating framework, as I conceptualize my work, is that of reparative reading. Eve Sedgwick’s “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading” persuasively describes in the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism, and attempts to sketch an alternative in what she terms reparative reading. A paranoid rhetoric of exposu...</p>

<p class="itemText">I have mentioned moving away from critique as well as from paranoia: in rethinking the role of critique, I draw upon the work of Rita Felski, and the theories of “surface reading” described by Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, and Heather Love. Felski, in her article “After Suspicion” and then further in her monograph The Limits of Critique, seeks to attend seriously to literary attachments, including our own attachments as critics.

<p class="itemText">Love’s later article, “Close Reading and Thin Description,” provides a more precise articulation of the kind of close reading that she calls for, in which an “exhaustive, fine-grained attention to phenomena” (404) enables “taking up the position of the device; by turning oneself into a camera, one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully” (407).

<p class="itemTitle">distant reading without Moretti</p>
<p class="itemText">To bring these principles into the field of Digital Humanities by way of an example, I want to offer an alternative geneaology for the practice of distant reading itself. Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernen provide a valuable history of Josephine Miles as the first ‘distant reader’. Miles’ history, briefly, is as follows:</p>

<p class="itemTitle">critical algorithm studies</p>
<p class="itemText">What’s crucial, to use computational reading reparatively, is to use it reflectively. The desirable kinds of computation which I describe above will not happen inevitably. Here I draw upon the rich body of work emerging in critical algorithm studies, which examines (and attempts to reform) the human elements of computational algorithms. Any methodology is, to a certain extent, an “algorithm,” in the loose definition of ‘a series of pre-defined steps to be carried out’. But computational algorith...</p>

<p class="itemText">Critical algorithm studies is therefore a crucial background for my work — but “critical” is literally in the name of of the field, and I still seek to be post-critical and reparative. As I encounter the limitations of the various information and tools through which I attempt to understand the 1790s, my goal is to do something other than facilely observe that they are limited. Instead, I want to identify the best ways to continue building on their foundations. In a digital humanities context, a ...</p>

This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799.

I also knew that for many of the databases I wanted to use, I would not be able to access their full records, but samples of up to roughly 50,000 records had been given to other scholars (based on other papers I saw people publish on the ESTC).

<p class="itemTitle">intro</p>
<p class="itemText">To navigate the 1790s, I turn to an author whose career and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature: Charlotte Smith. Smith was highly productive in multiple genres throughout the 1790s, and had a complex and contested literary legacy after the 1790s. As literary scholars re-assess ideas about literary seriousness, popularity, and women’s writing, our assessment of Smith has shifted as well. By examining their bibliographies with computational me...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">why CSmith?</p>
<p class="itemText">In addition to being a prolific and interesting writing who was prominent across multiple genres (of which there are many other authors), Charlotte Smith offers an interesting case study in a ‘successful’ recovery project. This allows me to ask: to what extent do research infrastructures ‘lag behind’ scholarly consensus? No eighteenth centuryist is now likely to say that Smith is irrelevant or unimportant to the period. In the infrastructure of literary canons as described by Guillory, she has c...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">the genre thing</p>
<p class="itemText">Smith is also self-consciously navigating a series of questions about genre that interest me, namely, the fact that not everybody reads everything, or for the same reasons — she is not the same author from genre to genre.</p>
<p class="itemText">“Very few Smith scholars work actively on both the novels and the poetry, and consequently we have been learning about two separate Smiths, each closely linked to the genre she writes in, neither closely linked to the other. Because the novel during the Romantic period is under...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">writing</p>
<p class="itemText">Charlotte Smith is selected as a writer who was productive in multiple genres, only some of which may end up represented in corpora. Charlotte Smith’s literary career began with the publication of her volume of poetry Elegiac Sonnets, in 1784. This work is the one upon which much of Smith’s fame and prestige rested in the eighteenth century. A second edition of Elegiac Sonnets rapidly followed the first in the same year, with only slight amendments. The third and fourth editions of Elegiac Sonne...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">life</p>
<p class="itemText">Smith’s personal life sometimes overshadows this career. As her works often make clear to her readers, after a briefly comfortable youth as the daughter of a well-off country gentleman who lived beyond his means, she was married at age sixteen to Benjamin Smith, “son of a prosperous London merchant and owner of Barbados sugar cane plantations. The marriage was contracted hastily to remove her from her paternal home, now dominated by her new wealthy stepmother. Looking back in bitterness nearly f...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">scholarship</p>
<p class="itemText">Smith’s posthumous critical reception has undergone multiple shifts in appreciation and obscurity. Duckling’s study of her presence in anthologies indicates that shortly after her death in 1806, Smith was widely eulogized and anthologized, remembered and emulated as an important British poet. As the nineteenth century went on, poetesses began to be anthologized separately from poets, in collections with ambitions that were commercial rather than intellectual; Smith, too, “lost intellectual groun...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">intro</p>
<p class="itemText">A core object of study for this dissertation is the makeup and history of contemporary digital databases. Eighteenth-century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes. I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg and HathiTrust. My examination of these six databases will, of necessity, e...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">scholarly archives</p>
<p class="itemText">The first three databases I examine will be no surprise to eighteenth-century scholars: ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP. Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), contains over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which 51,965 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 titles...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">micro archives</p>
<p class="itemText">Smaller collections allow for more scholarly curation, but have corresponding limitations. Whereas the ‘main players’ of the the mega-archives can be easily enumerated, these specialized collections are numerous. Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle (1,950 references to fiction in i...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Google Books</p>
<p class="itemText">Instead, I look at a set of larger archives of more contested “scholarly” status: Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. Google Books may be the most infamous database of books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly accurate metadata collected about them. These rapidly scanned books are prone to unpredictab...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Project Gutenberg</p>
<p class="itemText">Also in the category of smaller and specialized archives is Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly work — its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its use and utility. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard, ‘unscholarly’ source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public d...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">HathiTrust</p>
<p class="itemText">What makes Google Books of interest in the context of this dissertation is its relationship to HathiTrust, an increasingly popular resource for scholars. HathiTrust’s collection contains digitized content from “a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house member institution initiatives.” The “in-house member institutions” include one hundred and fifty-five universities, colleges, and consortia of universities. The aggregate scholarly authority of these in...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Gutenberg</p>
<p class="itemText">HathiTrust’s success in acquiring scholarly capital stands in interesting contrast with Project Gutenberg’s continued lack of cachet. Project Gutenberg is used in research with similar frequency to Google Books’ n-gram tool, but scholars often mention Project Gutenberg with a note of apology for not having found a better source. Its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its actual use and utility, likely, I argue, because its organizing principles are the ‘unserious’ ones of popularity ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">As this brief survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no ‘perfect’ corpus for large scale study of eighteenth-century texts.  Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; ...</p>

<p class="itemTextStart">Women made up a nearly negligible portion of the titles published in England during the 1790s. If one were to choose a title at random, it would be more likely to be written by a man named John than by a woman. But we do not choose titles at random— even in large-scale digital humanities research. We neglect the genres from which women are most strongly excluded: medical texts, legal texts, sermons, and other discourses tied to specialized (male) occupations. We prefer fiction and poetry, the fo...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">what's my goal??</p>
<p class="itemText">This dissertation has been centrally concerned with textual selection. In this final chapter, I wish to experiment with a perverse and speculative form of textual selection: true randomness. The value of speculative computing, as a methodology in a liminal space between the humanities and computer science, lies in its ability to be useless in a thought-provoking way. Of course one would not seriously suggest that we study literary history through texts chosen at random… but what would happen if ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">implications</p>
<p class="itemText">The perversity of this method might seem like a bad-faith interpretation of literary studies, or an attempt to debunk or hoax literature scholarship. If scholars expend considerable expertise in order to select specific illustrative texts to support their arguments about a period of literature, why should it “work” to skip that expertise? If I produce an analysis from random texts, doesn’t that mean that other scholars’ choices of texts don’t matter? But I do this experiment in part to understan...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">love</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the pleasurable impulses that drives literary-historical research is the feeling that one’s explorations are special. Often it can seem as if you are the first person to read, or to care about, a text or a person in hundreds of years. That intimacy across time gains its sacred aura in part from its exclusivity; to love Jane Austen has a very different tenor than if one loves Charlotte Smith, or loves Susannah Goodall. Sharing one’s discoveries is a double-edged sword: love asks to be shar...</p>

<p class="itemText">In earlier chapters, especially chapter 1, the 1790s provided a backdrop to explore my real subject of contemporary literary databases. In this chapter, however, my real subject is 1790s print culture in England; I am curious about how this subject might be illuminated differently through my unusual sampling method (in the vein of speculative computing) but several of my sampling principles are defined around the goal of actually acquiring sufficient titles to answer my questions. First, for exa...</p>

<p class="itemText">To take my sample, I used my “ESTC records - cleaned” spreadsheet from OpenRefine, which included 51,090 rows of data.

I created a column called “Random number,” using the function randomNumber(0, 51090) (per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46063173/how-to-make-a-random-sample-in-openrefine).

<p class="itemText">“The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,” especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). “Panizzis ‘Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be conv...</p>

<p class="itemText">‘The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records—for example, everything from 1720—there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720” (Karian 291)</p>

<p class="itemTitle">estc comment</p>
<p class="itemText">As Suarez notes, the ESTC is a unique resource for pre-19thC works: “Regrettably, although this volume of The Cambridge history of the book in Britain ends in 1830, it is not possible to perform a similarly comprehensive analysis for the first decades of the nineteenth century because we have no equivalent bibliographical control for this period” (Suarez 40).</p>

<p class="itemTitle">ESTC > ECCO</p>
<p class="itemText">“To use a metaphor, some people prefer to explore the world through books of photographs with occasional schematic maps. ESTC, on the other hand, provides the equivalent of a detailed topographic map, but no pictures. Such technical tools have limited appeal, even to some specialists; but if you want to thoroughly learn the lie of the land, you will need one, and the more complete and accurate the better.” (Tabor)</p>

<p class="itemText">“An increasingly common trend, I am sorry to report, is that more and more people do not want ESTC at all — they want ECCO or EEBO. The younger generation of scholars in particular, lured by full-text images and ransacking the Web for illustrations for their books and articles, are using these utilities as de facto bibliographic databases. They find that the stripped-down records and simplified indexes are good enough for their purposes. To a minority of them, the fact that other works, editions...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Bullard on ESTC</p>
<p class="itemText">The story of ESTC is one in which a closed ideal of authoritativeness is being relinquished slowly for the sake of more useful and modern qualities: evolution, accuracy, and depth. The printed versions of STC and Wing presented themselves as definitive bibliographies of English printing for the periods that they covered. Being native to the digital medium, by contrast, the nature of ESTC is that it is always a work in progress. What David McKitterick calls the ‘dispersed authority’ of the ESTC i...</p>

<p class="itemText">I created a “content set” called ECCO-1798 in Gale Digital Scholar Labs, by searching for all works in ECCO published “between” 1798 and 1798. This located 4,158 records. I downloaded the metadata for these 4,158 records as a CSV. I then used random.org’s “Random Integer Generator” to generate ten integers from 1 to 4,158 (inclusive), resulting in the following numbers: 1792, 2365, 159, 3511, 919, 170, 2136, 2259, 190, and 2242.

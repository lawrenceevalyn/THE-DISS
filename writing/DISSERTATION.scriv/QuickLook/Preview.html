<p class="itemText">Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">My dissertation seeks to determine, at as minute a level of detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like (in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers), and how this print landscape persists in archives. As I investigate, I am concerned with some interrelated dichotomies which fall out of my larger concern: popularity versus s...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">outline</p>
<p class="itemText">My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the existing digital archives of the 1790s.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">intro - archive formation</p>
<p class="itemText">My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade.</p>
<p class="itemText">My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, I wil...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 1 - digital corpora</p>
<p class="itemText">Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.</p>
<p class="itemText"> The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass h...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 2 - mainstream press</p>
<p class="itemText">Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about cele...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">ch 3 - radical press</p>
<p class="itemText">Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">The dissertation as a whole, then, looks at the same large body of texts (works printed in England 1789-99) through several different, but interconnected, lenses. Only some of these lenses have specific computational projects in mind already, but all of them ask questions at a scale where I know I will want at least a spreadsheet, and quite probably much more, in order to bring together the many pieces of information that I examine. I expect some works and lines of thought to re-emerge in multip...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Reparative Reading</p>
<p class="itemText">"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."</p>
<p class="itemText">"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been n...</p>

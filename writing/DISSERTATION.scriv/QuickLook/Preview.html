</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what to do with so much lit?</strong><br/>My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?</p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>what do we teach? in what context?</strong><br/>What texts should we teach to students? And how should we contextualize them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how to identify genres?</strong><br/>How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?</p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do audiences differ?</strong><br/>How different are the writers and audiences for each medium?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what is "normal" in the 1790s?</strong><br/>What do my corpora tell us about what was ‘normal’ during my decade?<br/>
What does it mean to be “normal” or to seek the “normal” over the exceptional?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do we account for variety?</strong><br/>One of the things I like about computational methods is that, ultimately, there are no glossy simplifications — one must touch and somehow *account for* the things that don’t fit the pattern</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>"genres are problem-solving devices"</strong><br/>What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (Moretti Distant Reading 141)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>there is no "quintessential" genre example</strong><br/>I’ve been looking, but I haven’t been able to find anything that ONLY replicated one genre’s set of tropes without including anything a bit original or incongruous; similarly no one work is able to contain ALL generic tropes. There is no “typical” Gothic novel </p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Genre is like Aristotelian species?</strong><br/>Genre operates like Aristotelian species, where we see individual examples and mentally combine them into a created “ideal” or perhaps placeholder? (Does this have… useful implications? Does Cai have anything to say about this?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>1820s parody gothics are gothic</strong><br/>The second flourishing of the Gothic in the 1820s as parody, meaningfully is Gothic.</p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Gothic checklists have no referents</strong><br/>Checklists of Gothic tropes functioned as successful pointers, despite the fact that no one work completed all the checklist items.</p>

</ul>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what to teach: convo with Jack</strong><br/>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:<br/>
<br/>
1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."<br/>
<br/>
1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poor...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ballads make ideas catchy</strong><br/>Jo Walton’s “single most quoted thing I have ever written” is a song “The Lurkers Support Me In Email” to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over The Ocean” — because the tune makes the words more memorable, so if the idea itself sticks with you you now have a pre-packaged way to share it<br/>
JUST LIKE what Hannah More does when she publishes hymns / the entire song market of the 18thC!! </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>crying in jails</strong><br/>Is the stock sentimental trope of crying in a jail marked by continuity or discontinuity in its meaning, during the French Revolution?<br/>
[Crying in a jail means something different before and after the Revolution; the uses of emotion gain new possible powers] [So these same sentiments gain new importance and need a new name, the Gothic, when they collide with political realities]</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's vulnerability demands intervention</strong><br/>Women’s ostentatious vulnerability demands male intervention — if women can manage to be sufficiently vulnerable in front of the right men, they can reach their desired end states<br/>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC: publishers visible over authors</strong><br/>The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by “Great Britain”, and dwarfed again by the works by “null” authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.</p>

Ignore chronological information ov...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ESTC: prominence of the "back catalogue"</strong><br/>Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>canonical authors aren't obviously exceptional</strong><br/>"rivals: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (Moretti Distant Reading 67)<br/>
There are so many of them and they look at first glance so similar<br/>
(Even for, like, modernism….? Or Romanticism, that first round of glorification of individual genius?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>always expect power-law distribution</strong><br/>“Ha-ha! No one expects the power-law distribution!”<br/>
We want things to be a few, simple, balanced categories — we especially want there to be two equally-matched sides of a binary — but in fact just about everything follows a power-law distribution, which will necessitate a long-tail “misc” category.</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>18thC titles intentionally signal contents</strong><br/>The title of a work was the main ‘advertisement’ available to a text (even author names played a minor role!) so 18thC titles are doing a lot of heavy linguistic signalling of the contents intentionally to locate/interpellate their audiences</p>

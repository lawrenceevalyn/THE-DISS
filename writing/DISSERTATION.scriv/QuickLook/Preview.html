<p class="binderItem"><strong>Proposal</strong><br/>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as contemporary writers anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. With more writers and more readers entering the conversation, it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a ‘whole.’ My MA research sought to contextualize the Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe in terms of the masses of their now-forgotten peers on the shelves ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Chapter 1: Introduction</strong><br/>An Introductory Chapter – Tell the reader the problem you are tackling in this project. – State clearly how you aim to deal with this problem. – Limit the scope of your study. – Sketch out how the thesis is structured to achieve your aim.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Context</strong><br/>Context of the Study – Provide a brief history of the issues to date. – Situate your particular topic within the broad area of research. – Note that the field is changing, and more research is required on your topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Problem statement</strong><br/> Problem Statement (or Motivation for the Study) – Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context). – Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters. – Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigati...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Research questions</strong><br/>My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?<br/>
How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?<br/>
How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?<br/>
<br/>
do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially? How differ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Aim and scope</strong><br/>Aim and Scope – Be sure that your aim responds logically to the problem statement. – Stick rigorously to a single aim. Do not include elements in it that describe how you intend to achieve this aim; reserve these for a later chapter. – When you have written the conclusions to your whole study, check that they respond to this aim. If they don’t, change the aim or rethink your conclusions. – If you change the aim, revise the motivation for studying it. – Be sure to establish the scope of your stud...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Significance</strong><br/>Significance of the Study – Explain how your thesis contributes to the field. – There are four main areas of contribution: theory development, tangible solution, innovative methods, and policy extension. One of these contributions must be identified as the basis of your primary contribution to the field. – In contrast to reports for industry, theory development is an expected and required contribution; for PhDs in particular, it must be ‘original’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Structure of the thesis</strong><br/>Overview of the Study (or Structure of the Thesis) – Sketch out how the thesis is structured. Don’t confine yourself to a list of the chapters, but show how they are linked and that one section logically leads to another. – Check whether the reader can see from this sketch how the aim will be achieved.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Chapter 2: Background</strong><br/>Background Chapters – Include in these chapters all the material required to lead up to your own work. – Ensure that there is a flow of narrative that explains why each topic is being discussed.</p>

Rules about conclusions: • You should dr...</p>

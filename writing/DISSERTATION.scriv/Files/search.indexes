            <Title>the genre thing</Title>
            <Text>Smith is also self-consciously navigating a series of questions about genre that interest me, namely, the fact that not everybody reads everything, or for the same reasons — she is not the same author from genre to genre.
“Very few Smith scholars work actively on both the novels and the poetry, and consequently we have been learning about two separate Smiths, each closely linked to the genre she writes in, neither closely linked to the other. Because the novel during the Romantic period is undergoing an extraordinary amount of change and innovation, as it moves closer to its modern form, editors of the novels (myself included) tend to focus on Smith’s techniques and innovations, her use of tropes and themes, her facility with genres and description. Conversely, because Romantic poetry in the Smithian tradition is so closely tied up with explorations of selfhood and subjectivity, memory and a personalized past, editors of the poetry tend to present it as reflective of a personalized state of mind, of ‘woman’s’ experience, treating its manifold themes and narratives as, finally, reducible to and manifested from Smith’s life. Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres? Genre, it seems, carries a greater force in constructing our preconceptions of identity than has been recognized, and Smith is a case in point, a case we can crack by studying closely Smith’s style and techniques across genres.” (Labbe 5)
Is poet-Smith different or separate from novelist-Smith of didactic-Smith? If so, does that tell us something about poetry or novels, aesthetically? About the marketing or consumption of poetry or novels?
One of my core interests is grappling with heterogenous groups of texts, which are usually examined each in isolation, and trying to bring them together. This might be one of those things that people don’t do because it’s a bad idea, rather than because it’s hard; maybe there aren’t any meaningfully questions that can be posed about All Writing. But I still wonder: are these things as separate from each other as we assume? Are we really dealing with different Smiths, or do we just expect to find different Smiths?</Text>

Suarez: “Lacking the resources to conduct a detailed analysis of the entire ESTC from 1701 to 1800, I have resorted to sampling. Electing to examine all eighteenth-century records that appear in years ending in three – 1703, 1713, 1723 and so on – I have sought to avoid a number of cohort effects, most especially the cumulation of indeterminate records into years ending in ‘0’ or ‘1’ and, to a lesser degree, ‘5’.” (41)</Text>

            <Text>“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
	•	“Bourdieu's sociology radically historicizes the ‘aesthetic disposition' by insisting upon its determination within a class-structured society" (337)
	⁃	“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education” (329-330)
	⁃	"as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (330)
	•	"To say that the aesthetic disposition determines the relative cultural capital granted to any particular work is to say that the act of judgment is the assignment, or even the recognition, of cultural capital. Judgment is the act by which the aesthetic disposition expresses or externalizes itself, according to criteria which are relatively internalized, that is, neither capable of being fully rationalized, nor materially caused in the manner of a biological predisposition.” (332)
	•	"It is no accident that the problem of a specifically ‘aesthetic value' should arise most urgently in the debate on pornography, for it is just in this context that the distinction between aesthetic discourse and the discourse of value evinces the pretensions of both discourses to 'universalize’ / within the boundaries of 'local' communities a particular value." (279-80)

He has a LONG history of the discourses of economics, aesthetics, and ‘moral philosophy’
Key concept: the problem of (in?)commensurability
	•	"the practice of judging works of art need make no reference at all to the concept of value before the emergence of political economy… the comparison of authors or works to one another need not at that time be expressed as the comparison of their relative 'aesthetic values,' because neither the concept of the aesthetic, nor the concept of value, are as yet defined in such a way that they can be yoked together.” (303)
	•	“the market is the historical /condition/ and not merely the proper analogy for the extension of the value-concept to all acts of judgment." (324)
	⁃	“In order to reestablish the proportion of production and consumption, political economy must invent the concept of 'use value,' on the analogy of 'exchange value.’ Casting its lot with an ahtropology of needs, it has to forget the aesthetic theory which posited the surplus of beauty over use as the motor of production, as the engine of social life. The theory of taste becomes irrelevant to political economy, and the 'invisible hand' can be reconceived" (315)
	⁃	“just as bourgeois political economists found it necessary to discard aesthetics, in order to make sense of the system of production and exchange, so did the bourgeoisie find it necessary to take up a 'pure' aesthetics supposedly uncontaminated by economic considerations, in order to distinguish itself /culturally/ from the class which produced what it consumed." (316)
	⁃	“aesthetics immediately reasserted, against the universality of economic commensurability, a theory of the incommensurability of aesthetic and economic values, on the basis of the inutility of the aesthetic object.” (317)
	⁃	"The premise of our social life is the absolute commensurability of everything. The language of judgment has been transformed into the discourse of ‘value-judgments’” --&gt; "cultural relativism's celebration of the plurality of values” (323)

Actual aesthetics are everywhere
	•	Bourdieu - “while there are two fields of production-- the restricted (High Art) and general (cultural commodities)-- there are three principles of legitimacy specific to these fields” aka 1, ‘“art for artists” (“'art for art's sake’") for High Art; 2, art for the social elite, “‘bourgeois' taste”, also for High Art; 3, "the principle of legitimacy which its advocates call 'popular’,” mass consumption, for cultural commodities (330)
	•	"For Bourdieu, aesthetic judgment comes in two forms: an elite aesthetic of the dominant classes, the ‘aesthetic disposition' proper, and a ‘popular' aesthetic of the dominated." (332)
	⁃	What appears in the place of aesthetic pleasure in the dominant classes is the pleasure of _distinction_, pleasure in the possession of cultural capital." (333)
	•	“the largest effect of the discourse of canonicity: the illusion that aesthetic experience is really restricted to the experience of High Cultural works." (336)
	⁃	“As Michael Denning has recently reminded us, there are innumerable examples in working-class cultural forms of formal experiment and variation; it is precisely the experience of formal innovation which engages interest and admiration in these consumers, even though such manifestly aesthetic experience... may fail to be recognized as aesthetic.” (336)
	⁃	"The recognition of cultural capital, otherwise known as aesthetic judgment, must deny, as a condition of its exercise, the ubiquity of aesthetic experience, the fact that such experience utterly pervades the field of cultural production." (336)

What other worlds are possible?
First, have to actually reform access.
	•	Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
	•	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)

Then, works will still compete, but differently.
	•	“The idea of production for the producers (which by definition entails /consumption/ by the producers) projects onto a utopian screen the disarticulation of cultural capital from the system of class formation, and thus from ‘distinction' based on inequality of access to cultural goods. Bourdieu calls this condition 'total autonomy from the laws of the market.' Such a condition does not, however, prophesy the disappearance of cultural capital. The universalization of restricted production would rather transform cultural capital into pure 'symbolic distinction.’” (339)
	⁃	“Even were such an educational system no longer to regulate access to cultural capital in the grotesquely unequal way it presently does, cultural producers would still compete to have their products read, studied, looked at, heard, lived in, sung, worn, and would still accumulate cultural capital in the form of 'prestige’ or fame. But social distinctions reinstated on such an aesthetic basis would have to be expressed in social relations as distinctions in ‘lifestyle,' in other words a vast enlargement of the field of aesthetic judgment." (339)
	⁃	“What we call canon formation would then become a much larger part of social life, because not restricted to the institutions of the materially advantaged.” (339)

            <Text>Chapter 4 of this dissertation examines the works of Ann Radcliffe across several digital corpora. Ann Radcliffe is selected as a contrasting model of popularity, as a famous and popular author with a relatively short list of publications in only one genre. Radcliffe is a particularly useful case study author to contest the relevance of “editions” as a marker of popularity: many of the later editions of her works had very large print runs, since the works were sure to sell, such that a decline in reissues is in fact a sign of success rather than failure. The precise details of these editions and their implications occupy much of chapter 4, and provide important complications for the models of popularity and legacy developed with Charlotte Smith and Mary Robinson in chapters 2 and 3. Radcliffe’s first publication is at the beginning of this dissertation’s decade of interest: in 1789, Radcliffe published her first novel, The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, which reached five London editions by the time of her death. In 1790, she published A Sicilian Romance, which reached six London editions. In 1792, The Romance of the Forest, which reached eight London editions. This novel earned her more positive notice and began the momentum for her career: it is after the success of The Romance of the Forest that her first two novels reached their second editions. In 1794, Radcliffe published her fourth novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho, which had two London editions that year, and reached twelve London editions by her death. In 1795, Radcliffe published her only non-novel work, the travelogue A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794, which saw two editions in London that year and a third before her death. In 1797, she published the last new novel to be released during her lifetime, The Italian, which reached a second edition before her death. After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Radcliffe’s works continued to be reprinted domestically and internationally nearly every year, but she ceased publishing new works. In 1802, Radcliffe wrote, but did not publish, Gaston de Blondville, which would finally appear in print posthumously in 1826. In 1816, a “new” publication appeared: an unauthorized volume Poems by Mrs Ann Radcliffe, anthologizing poems previously appearing in her novels. Radcliffe died in February of 1823. This prompted reprints of all of her works by S. Fisher in 1823, and by Ballantyne in 1824. In 1826, her husband published several pieces posthumously: Gaston de Blondeville; a poetic piece St. Alban’s Abbey ...To which is prefixed a memoir of the author; and, in New Monthly Magazine, her unfinished essay “On the Supernatural in Poetry.”</Text>

            <Title>my corpus</Title>
            <Text>My own sliver of the ESTC was generously provided to me by the British Library in January 2017. It contains all items matching the query I specified, “(Words= alldocuments and W-year= 1789-&gt;1799 and W-Country of publica= enk),” which requests all documents published between 1789 and 1799 (inclusive) with a place of publication encoded as “England.” Running this search on the ESTC website at the time returned 52,001 records. The tools used to create the file, according to the librarian with whom I corresponded, returned 51,965 records, 36 records having gone missing; however, the file itself contains only 51,860, another 105 mysteriously lost. These 141 missing records are currently an unsolved mystery. My records come from the British Library’s ESTC database, rather than the STAR file. The corpus itself consists of a csv file with fifteen columns of information. The columns are: “Type of resource” (“Monograph” or “Serial”); “ESTC citation number”; “Name” (e.g., of an author, editor or illustrator); “Dates associated with name” (generally, the years they lived); “Type of name” (“meeting/conference,” “organization,” or “person”); “Role” (e.g., “author,” “cartographer,” or “bookseller”), “All names”, “Title”, “Variant titles”, “Place of publication”, “Publisher”, “Date of publication” (a single year), “Date of publication (not standardised)” (e.g., a year in roman numerals, or a date which includes a month or day), and “Publication date range” (for serials). In other words, it includes the very basic information of author, title, publisher, and year, in a complex structure which belies the apparent simplicity of these “basics.” Some of the ESTC records included in this corpus do not necessarily match my selection criteria (England, 1789-99), which is inevitably true of every corpus collected, and which I discuss in more detail in SECTION, Data Cleaning.</Text>

            <Text>In spite of her generosity and dedication, More’s activities as an educator and social worker have been harshly criticized by later writers. In her scholarly 1952 biography Hannah More, the historian M. G. Jones wrote that More’s involvement with the Mendip poor is 
responsible in great part for the unsympathetic portrait of her which has been handed down to posterity. In it she appears as a masterful, dogmatic woman, a high Tory in politics, a rigid Evangelical in reli- gion, using her undeniable talents for organization to dragoon the wretched, ignorant, ill-nourished population into schools which did not attempt to offer opportunity to children and adults to improve their material conditions. (Jones, 152) 
Unable to refute these charges, Jones can offer only the partial excuse that More’s attitudes were typical of her time. Like “the bulk of her contemporaries,” More attributed poverty “to the depravity of [the working] class,” rather than “to the failure of the Great Society to realize its responsibilities. . . . Hannah More reacted to the problem of poverty in a manner characteristic of reformers throughout the eighteenth century. To her the problem was a religious, not an economic one” (Jones, 152–53). (Nardin 268)
Most of the scholars who have followed Jones condemn More in similar terms. She has generally been portrayed as an unbending Burkean conservative, who undertook to educate the lower classes primarily, if not entirely, as a means of indoctrinating them in the principles of social sub- mission. For example, Patricia Demers argues in a recent study that More’s “belief in a natural hierarchical social order,” a belief which Demers finds “angering in its condescension and immobility,” prevented More from doing anything significant to improve conditions among the poor (Demers, 2). Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace takes an even darker view of the relationship between More’s Tory convictions and her philanthropic projects. Her 1991 book admits that the More sisters did indeed offer economic aid to their protégés, but argues that their efforts were “controlled by a class politic,” rather than by a genuine desire to relieve suffering /(Kowaleski-Wallace, 72). Though Kowaleski-Wallace acknowledges that “literally” it was “charitable” of the More sisters to distribute “warm clothing” and other material benefits, she unmasks their true motive as the desire “to establish a particular kind of bodily discipline” among the poor by forcing them to dress and behave like members of the middle classes (Kowaleski-Wallace, 68). Like Jones, Demers and Kowaleski-Wallace argue that More’s attitudes were “characteristic” of the period.1 (Nardin 268-9)
There are two problems with these judgments. First, they greatly exaggerate More’s dedication to church and state. Though it is true that the “mainstream” Tory position incorporated constructive criticism of existing institutions within a generally conservative framework, More was angrier and more deeply critical of both church and state than the scholars discussed above allow. And her disaffection increased markedly during the 1790s. Second, these judgments do not relate More’s activities to their historical context in a sufficiently nuanced manner. No “characteristic” or “typical” attitude toward the poor marked the years from 1789 to 1803. An acrimonious debate over the cause and cure of poverty characterized the period, a debate to which More responded in an idiosyncratic manner. As her own views changed, a period of reaction set in, and this conjunction of events prevented her from negotiating a wholly satisfactory public stance. (Nardin 269)
The aim of this essay, then, is to re-examine More’s opinions about poverty, paying particular attention to the contemporary situation and the cross pressures to which it subjected her. I hope to show that, although More was a less enthusiastic believer in the “hierarchical social order” than most scholars have argued, the evasions and compromises she engaged in as a practical reformer helped to damage her reputation with posterity.  (Nardin 269)

            <Text>“To hear Charlotte Smith talk about her writing, you would think she was a drudge or even a hack, ‘compelled,’ as she now famously put it, ‘to live only to write &amp; write only to live’ … Except that she is continually ordering or borrowing books… she seems to have her nose to a grindstone and her eyes shut to all literary value. … one suddenly discovers someone who is reading every principal piece of literature available and commenting sharply on the success or lack thereof of many contemporary productions.” (Curran 175)

“If we want to know about Charlotte Smith’s views as a literary critic… we must turn to her novels and poems, where she holds almost obsessive dialogue with other literature.” (175)

“In English she returns again and again to Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Thomson, Gray, Collins, Goldsmith, Sterne, and, her favourite contemporary poet, William Cowper. Among French writers her taste is highly eclectic, though she returns often to La Rouchefoucauld, Rousseau, and, especially, Voltaire… Her Italian favourites are Petrarch’s sonnets and Mestasio’s operatic arias… She knows no German, but is keenly aware of the distinctive place occupied by Goethe’s Werther in the literature of sensibility. There is one other literature in which she is not only proficient but, for a woman author, surprisingly forthcoming: Latin. She certainly admires Cicero, Horace, and Ovid, but she reserves a special place for Virgil.” (Curran 176)
— Cf Guillory: she OUGHT to be succeeding on all the metrics for cultural capital, but gets left behind when we change those metrics..?

            <Title>Lesser &amp; Farmer debate</Title>
            <Text>A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer &amp; Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.”

Blayney believes that Lesser &amp; Farmer attempt to disprove his “one inescapable fact about printed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been” (7). But what really matters to him about identifying the “best-selling moneyspinners” of the day is not the ‘moneyspinning’ — the question of whether, when a publisher bought a play, he was making a sound financial decision — but about the cultural centrality of ‘bestsellers’. The total market share of religious texts matters, not because it meant that publishers turned their highest profits off of religious texts, but because “[c]ustomers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other ‘literary’ publications,” evidence of “just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers” (7). Lesser and Farmer do not contradict the importance of religious texts to readers. But, in setting out “not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (F&amp;L 213), they make the case that books with low market share, books that are not “best-selling,” could nonetheless be “moneyspinners.” Their rebuttal states that “...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low” (F&amp;L 213), but what they leave somewhat unstated is: “in high demand” with whom?

My own work seeks to examine reprints, but in a more limited fashion than Farmer &amp; Lesser were able to do. Rather than determine the reprint rate of various kinds of fiction, I carry out a Blayney-style examination of pure market share. I seek to identify reprints in order to determine the market share of new versus reprinted material in any given year. </Text>

            <Title>critical algorithm studies</Title>
            <Text>What’s crucial, to use computational reading reparatively, is to use it reflectively. The desirable kinds of computation which I describe above will not happen inevitably. Here I draw upon the rich body of work emerging in critical algorithm studies, which examines (and attempts to reform) the human elements of computational algorithms. Any methodology is, to a certain extent, an “algorithm,” in the loose definition of ‘a series of pre-defined steps to be carried out’. But computational algorithms differ from “algorithms” implemented by humans. Computational algorithms have two key vulnerabilities: first, their operations are less easily scrutinized; second, their results are more easily trusted. The second vulnerability — the cultural aura of empirical trustworthiness which accrues to anything ‘computational’ — is another flavour of the same vulnerability that Drucker describes with ‘data’ generally. Because the human agents who designed and trained any given algorithm appear to be absent from its operation, the algorithm appears able to discover truth directly. This is how Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra was able to tweet with disdain that “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claims that algorithms, which are driven by math, are racist” (@RealSaavedra): anything “driven by math,” he assumes, must be incapable of human fallibilities like racism. But as Safiya Noble shows extensively in Algorithms of Oppression, algorithms by default reproduce, and can easily exaggerate, the assumptions and biases of the culture in which they are made (CITE). In other words, in a racist world, algorithms are racist — and sexist, and duplicative of all other systemic inequities. To analyze an algorithm, one must articulate the implicit argument underlying the assumptions that allow it to operate — what Ian Bogost would call its procedural rhetoric. As Katherine Bode’s recent work on data-rich literary history has shown, digital infrastructures themselves contain an implicit procedural rhetoric, even an argument, which must be addressed.</Text>

p.165: John Guillory's book usefully troubles such reductive correlations.
p.166: Thus the dilemma of liberal pluralism: of wanting simultaneously to integrate excluded minority works into a reorganized yet once more unified canon and to preserve what is understood as cultural difference.
p.166: The syllabus is the "institutional form" of linguistic and symbolic capital (ix), which capital is more critical than the ideological content of individual works in determining access to literacy, Guillory argues, developing Bourdieu's insistence on a cultural as well as an economic account of class difference.
p.166: The limitations of Guillory's critique are most visible when he presents case studies. Guillory provides no real account of what, at a given moment in institutional and cultural history, determines the valorization of some works over others.
p.167: Today the category of "literature" carries the stigma of institutional "dysfunctionality" as the traditional cultural capital of a tired bourgeoisie. This is due to the rise, Guillory reminds us, of what Alvin Gouldner called the "professional-managerial class" which has made obsolete the cultural capital represented by bothcanonical and noncanonical literature. To the professional-managerial class, the canon debate is a convenient irrelevance, for it distracts attention from its own cultural capital—real power that increasingly threatens to maroon the participants in the canon debates "on an ever shrinking island within the university itself" (45).
p.167: Guillory's interest is to reprise aesthetic value qua cultural capital, in order to resist its reduction to the "quasi-economic concept of 'use-value'" and to recognize the distinction between cultural and material capital
p.168: Perhaps the most valuable aspect of Guillory's analysis is that it is still among the most minutely argued and provocative attempts of the 1990s to reconceive the canon debates and disentangle them from the multiculturalist debates. It hints at the possibilities of a more class-sensitive critique of the dissemination of cultural values via the canon. But in seeking to reterritorialize the canon debate, Guillory constricts the scope of this very cultural critique.
p.168: Ultimately Guillory seems not to grasp the forces of the public sphere that drive the canon debates into energetic articulation with the multiculturalist debates.</Text>

            <Title>Bainbridge is wrong about print culture &amp; reprinting</Title>
            <Text>Bainbridge frequently discusses strategies of print publication as part of his analysis: a particularly insightful footnote discusses, for example, a poem which circulated both as an ode in a magazine and as lyrics in a broadsheet. Bainbridge observes that “texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration” (10). However, his explanations of individual print strategies are often hindered by his approach to literature’s cultural capital. At one point, for example, he argues that “the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott” (53). I contend that the republication of substantially older works of literature is not a sign that England was destitute of true poetry before Walter Scott, but rather an attempt to solve the challenges to national identity posed by the 1790s’ disruption of history.</Text>

            <Title>Farmer &amp; Lesser 2 Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade</Title>
            <Text>“So the debate centers not on facts or figures but rather on a more fundamental issue: how to theorize the meaning of *popularity* in the book trade and, specifically, how to interpret the relationship between market share and reprint rates when assessing popularity. We developed the concept of *structures of popularity* because we believe that these two criteria should be considered in dynamic relation to each other, to total number of editions, and to profitability. Blayney, on the other hand, argues that the total number of editions (and thus the market share) of sermon-books "completely vitiates" the usefulness of playbook reprint rates as an index of popularity.” (207)

“we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

"a reprint indicates that the previous edition had sold out (or was about to sell out) and that the publisher anticipated enough continuing demand to justify a further edition. The reprint rate for an entire class of books tells us how frequently a given title within that class achieved this type of economic success and, consequently, how often a publisher had the chance to enjoy the increased profits possible with reprint editions. Reprint rates, therefore, allow us to auge both the demand among retail customers for certain classes of books and the investment risk faced by speculating publishers.” (208)

Need to look at reprint rates, not just total number of reprints; playbooks twice as likely to be reprinted, even though there were twice as many second-ed sermon books

"Readers interested in how the chi-square test is performed can consult &lt;http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/ballc/webtools/web_chi.html or any introductory statistics textbook.” (209)

Blayney's semi-bad-faith argument about Tomkis v Shakespeare turns out to be solved with chi-square test -- samples are too small for variation to be statistically significant

"What the comparison of playbooks and sermon-books reveals is that neither market share nor reprint rates tells the entire story of ‘popularity’.
Thus while we agree with Blayney about the facts concerning the market shares of sermon-books and playbooks, we differ over how those facts relate to reprint rates and to ‘popularity' in the book trade.” (211)

“...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low.” (213)

“An approach based on structures of popularity this attempts not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (213)</Text>

            <Title>1990s canon debate</Title>
            <Text>In other words, Gamer and Taylor both affirm the key conclusion of John Guillory’s Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation, that “in fact ‘aesthetic value’ is nothing more or other than cultural capital” (332). Guillory’s sociological history of literary canons is a well established part of literary studies, which will take on new dimensions as I apply it to the current moment of digital databases. In the eighteenth century, he argues, the cultural capital of vernacular English literature is defined by its use within the school system to enable and restrict social mobility. English vernacular literature first begins to accumulate cultural capital in middle-class schools where it is “a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97) that would allow readers to improve and signify their social standing. The public re-assessment of literature as described by Gamer and Taylor is, for Guillory, “the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel” (xi), which seem in danger of affording too much social mobility by offering too little literary distinction for social elites. The ‘solution’ is institutionalization, in which “the school becomes the exclusive agent for the dissemination of High Canonical works,” and therefore, he argues, “the prestige of literary works as cultural capital is assessed according to the limit of their dissemination, their relative exclusivity” (133). Under this system, ‘serious’ literature may not be identifiable linguistically, but it can still be identifiable by the difficulty of accessing it. This history of canonization has important implications for the field of literary study. As Guillory himself insists, if the aesthetic value of a text is determined by the social operations of class, it undermines the notion of literature itself as a category of writing distinguishable in aesthetic terms from non-literary writing. Guillory’s book is motivated by the canon debates of the 1990s, which were driven by an urgent re-valuation of literature by women and people of colour. His response insists that it is untenable to conceive of the problem in terms of increasing the ‘representation’ of individual works or authors within existing systems. Instead, for Guillory problem lies in the institutionalization of literature itself. “If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain,” he says, embedding his prescription in that “if,” “it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon” (265). In other words, assigning the cultural capital of “literature” to different works cannot change the underlying system.</Text>
            <Comments>‘Too much’ and ‘too little’ are here, of course, defined from the point of those with cultural capital which they wish to maintain.
Q for Gillespie: should I still research “the new formalist work to reclaim the literary qua the literary - and e.g. Steve Conner's - ‘nah’” ? What is useful/important to address in this work, given what I say here?
Part of Guillory’s argument is that, although the rhetoric of the canon debates generally sought to re-value authors of any number of oppressed categories, often using the phrase “gender, race, and class” as a single unit, the work undertaken was in fact unable to address class, since class operates differently from gender and race.
Do I need to say more about this? I feel like I’ve already spent a long time on Guillory.

Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (Qtd in Guillory 339-340)</Comments>

            <Title>1790s canon debate</Title>
            <Text>The problem of evaluating literature is not a new or a simple one. In the eighteenth century, the debate took the form of urgently needing to distinguish ‘trash’ from ‘treasure’. Michael Gamer, in Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation, highlights the role of the eighteenth-century reviewer as a crucial mediator between the writers and readers of books. Importantly, although the assessments take the form of reviews of individual works, Gamer also argues that the critics’ objections are in fact “a regulatory discourse – carried out under the fiction of paternalistic advice to a given gothic writer, but functioning as an implicit threat to other readers and writers” that affiliation with the gothic comes with “cultural costs” (42). The gothic stands in as a proxy for any kind of “popular” reading that takes place “in the absence of formal education and training” (57), so a denunciation of a gothic work becomes a reaffirmation of class-based literary hierarchies. In other words, these reviews create and affirm the cultural capital of a category of ‘serious’ literature. Gamer is only concerned with the gothic and romanticism, but the overall regulatory function of literary reviewers as moral arbiters— and the stock conventionality of their objections, which do not affect the actual production or consumption of the works attacked— applies to most forms of writing in the period. For example, George Taylor sees the same dynamic in the theatre. In The French Revolution and the London Stage, he argues that, “[c]ritics might make sharp comparisons” between the many kinds of entertainments that were staged, “but little of the programme was dismissed [by audiences] as ‘trash', or ‘immoral', or irrelevant ‘fancy’” (3). Taylor sees the repetitive discourse of eighteenth-century literary critics as proof of a larger social divide: “Disagreement as to what is trash and what is treasure suggests cultural crisis, when values are put under question by social stress or political conflict” (3). Gamer and Taylor both suggest that moral judgment of literature by its critics was driven by social friction, rather than by the aesthetic distinctions which they claimed as their motivation.</Text>
            <Comments>Reviewers sought to dictate the social assessment of individual literary works in order to enforce morality for society at large.[ The emerging idea of the public sphere (cf Habermas) in the eighteenth century brought with it an urgent task of literary assessment. — this is true but maybe I don’t have to say it! and then I don’t have to waste time talking about Habermas] [They basically say so themselves in their reviews—I’ll quote a juicy representative one.] 
The really clever bit of Gamer’s argument is that he then unpacks how Romantics, especially Wordsworth, use just enough Gothic material to sell their books while also repeating these conventional attacks on the Gothic — they get to have their cake and eat it too, pursuing both financial and cultural capital. But I don’t think that’s relevant here.</Comments>

            <Text>Databases of Eighteenth-Century Literature, 1789-99
Returning to the eighteenth century, and how it has been digitized: the baseline hypothesis, investigating a historical phenomenon, is that factors like systemic sexism are likely to have an effect. As I have shown above, the digital archives currently used by eighteenth-century scholars were created during their own historic moments, which influenced their priorities as texts were digitized. Resources which provide more information about particular works — such as ECCO, which provides PDF scans of microfiche, or the TCP, which provides detailed XML-encoded transcripts — inevitably provide their more thorough information about fewer texts. The ESTC is able to include so many works in its database in part because it includes so little about each work: not much more than the information found on the title page, and a list of libraries where the original can be consulted. Google Books (the source of HathiTrust’s images) achieved its scale in part by dramatically reducing the detail and precision of each work’s records. As the more resource-intensive archives created their digital surrogates, therefore, the texts they include are likely to be less indiscriminate, and more strongly influenced by a personal assessment of what works are most important. In many other areas, writing by women has been dismissed as less important or worthy of serious study than writing by men. If we compare the holdings of major digital archives, do the smaller and more resource-intensive archives show evidence of similar choices to systematically opt out of an investment in women’s writing?
Guillory’s Cultural Capital proposes that, if female authors, for example, do not make up a demographically accurate 50% of our literary syllabi, this is not necessarily because women’s writing has been excluded or repressed. Guillory draws a distinction between rhetoric “construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power” — that is, the patriarchal suppression of works by women, which can be addressed by now ‘representing’ the excluded works within the canon — versus what he sees as the real cause, a historical fact that “women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” Applied to the digital database, the first explanation, which might be termed the ‘exclusion hypothesis,’ would manifest in the form of massive archives with large numbers of works by men and women, which get filtered through exclusionary scholarly processes into smaller, selective repositories where men now make up an oversized share. In the second explanation, which might be termed the ‘absence hypothesis,’ works by women will have a diminished role from the very beginning, since women were prevented from writing in the first place.
I have taken information from four resources most strongly targeted to scholars of eighteenth century literature, namely, the English Short Title Catalogue, Eighteenth Century Collections Online, HathiTrust, and the Text Creation Partnership. Since it would be infeasible in many ways to compare the full holdings of all these resources, we much take a consistent sliver from each resource, and compare within those parameter. Let us examine works published in England, between 1789 and 1799. After removing misclassified works, the ESTC contained 51,090 titles, ECCO 26,848 titles, HathiTrust 8,220 titles, and the TCP only 525 titles. ECCO, in all its capaciousness, therefore contains only 52.5% of the titles listed in the ESTC. The TCP provides access to an almost negligible 1% of the works published. At this scale, let us follow the fate of a larger figure than Charlotte Smith herself, and see how “the named woman” fares.
Smaller, less comprehensive archives do generally dedicate a higher percentage of their space to male authors. As Figure 3 shows, 43% of the 51,090 titles in the ESTC from this decade are identifiably by men, which rises substantially to 69% for HathiTrust and 67% for the TCP.

However, as Figure 4 shows, the increase in male authors is not at the expense of identifiable female authors, who make up a stable or increasing percentage of the works as databases grow more specialized— including an astonishing 22% of the TCP corpus.
￼
Figure 4: The percentage of works published in England 1789-99 with male versus female authors, as identified by the ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP.
The initial number for women, of course, is extremely low: a mere 3%. This is far below the percentage of women found in genre-specific surveys. For example, during the years 1789-99, 20.2% of the new novels written in England were attributed to female names on their title pages and prefaces. The ESTC and ECCO have a lot of medical texts, sermons, natural histories, legal opinions, and other genres from which women are de factor excluded. HathiTrust’s slight increase in female authorship might show a collections-level bias where university libraries prefer slightly more interesting or recognizably “literary” materials like novels, poetry, and drama, all of which allowed for female authorship. But even if the TCP were assumed to contain exclusively novels, at 22% female authorship it would be statistically overrepresenting women. The TCP is the one operating based on the most recent decision-making, since even HathiTrust is constrained to the library collecting decisions of past decisions, and thus doesn’t necessarily reflect the priorities of 2000s scholars.
In Figure 5, however, we can see that the overlooked group, unable to compete with male authors for archival attention, is not “female authors” but “authors which are not associated with an individual personality.” The category “unsigned” here captures works to which no name at all was signed (essentially, anonymous works, though in this period of course the absence of a name does not imply the concealment of a name as it would in the contemporary definition of “anonymous”) as well as pseudonymous works which offered no clues to an author’s gender (e.g. “A friend of peace”). “Organizations” include missives from various branches of the government, reports from scholarly and charitable organizations, catalogues from various companies, and other works which are easily rejected as “non-literary.” The identifier “blank,” for ECCO, appears to capture both unsigned works and works by organizations.

￼
Figure 5: The relative authorship status of works published in England 1789-99, as identified by the ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP. Works by “org” are attributed to organizations as their authors, such as the House of Commons. “Unsigned” works have no information in the author field. “Blank” in ECCO captures both unsigned works and works by organizations, which I have not yet been able to distinguish. Works by “initials” include those by, e.g., W.H. Ireland, even when the database has provided a clearly gendered expansion of the initials (e.g., a listing of “W[illiam] H[enry] Ireland”), to reflect the fact that the original author listing was of ambiguous gender. From my casual inspection, in nearly all cases of attributed to initials where a known author name is also supplied, the author is male. An author will be identified as “male” or “female” rather than as “initials” if, in addition to the initials, a gendered title is provided, e.g., “Mrs. R.” The “uncategorized” works are those which I have not manually assessed; anecdotally, these appear to consist mostly of pseudonyms, mostly male.

There are two ways to explain the disappearance of unsigned authors from smaller corpora. The first explanation is that unsigned authors have, essentially, faced discrimination due to their status as unsigned: out of a fixed pool of unsigned works, fewer were chosen for further scholarly dissemination than from the pool of signed works. The second explanation is that the further dissemination of a work, or scholarly investment in a work, reduces the likelihood that it will remain unsigned in the database. For an author to appear as “unsigned” here, they need not only be absent from the title page, but they also need to have avoided a later scholarly attribution of authorship. Names are placed into the relevant database fields wherever possible, supplying new information that cannot be found on the title page and may have been entirely unavailable to eighteenth century readers. Ann Radcliffe’s first novel, for example, was published unsigned, and the next several editions identified her as the “authoress” of the previous works, and only with the third edition of The Romance of the Forest did the name “Ann Radcliffe” appear on the book. All of the earlier editions, however, are consistently linked to Ann Radcliffe as the author in the internal database, and in the data I was able to access. There is obvious practical use in disseminating author identifications — indeed, there is very little point in determining the authors of pseudonymous works if this information is not fully incorporated into the scholarly record. But this particular implementation also occludes how eighteenth century readers actually encountered author information. An identified name overwrites the information recorded on the title page. In this way, scholars have worked to infrastructurally eliminate the “unsigned” author.
Rather than finding bias against authors based on the social category of gender, then, I have found a much stronger bias in favour of a particular concept of the author itself. These resources assume, in their very infrastructure, that the “author” must be reducible to a single, known individual. ECCO so thoroughly rejects the idea that organizations could be considered as “authors” that it does not record them in the “author” field. The underrepresentation of unsigned or corporate authors cannot be mapped onto the multicultural rhetoric of political representation, the way Guillory has described with gendered representation. Instead, the meaning of this finding stems from the very lack of a broader social importance to “unsigned” or “non-individual” authors as a class of humans: the conclusions we can draw here are not about the world at large, but about the institutional processes of academic research.
“Representativeness” in Databases
Returning to the idea of “representativeness” — what it means for a database to “represent” or be “representative of” a population — returns us, also, to the still-fraught relationship between distant reading and the conception of the literary canon. Twenty years after Guillory, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain,” now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” is the problem of conceiving of a “world” literature, rather than the “canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature.” His new methods are meant to enable literary studies to examine a new object. The field of distant reading has been moving away from Moretti himself. However, it is still shaped by the attempt to redefine the disciplinary domain of literary studies. In many cases, the new domain is no longer the “canon” but the “corpus,” a collection of texts which are studied en masse for macroanalytical insights. Katherine Bode, for example, in “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading,” argues that Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers replicate the approaches of New Criticism with their corpora, and calls for “a new scholarly object of analysis” that directly examines historical and textual context of corpora as representations of “literary systems.” Lauren Klein, too, treats the textual corpus as the new object of literary analysis requiring curation, contextualization, and interpretation. Her critique argues that “it’s not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading can’t do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so.” Bode, too, despite her strong critique of distant reading as it has been practiced by Moretti and Jockers, does not blame distant reading itself. Distant readers like Moretti and Jockers, she argues, “while claiming direct and objective access to ‘everything,’ … represent and explore only a very limited proportion of the literary system, and do so in an abstract and ahistorical way.” Klein, like Bode, calls for “more corpora—more accessible corpora—that perform the work of recovery or resistance” to allow research “beyond quote ‘representative’ samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole.” This framing re-creates, at the site of the corpus, the identical narratives of exclusion and representation which were previously located in critiques of the canon.
The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus, on the surface of it, is not without grounds. Challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new “great unread.” Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. However, what we learn from these case studies, of Charlotte Smith and of the 1790s at large, is that the decisions made about inclusion and exclusion from digital databases simply do not mirror the decisions made in syllabi or anthologies.
I contend that each database is best understood as a negotiation between the noncommercial values of textual reproduction and the commercial environment in which institutions much remain financially solvent. Each database has the goal of making valuable information available. After the 1990s, they are particularly influenced by the utopian ideal that digital reproduction at last made textual reproduction free. Each had to contend, however, with the fact that before a text can be reproduced digitally it must be created digitally, and that even if the material costs are entirely eliminated (which, of course, they are not) textual creation continues to have costs in labour. In Paddy Bullard’s “Digital Humanities and Electronic Resources in the Long Eighteenth Century,” which surveys the research completed and the resources used as of 2013, Bullard is also faced with the task of explaining why multiple services interact so poorly. Bullard, too, observes the core tension between public access vs private profit: 
Viewing the field of eighteenth-century digital humanities as a single prospect, it is the contrast between publicly funded, open-access sites, and privately owned, subscription-access resources that is most striking. Each side of the divide has much to learn from the other. Publicly funded academic projects must acquire the pragmatism and ambitiousness of scale that commercial developers have always shown. Commercial developers must adapt themselves more generously to the principles of scholarly openness and accuracy. They might also imitate the inventiveness of the open sector, its adaptability to the demands raised by different kinds of primary media. Both sides recognize the desirability of making their resources interoperable across the divide, and the business of interconnectivity will preoccupy all kinds of digital humanist in the coming decade.
Bullard is correct to note that there are major disjunctions between databases like the The British Book Trade Index or careful online editions like The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674–1913, compared to massive archives like ECCO. It seems odd, however, to attribute to ECCO both “ambitiousness of scale” and “pragmatism” as the lessons for noncommercial projects to imitate, since an ambitious scale is only plausibly pragmatic for a project with the money to sustain itself. Even odder is the idea that commercial developers might voluntarily choose to “adapt themselves more generously to the principles of scholarly openness and accuracy,” when the core business model of a private enterprise relies on its lack of openness, and private access only seems worth purchasing when its marketers suppress all nuance about accuracy. As Bode observes, “the commercial imperatives of these enterprises arguably depend on them presenting these collections as comprehensive.” In other words, Bullard has observed an underlying system of profit and non-profit organizations in awkward competition, examined the outputs of each approach in order to articulate their particular virtues, and finally described what a ‘best of both worlds’ might look like if both parts of the system sought to collaborate together on how best to achieve maximally useful scholarly resources. What Bullard overlooks in this process is that not all parts of this system have the goal of achieving maximally useful scholarly resources.
Bullard suggests tentatively that university presses might be the site of bridging efforts between the non-profit and for-profit worlds, but where we can actually see an example occurring is in the Text Creation Partnership. The TCP attempted to intervene in the system with “a public-private partnership, led by libraries;” their materials emphasize the “librarian’s attitude toward content” which prioritizes the widest possible access and use. This “librarian’s attitude” is most evident in the (eventual) availability of all of the transcriptions in the public domain, despite the fact that the images they are based on remain privately restricted by the companies which own them.
Their description of the “partnership,” however, continues to show signs of the strain in value systems when commercial and noncommercial goals are intertwined: “Through our partnership with private vendors, we had access to a huge trove of images from which to transcribe. In return, these companies were supplied with a full-text index to their images —work which would have otherwise been difficult or expensive to produce.” In other words, through purchasing a service (access to images), the academic institutions received that service. These academic institutions carried out an enormous feat of labour at their own expense, using the service they purchased. Then, “in return,” they provided the results of their labour to the company, for the company to then further profit from the improvements to their service. Most telling, here, is the word “otherwise” in calling this “work which would have otherwise been difficult or expensive to produce.” The suggestion here is that, without the TCP, the companies themselves would not have been willing to undertake the encoding that was so desired by the users of their service. However, the TCP certainly did not make the task any less difficult or expensive. Instead, academic institutions absorbed the difficulty and expense on those companies’ behalf. I do not say that they were wrong to do so: on the contrary, the “librarian’s attitude” mirrors my own attitude, and it is surely to everyone’s benefit for a wonderful thing to exist even if that wonderful thing is not profitable. Rather, I highlight this rhetorical moment in the TCP’s self description to suggest that it takes two to collaborate, and that no amount of effort on the librarians’ part can change the core institutional drive of a private company. Companies like Gale are perfectly happy to help achieve maximally useful scholarly resources if doing so it also a good way to turn a profit, but this does not mean that they have the same goals as academic institutions. One of the three key aims of the TCP identified on the homepage is to “collaborate with commercial providers, rather than constantly bargaining and competing with them.” However, the TCP seems instead to have simply come up with a better bargain, one which creatively offers scholarly labour as a bargaining chip.
What do these database histories mean for scholars of eighteenth century literature? First and foremost, these histories provide another reminder that scholarly materials do not exist prior to interpretation or intervention. It is not merely that they are shaped or influenced by their institutional contexts, implying small quirks or edge cases which can generally be ignored: they are constituted in the first place by those institutional contexts. Second, these histories suggest a course of action to be taken in response to the specific institutional factors constituting each database. Scholars periodically acknowledge the gaps between historical events as they occurred and the specific archive, database, or corpus that they are using as a proxy for the idealized concept of “the historical record,” but these acknowledgements typically take the form of a statement that some form of bias is assumed to exist, but that this bias is so unknowable and unavoidable that naturally we will just continue onward as if it was not present. Identifying the specific institutional process that led to the current digital infrastructure undermines efforts to brush off these details as unknowable: directly investigating the actual demographics of each resource’s holdings can also render these biases no longer unavoidable.
Conclusion
As archivists and librarians often note, “the archive” is not only a concept to be brought into play with literary theory, but a specific and materially constructed space, shaped by archivist labor and constraints. A digital archive is no different. To explain the current contents of online databases like ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP, we must look to histories that begin before the internet itself. Recognizing that they are historically constructed resources, we can be alert to selection factors that cause all of them, even the most comprehensive, to differ from the imagined prior whole of “literature” which we might wish for them to represent. More importantly, attention to their particular details reveals that the systemic selection factors that have defined their gaps and exclusions do not always map onto the demographics we dedicate the most attention to recovering. Corporate business models are likely to play as large a role as social biases. Scholarly infrastructure can create new demographics like “the unsigned author” which do not constitute an identity category in the real world. And sometimes success creates its own new puzzles: it is a valuable accomplishment of the TCP, for example, that it has increased the availability of writing by women — but it seems prudent for researchers to assume that using the TCP to gather samples of works published in England during the late eighteenth century will yield samples which do not reflect the population. Unless researchers takes explicit steps to the contrary, these samples will not reflect eighteenth century history, but their own.</Text>

            <Text>“Exploratory studies, poorly funded and inadequate though they were, began in the next decade, but not until 1975 did the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies take the initiative in North America, which was swiftly followed and far surpassed by the interest of the British Library, that has led to the present Eighteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue Project.” (Korshin 209)

"The British Library Project maintains a number of manual files based on the works they have catalogued (by mid October 1978, the team had cataogued mor ethan 110,00 items, with a total of 75,000 entries; the difference represents multiple copies), and one can see from this account how usedul the completed work will be to the scholarly and library world. Indeed, as scholars who visit the Project at the British Library or who have been in touch with Alston and Jannetta by letter have already found, even the incomplete British Library file is tremendously helpful to the researcher.” (210)

“The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,” especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). “Panizzis ‘Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book inhis or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.” (Korshin 211)

“By 1984, it is expected that a joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file to that point will be published in computer-output microform (COM).” (Korshin 212)

            <Title>Cronin, Politics of Romantic Poetry</Title>
            <Text>Good lit review. Major monographs: Marilyn Butler’s Romantics, Rebels, and Reactionaries; Jerome McGann’s The Romantic Ideology. Revised by Clifford Siskin, The History of Romantic Discourse.
“Butler and McGann share an ambition to ‘historicize’ Romanticism, and both assume that to historicize is also to politicize. Butler’s account is admirable in its directness and clarity, but its virtues are expensively purchased by maintaining a system of values which, if consistently applied, would support the view that Erasmus Darwin is a better poet than Wordsworth. McGann, by comparison, adopts values which are certainly flexible enough to avoid any such uncomfortable consequence, but he achieved his flexibility only at the risk of inconsistency.” (9)
Siskin is very into sonnets, which I like.
“Butler, McGann, and Siskin… tend to the view that all poetry is political, because, to put it more crudely than any of them would agree to, to write a non-political poem is itself a political act, something like abstaining in a General Election.” (12) “On the face of it, this could be true only if the field of politics were coextensive with reality, and there are some who have argued quite persuasively that this is indeed effectively the case, for in writing reality cannot be encountered, but only represented, and any representation of reality might be said to serve political ends.” (12)
“the kind of political poetry with which I will be concerned, poetry that speaks to a divided society in an attempt to constitute its readers as citizens of what Hill calls, remembering a passage from Hopkins, the just kingdom, and that I prefer to nominate in an echo of Wordsworth ‘the pure commonwealth’. … This will be a book committed to the notion that the political import of a poem is a function of its style quite as much as of its sentiments, and that a poet’s most effective political act is the forging of a new language.” (13)

“It may be that Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads affiliates his own verse with the oral tradition of popular ballads that might seem the best recourse for a poet dedicated to the ‘principle of equality’, but it would be hard to claim that Wordsworth’s poems show a knowledge of that tradition equal to Walter Scott’s, nor that they were so deeply influenced by it, nor that they succeeded in addressing so wide an audience, and no one would claim either that Scott’s Muse was a levelling one, or that Scott developed a poetic style, whatever the claims Lukacs has made for the novels, that expressed the principles of the French Revolution.” (16)  “There is no simple equivalence that allows us to judge the relative radicalism of a text by the width of the readership it addresses… Simpson’s book, for example, is lucid, vigorously written, and free from forbidding jargon, but one would have to accept, surely, that its idiom excluded from its readership the great bulk of ‘ordinary men and women’, and it does not follow from this that Simpson’s politics are latently conservative.” (16)

“Like Butler and McGann, I will divide the Romantic period into three phases: the early period dominates by the Revolution and the Revolutionary war, the time when, as Wordsworth recalled, he and many of his fellow poets found themselves in support of their country’s ‘nominal enemies’; the period of the Napoleonic wars when Britain was in danger of defeat, even invasion; and the immediately post-war period, dominated in Britain by popular unrest. In each case my purpose will be, not to offer a survey of poetry written in the period, but to identify a dominant discourse, and to analyze its limitations.” (16)
“The first period is characterized by the attempt to frame a universal language, a language in which it might be possible to address all of humanity. The most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status was the language of science, and hence it is appropriate that the most celebrated poet of these years, Erasmus Darwin, was concerned ‘to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science’. The language framed by Darwin justifies its claim to universality, in part, by rejecting supernatural in favour of natural explanations of phenomena, that is, by excluding religion. Given that differences of religious belief were among the most powerful forces of division in his world, his tactic is entirely logical, but it results in a paradox. Darwin framed a languages that addresses all of humanity only by rigorously excluding the large majority of human individuals / who were united in their possession of a religious faith, however much they may have been divided by the faiths that they professed. Darwin’s poetry forces one to the conclusion that a universal language may be among the more exclusive idioms available to a poet. I turn then, as a counter to Darwin, to his most talented illustrator, William Blake, who in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell framed a language designed to reconcile the kind of intellectual radicalism shared by Dawin, Priestley and the rest of the literary set that gathered around the publisher Joseph Johnson with the radicalism of the streets, which was apt to express itself in the mode of Biblical prophecy, and to flaunt its own outrageous credulity as a flamboyant rejection of godless common sense. In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell the attempt to produce a work that could be read by all of Blake’s fellow-radicals results, and count only result, in a text remarkable for its massive idiosyncracy. Finally, I turn to Southey and Landor, who courageously continues to write an international poetry at a time when the nations were at war. In them, the attempt to devise a universal language assumes its latest guise: it becomes the mark of the traitor.” (16-7)
“The book’s second part begins with Walter Scott, for Scott, like Erasmus Darwin before him, framed most powerfully the language of the new period, which was not a language designed to unite all mankind but to unite the nation in its war against the French. But all Scott’s poems are set in the past. … no description of Scott’s Britain could avoid encountering the economic, geographical, and political differences that divided the kingdom, a fact which emerges with some clarity when I turn to Wordsworth’s Poems in Two Volumes, a collection which attempted to resolve the differences of his fellow citizens, and succeeded only in provoking a hostility so intense that Wordsworth was deterred from publishing his poems for some years. This section ends with another paradox, the emergence at the very end of the war years of a new poet to usurp Scott’s place as … the chief poet of the nation. It was a station that Byron earned by systematically and flamboyantly refusing any suprapersonal loyalty.” (17)
“The book’s third part is concerned with the post-war years, when the conflict between nations was supplanted by an internal conflict between classes. In the work by Byron and Shelley discussed there the poetic identity that the two poets had chosen as ‘genteel reformers’ becomes itself problematic, with the consequence that, as both recognize, poetic style could no longer disengage itself from class conflict. The book ends / with the Cockney poets, with Leigh Hunt and Keats, who cannot find, any more that Byron or Shelley, a poetic language that subsumes class difference, but who devise a language in which those differences may be uncomfortably contained.” (17-8)
“In his great preface Wordsworth defines the poet as ‘a man speaking to men’. It is the project that unites all the poets that appear in this book, and it is a project in which all of them failed, and not simply because they neglected to address women. They failed because they wrote at a time when there was no language aailable that could address itself to the ‘one human heart’ that they were confident all of us share. This book charts that failure in each of its three phases, each of them presided over, perhaps, by a single iconic figure. Presiding over the first phase is Anarcharsis Cloots, so touchingly dedicated to universal revolution that he once confessed his ambition to establish a republic on the moon, and so confident of the universal power of his own rhetoric that he designated himself ‘Orator of the Human Race’. Nelson presides over the second phase, at the moment when he ordered the signal flags raised before the Battle of Trafalgar, conscious that, despite all his personal peculiarities, at this moment he speaks for ‘England’. The characteristic figure of the third phase is ‘Orator’ Hunt, ‘Bristol’ Hunt, or simply Henry, ascending the platform to make his speech to the thousands gathered at St Peter’s ield in Manchester, recognizable to everyone by virture of his trademark white top hat. That speech was never made, but was forestalled by a cavalry charge by the local militia, a graphic enough demonstration that in 1819 the language that spoke to one section of the population instilled in another only a fierce desire that it should be silenced.” (18)

Section One
Introduction
“the poem never seems confident of whom it is addressing” (24) on Coleridge’s “Religious Musings”
“Its hesitation summarize those of a decade in which poets tried to locate some commanding position from which they could survey the political turmoil through which they were living, only to find that the prophetic voice, the voice removed from time, was unavailable to them, and a decade in which they tried to locate a voice that could harmonize, like Coleridge’s ‘glad stream’, the diverse and contradictory currents that together constituted the English radical tradition only to find that no such voice was available.” (28)

Chapter 1: Erasmus Darwin: From the Bastille to Birmingham
“Erasmus Darwin was the most popular poet of the 1790s, and his The Botanic Garden (1791), in which The Economy of Vegetation formed the first part, and The Loves of Plants (1789) the second, was the decade’s most popular poem.” (29) “The beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden published by Joseph Johnson in 1791, with its elegant typefaces, and its engravings from Fuseli and others, in itself proclaims a confidence in the book’s unusual importance. … His edition of Darwin’s poem registers his recognition of the book’s commercial prospects but also his recognition that the poem gave vivid expression to a set of / beliefs shared by Johnson’s stable of authors, and his confidence that in 1791 such beliefs could be expressed triumphally, by the publication of a volume as costly and elegant as one of Wedgwood’s copies of the Portland Vase, itself reproduced by Blake in the book’s most elaborate engraving.” (29-30)
P. 39-40 — Darwin uses poetry as sugar to make the medicine of rational essays/footnotes go down more smoothly
P. 45 - Darwin’s poem leaves out the very poor, who riot in 1791 and damage property of Priestly, who wants to enfranchise them
“It was not Erasmus Darwin who developed a poetry that could speak to, and out of, the popular radicalism of the 1790s, but the most inventive of his illustrators, William Blake” (47)

Chapter 2: Williams Blake and Revolutionary Prophecy
“The central difficulty of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is the problem of who it was written for.” (48) - a takedown of a Swedenbog piece written for the Johnson circle?
“Throughout the period treated in this book successive governments made a more sustained and vigorous attempt to prevent the publication of Paine’s writings than those of any other radical propagandist, and the reason is obvious enough. They correctly detected in Tom Paine’s prose the achievement of the alliance between intellectual and popular radicalism that they most feared. Their campaign was strikingly unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent Paine’s works becoming more widely available through cheap reprints than the works of any other contemporary writer, and yet the consequence they feared never came to pass.” (59)
“But it would be idle to deny that it remains for all that an entirely eccentric text. Up to a point Blake’s printing methods in themselves account for this. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell exists in nine complete and two incomplete copies, and it seems improbable that very many more copies were ever produced. The contrast with the thousands of copies circulating of Paine’s Rights of Man needs no underlining. But it would be idle to pretend that the Marriage, even if Blake had devised a way of printing that made possible a wide circulation, would ever have achieved wide popularity, and this was not because Blake as an eccentric, but because his project was.” (60) “in making such an attempt Blake is likely to succeed only in writing the manifesto of a party of which he is the only member” (60)

Chapter 3: The English Jacobins
“1798 was the year of The Anti-Jacobin. In its first incarnation, as a weekly review, it survived for only 37 issues, but by 9 July 1798, when the last of these appeared, its work was done.” (61)
“The Anti-Jacobin succeeded by being more Jacobinical than its enemies, by being itself so uncompromising that it successfully forced compromise on its opponents. The Jacobin was established as a compound beast, made up of impiety, lack of patriotism, profligacy, sentimentality, inhuman rationality, murderous violence, a character so Protean, adepts at assuming so many disguises, that it seemed monstrous even to the ‘Jacbobins’ themselves.” (69)
“Only two substantial Jacobin poems were published in 1798. One of them was Southey’s second edition of Joan of Arc, the other a poem of which Southey was the first and greatest admirer, Landor’s Gebir.” (74)
“Landor found the story of his poem in a translation from the French by Clara Reeves, ‘The History of Charoba, Queen of Egypt’, appended to her The Progress of Romance, a lengthy dialogue in which a pair of learned ladies defend, to the astonished admiration of their male adversary,the claim that prose fiction, the romance, should be granted a status equal to that of epic poetry. Landor, he tells us, came across the book ‘on the shelf of a circulating library’, and he affects a loftily dismissive response to it… But there is reason for suspecting that he was more receptive to Reeves’s argument than he finds it politic to admit.” (74)
“It is a Jacobin vision, and it concludes the last Jacobin poem to be published in England until Shelley was to reinvent a modified version of the kind some fifteen years later. Gebir is Jacobin in its internationalism, in a geographical sweep that takes the poem from the Iberian peninsula to Egypt, and then to the new western world, presumably America… it is Jacobin, too, in employing this internationalist rhetoric to articulate a condemnation of Britain in its war against France. It is Jacobin in its contempt of / royalty, in its fierce anti-militarism, and in maintaining the myth of an original, natural state of peaceful plenty, the birthright of all, until mankind was cheated of it by the machinations of warmongering kings. It it Jacobin in its distrust of the recalcitant prejudices of the ‘vulgar’, and in its desire to redraw the boundaries both of gender and of  genre. But by 1798 it was already a Jacobin poem written out of its time, and it carries the marks of its belatedness.” (79-80) “In part the poem suffers simply from the accident of its timing. It was unlucky to publish a poem that figured the English war against France by an Iberian invasion of Egypt at a time when Napoleon was about to sail for Egypt at the head of his army of occupation.” (80)
“The brave ambition of Jacobin poetry is to escape from history, like the French revolutionaries to rewrite the calendar so that time might begin again, all the distinctions that deformed the old world obliterated” (81)

Section Two
Chapter 4: Walter Scott and Anti-Gallican Minstrelsy
“Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means — the original two volumes of the Minstrelsy sold for a guinea. James Ballantyne’s printing of the volumes works in tandem with Scott’s editorial work to secure this effect. Typefaces elegantly distinguish the ballads from their editorial matter, and the ballads themselves are displayed with an opulent disregard for economy, no more than eighteen lines to the page, so that the 134 lines of ‘Johnnie Armstrong’ occupy eight pages of the first volume.” (94)
“By the time that Scott began to write the economic intregration of Scotland and England was well advanced. The publication history of Marmion itself serves to indicate this.” (105)

Funny quips
“Anyone offering yet another book on the politics of Romantic poetry might reasonably be asked to present a fairly convincing excuse.” (2)
“But then we read that Wordswoth’s ‘secondary’ period is ‘brief to the point of / non-existence’, because, at the date when Wordsworth ought to have begun writing secondary poems, 1808, he started to write bad poems instead.” (7-8)
“It is [Erasmus] Darwin’s treatment of gender and of sexuality that is most distinctive in his verse. His enthusiasm for breast-feeding is predictable enough, as is his hostility to mothers who are ‘bless’d in vain with timid bosoms’, and respond to the ‘tender wailings’ of their infants with ‘unfeeling ear’.” (36)</Text>

            <Text>“The more I listen to humanists working through data issues and challenges, I see a common tension arise:
1. We know that all data is a reductive construction
2. We also worry a lot about creating data that’s clean and
usable enough to share, which would seem to imply we’ve already compromised on point 1.” (Lincoln)

“Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz’s “Against Cleaning”, and the “Tidy Data” paper they cite by statistician Hadley Wickham. Although the former comes from a humanistic / librarian perspective, and the latter a statistical and programming perspective, I believe they are in fundamental agreement. … Wickham’s paper, published in the Journal of Statistical Software, has been fairly called a manifesto, as it strongly advocates for more attention towards the “mundane data manipulation chores” that precede any kind of analytical work. “Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a speciy a large number of queries against the data with much less effort than if they had been working with, for example, a word document transcribing the stock books into paragraphs. In this way, Wickham’s “tidy data” goes hand in hand with the deep questions that Rawson and Muñoz pose about the notion of “clean” data.” (Lincoln)

“I leaned on the word “tidy” in part due to Marie Kondo’s Tidying Up, newly popularized in the United States from the Netyour home, what matters most? Answering that question isn’t a prerequisite to starting to tidy - it’s an ongoing discovery that happens during the process of tidying.” (Lincoln)</Text>

            <Text>Research the EEBO thread of ESTC/ECCO

The history of the English Short-Title Catalog is long, as befits its enormous scope. “The English Short-Title Catalog (ESTC) is a vast database designed to include a bibliographic record, with holdings, of every surviving copy of letterpress produced in Great Britain or any of its dependencies, in any language, worldwide, from 1473-1800” (CBSR). Today, “The English Short-Title Catalogue is the most comprehensive record of what has appeared in print in Britain and the English-speaking world for all branches of human experience from the last quarter of the fifteenth century to the start of the nineteenth. More specialized studies exist for fields and eras within that span, but no other resource matches ESTC’s dependability over such a broad range” (Vander Meulen 265).
It began as the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue in the 1970s, operating in a similar line as the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640, which first appeared in 1926, and Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700, which appeared in 1951. These catalogues established the ambitious simplicity of the ESTC: to accurately describe every edition of every printed work in English or from the United Kingdom. After the completion of Wing’s STC, “[e]xploratory studies, poorly funded and inadequate though they were” (Korshin 209) throughout the 1950s and 60s pursued the feasibility of systematically accounting for the much larger body of printed work produced in the eighteenth century. The Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue began properly in 1976, at a conference jointly sponsored by the British Library and the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies (Crump 106). Here, “bibliographers and librarians attempted both to arrive at a consensus of the size of the task and the methodology that would have to be adopted to achieve a union catalogue. However, until the works were catalogued, it would not be possible to answer basic questions (such as the potential number of extant items) which would predetermine working methods. The very fact that they found it difficult to agree for want of sound and accepted figures indicated the need for ESTC.” (Crump 105). A pilot project began at the British Library in 1977, under the direction of Robin Alston (Crump 105).
Unlike earlier Short-Title Catalogues, which appeared as lengthly print publication, the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue was conceived as digital from the beginning — a decision which, as Karian notes, “exhibited considerable foresight” (283) in the 1970s. As a result, “ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work” (Karian 283).  Robin Alston and Mervyn Jannetta developed their own cataloguing rules, distinct from the Library of Congress MARC and UK MARC standards (Korshin 211). Once these standards were established, the British Library began to re-catalogue its own holdings, and in 1979 libraries in the United States, Germany, and Australia undertook to supplement them. In these international collaborations, “Where ESTC records already existed, these were adopted as the [new] record and only those works not held in the ESTC base file were catalogued again” (Crump 105). “One implication of the publication history of short-title catalogues is that they have been deemed functional and valuable even before they were complete. (That estimation is crucial, for their full completion is for all practical purposes impossible.) Judging that even a preliminary form of the records was useful to scholars, the planners of ESTC determined to conduct its development ‘in full public view’ and to make the incomplete file available ‘warts and all’ (in the words of Henry Snyder and Michael Crump, responding to criticism by Peter Blayney)” (Vander Meulen 270). Accordingly, the in-progress database “was soon available online, from 1980 via the British Library BLAISE [British LibraryAutomated Information SErvice] system and from 1981 in the US Research Libraries Group RLIN [Research Libraries Information Network] system” (Norman). Each of these databases was worked on locally by researchers, and then updated and reconciled with each other weekly.
To supplement these databases, accessible almost exclusively to librarians with specialized training in operating them and primarily used by the scholars compiling the file, the ESTC intended to publish editions at particular milestones of completeness, intended for the use of non-librarian scholars. Their “first step, a fiche catalogue of [the British Library’s] holdings, together with indexes, generated by the computer” (Crump 105) was published in a microform “snapshot” in 1983, but other milestones did not occur according to schedule. The “joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file ” (Korshin 212) which was expected to follow on microform in 1984 (Korshin 212) did not appear. Alston attributed the delays partly to the immensity of the task, and partly to the impact of short-term cost-cutting decisions, like the reduction of early-stage proofreading or of in-person examination of books, which dramatically increased the labour of verifying the resulting database record. Although he consistently warned “how easily strategic decisions based exclusively on cost usually lead to greater, not less, eventual costs” (Alston), the ESTC each year seemed to be facing a new budget struggle, and important maintenance labour was several times deferred. This created something like a paradox for the ESTC: funding bodies wanted to commit less money to a project which was behind schedule, but the project would remain behind schedule unless it was funded to complete the work required. 
Nonetheless, work continued, and in 1985, the online databases in RLIN and BLAISE were upgraded to allow dynamic updates to a single shared file (Crump 106), which for the first time allowed continuous access to a shared record, rather than the constant exchange and messy merging of individual partially-overlapping records. “Until the file was dynamically available online on RLIN in 1985 batch processing was a weekly nightmare” (Alston). At this time, it was hoped that the new RLIN file would “result in a more complete and coherent ‘first edition’ of ESTC” to be published in 1989 (Crump 106), though this deadline, too, was not met. In the mean time “the ESTC file [was] available to scholars on both BLAISE-LINE and on RLIN.” (Crump 106). To facilitate its use, the ESTC distributed “[a] simplified manual for searching the file on-line” (Crump 106). Crump took the opportunity of the update to rhapsodize on the database’s potential usefulness for other scholars: “No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page” (106). This valuable resource was not without cost. Although the manual on how to formulate search queries was free, use of the ESTC itself was notably not. Institutions or individuals paid to subscribe to the ESTC itself, paid per query for searches to be run, paid per minute for being connected to the database, and often paid for access to the computers they must use in their own libraries. Tabor says “the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing” (367).
“In 1987, with the agreement of the Bibliographical Society and the Modern Language Association of America, the International Committee approved the extension of the database to cover the period from the beginning of printing in the British Isles (ca. 1472) to 1700. The file changed its name to the 'English Short Title Catalogue', thereby keeping its well-known acronym. The USA team began cataloguing pre-1701 material in 1989, joined in the mid-1990s by the British Library team, and the resulting records were made available in the RLIN file from 1994.” (Norman). “In 1992, IESTC approved a further extension of the file to include serial publications. The USA team began work in 1994 on the cataloguing of serials within the scope of ESTC” (Norman). 
Concurrently with the development of the ESTC, Wing’s seventeenth-century STC was undergoing redevelopment into a second edition, overseen by Katharine Pantzer. The second edition of Wing’s STC was published in two volumes in 1976 and 1986, followed by a set of exhaustive indexes in 1991. This second edition “represented a vast development of the original” (Vander Meulen 268), incorporating thousands of new entries, expanding the titles, and adding explanatory notes and headnotes. Its completion in 1991 also marked the end of the ability of its publisher and sponsor, the Bibliographical Society, to support it (Vander Meulen 269). “Accordingly, in 1999 the Society made an agreement with ESTC whereby the latter… would assume official responsibility for receiving new STC data” (Vander Meulen 270). The ESTC continued to research new entries and improve existing ones, releasing a second edition of the file on CD-ROM in 1998 and a third edition in 2003 (Norman).
In 2006, almost thirty years after the commencement of the project, the ESTC underwent another major shift: the database was made publicly available to be searched for free online. This inspired more rhapsodizing, this time from Tabor: “The freeing of ESTC … now places in one location, for the consultation of anyone with internet access, the fullest and most up-to-date bibliographical account of ‘English’ printing” (367). At the same time, the ESTC began a project “to provide full title and imprint transcriptions for the eighteenth-century records” (Tabor 370). Vander Meulen says that “The history of ESTC is in fact the record of steady developments. Some have been conspicuous—for instance, the physical progression from a printed prototype to microfiche, CD, online access via the vendors Blaise Line and RLIN, and universal online availability through the British Library.” (Vander Meulen 270) Many more have been less visible, in constant improvements to the accuracy and detail of the records. In 2011, the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research at the University of California Riverside was awarded a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to “redesign the ESTC as a 21st century research tool” (“Planning Grant”), which was followed in 2013 by a larger two-year grant to execute software improvements to the ESTC.</Text>

            <Text>All my terms (seriousness, timelessness, etc) are reasons a work might be canonized — clarifies my interests by ‘zooming out’ to the framework of the canon
What is the print landscape of the 1790s actually like? As opposed to our filtered versions via academics, subsequent generations of writers
TL Cowan etc - how do you actually do recuperative/reparative work on archives
Looking at digital corpora the way that people look at anthologies, classroom teaching, etc; talk about why it’s important to know this, becase this is what we all refer to now
Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)
Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. (But stay away from seeing Romanticism as starting here; I’d have to do a lot of work to justify to scholars the beginning of Romanticism in the 1790s)
Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about celebrity and reprinting into this chapter)
Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft &amp; Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strageically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?
A lot of my questions aren’t quite about canons, they’re about ARCHIVES, which are related but without the idea of cultural capital; do our archives just reflect our canons? — Marisett - how the dewey decimal system systematically excludes african american authors of the 20thC — data production (of course it’s really all capta — the things you choose, and also the things that are made available for capture; shaped by choices and by constraints)
Is it even possible to get back to that initial moment before the archive formation began? I’m going to try! Undoing the misperception of what we begin with “before” the archive, and the perception of what is produced by DH

Who was actually printing what? Booksellers and print culture from a DH angle

Gothic: synthesize popular and political? Radical novels are often Gothic; but Gothic is also highly popular/mainstream. Not just a simple fusion of mass and racial media, but something there? Gothic as a mode or material that people want to have an inherent political content, but in fact it can be used for any agenda, it can be used for various forms… but there’s a lot that can’t be reshaped? Repackages radical themes to be mass accessible (melodrama?)? — Re-read Gary Kelley’s Jacobin Novel; something on melodrama

TITLE:  (1790s English) Print Politics in the Digital Archive

Map of the thesis at this stage:
	1.	Introduction: archive formation!
	2.	Comparison of digital corpora (write this first)
	3.	Ok, now how can I use these corpora to ask again what the print landscape of the 1790s actually looked like?
	⁃	Mainstream press?
	⁃	Radical press? Is it actually surreptitious/marginal?
[Something something the Gothic? (Will develop as the earlier parts develop) — but don’t put this in the proposal set]
TODO: Slot all the bits that I don’t want to lose into this new structure

Ongoing warning: I’m not trying to talk to undergrads, so I don’t need to debunk undergrad misperceptions. Read more secondary literature. Email Terry for books more often!

Mention that I am writing my own code, and that I think it’s crucial to read code and critique its algorithmic assumptions. Very explicit about methods. 2015 NSF report on reproducibility of research. My methods have to be able to explain how they are trustworthy.
(Put datasets in open access — T-space? Cultural Analytics?)
(Can generate a lot of words on methods section — but don’t bury in appendices? Instead put it in methods sections? 10,000 words, not 40,000 words. Remember that Terry is the audience.)

To read: Alan Liu — read his work on Romantic canonization; try to meet him? Him and the editors of Romantic Circles are the godfathers of DH and Romanticism. Just had one in PMLA about disjunction between DH and literary critics, how we frame questions and results
Stephen Berhrendt? Editor of Romantic Circles?

            <Title>proposal</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.</Text>

            <Synopsis> Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.

Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.</Synopsis>

            <Text>I am especially noticing as a major theme the desperate distress over the operation of "preposession" that I wrote about as an undergrgrad -- I think I was onto something there! Should I foreground "preposession" further, and its relationship to the political philosophy of the day? It definitely seems connected to tyranny -- Even in More's history of Mary Woods, evidence and testimony are utterly useless and the vulnerable have no recourse when subjected to tyranny based in prepossession.

            <Title>ch 4 - chapbook sales</Title>
            <Text>My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see how much we do know about the chapbook trade. I am particularly interested in the cycle of responses between pamphlets, and whether there are geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness. This chapter will of course address Hannah More’s Cheap Repository Tracts, but I am equally curious about the works among which hers were sold. My “case study” could trace the printing and circulation of one of More’s pamphlets and a few of its fellow-travellers, as the foundation for a discussion of More’s hybrid literary forms. </Text>

Consequently, / every search run on EEBO (with some exceptions) relies, in a fundamental sense, on bibliographical information originally supplied by ESTC – but not in the form that one might expect. First, EEBO heavily edited ESTC’s data for its own purposes: certain categories of data were removed (e.g. collations, Stationers’ Register entrances), some information was amended (e.g. subject headings), and some was added (e.g. microfilm- specific details). Second, there is no formal mechanism for synchronising the data between the two resources. Occasionally, snapshots of data are sent by EEBO to ESTC but there is no guarantee that a correction or revision made to an ESTC entry will be replicated in the corresponding EEBO entry or vice versa: neither ESTC nor EEBO will necessarily know when the other has made a correction. As both resources continue to amend and expand their bibliographical data for their own purposes, there is an increasing likelihood of significant discrepancy between the two resources. Finally, although EEBO continues to microfilm and digitise, there is no absolute one-to-one correspondence between the pre-1701 entries in ESTC and the materials on EEBO; there are – and will always be – items on ESTC not available on EEBO.” (Gadd 685-6)</Text>

            <Title>STAR</Title>
            <Text>The ESTC is not actually only one database: “The STAR file, maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. … In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC’s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.” (Tabor 373) There are two kinds of information, in particular, which the STAR file contains and which is concealed from ESTC users: the true ‘verified’ status of individual edition matches, and edition-specific notes on known errors.
A “match” in the ESTC is a known copy of a book held in a library which serves as a representative of a particular edition. A match can be encoded as “verified” when an ESTC staff member consults the book to confirm that it corresponds to the edition in question, or “unverified” when this has not happened. But the STAR copy contains two additional verification statuses: when a contributor such as a librarian or a scholar submits a match, it is coded as a “web match.” “Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the ‘verified’ and ‘unverified’ levels” (Tabor 374). Automated uploads of various outside databases can also generate new matches, encoded as “catalogue matches;” these “have a comparatively low level of reliability” (Tabor 374). However, in the transition from STAR to ESTC, “The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to ‘verified’. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt” (374).

            <Title>capta</Title>
            <Text>My attention to the sources of digital knowledge creation comes, in part, from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” Drucker, in “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” specifically addresses the digital humanities practice of creating, and then close reading, data visualizations. She argues that the tools for visual representation which may be effective in the sciences cannot be simply and uncritically transposed to humanistic subject matter. When an experiment is presented as a ‘data visualization,’ she says, “the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework” (8). In fields where the readers of such charts are also frequent creators of charts, and where norms exist to explicitly describe one’s interpretive frameworks in a methodology section, the simplicity and legibility of an individual chart may be a benefit which does not impede complex scrutiny of the information it presents. In a field like literature, however, the “graphical force” of something like a network graph or even a simple pie chart “conceals what the statistician knows very well — that no ‘data’ preexist their parameterization” (8). Drucker problematizes the term “data,” the etymology of which presents it as a “given” which is stable and independent of observation. She proposes that humanities visualizations embrace, instead, the framework of “capta,” that which is “‘taken’ actively” (3), “fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena” (50). Drucker’s assessment shapes my own prioritization of qualitative and reflective computational research. The term “capta” itself has not seen uptake in subsequent digital humanities scholarship, even in cases where scholars explicitly take Drucker’s warnings to heart. Accordingly, for clarity, this dissertation will continue to use the more usual term “data” to refer to the information gathered for analysis here. However, as I integrate and compare a wide variety of data from many disparate sources, a preliminary task of my analysis is always to determine, as precisely as possible, how the information was captured and quantified. </Text>
            <Comments>It may also be the case, of course, that even fields with a long history of graphical display would benefit from greater scrutiny of the evidence they use; see: the Data Dinosaur. But this is beyond the remit of what an English PhD can address.</Comments>

            <Title>Lesser &amp; Farmer debate</Title>
            <Text>A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer &amp; Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.”

Blayney believes that Lesser &amp; Farmer attempt to disprove his “one inescapable fact about printed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been” (7). But what really matters to him about identifying the “best-selling moneyspinners” of the day is not the ‘moneyspinning’ — the question of whether, when a publisher bought a play, he was making a sound financial decision — but about the cultural centrality of ‘bestsellers’. The total market share of religious texts matters, not because it meant that publishers turned their highest profits off of religious texts, but because “[c]ustomers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other ‘literary’ publications,” evidence of “just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers” (7). Lesser and Farmer do not contradict the importance of religious texts to readers. But, in setting out “not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (F&amp;L 213), they make the case that books with low market share, books that are not “best-selling,” could nonetheless be “moneyspinners.” Their rebuttal states that “...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low” (F&amp;L 213), but what they leave somewhat unstated is: “in high demand” with whom?

My own work seeks to examine reprints, but in a more limited fashion than Farmer &amp; Lesser were able to do. Rather than determine the reprint rate of various kinds of fiction, I carry out a Blayney-style examination of pure market share. I seek to identify reprints in order to determine the market share of new versus reprinted material in any given year. </Text>

            <Text>In the following chapters, this dissertation weaves together an exploration of 1790s literature with an exploration of contemporary digital resources. As described in more detail above, chapter two uses Charlotte Smith to introduce the core differences between the databases under consideration, and to examine our conceptions of editions and reprinting. Chapter three uses Mary Robinson, whose printed output is expected to be largely similar in bibliographic terms to Smith’s (that is, they both consist of a large number of publications in a wide range of genres, which were successful enough to sustain a career as a writer), to examine questions about authorship and reception. Chapter four introduces an author who provides a contrast to both Smith and Robinson by producing a small number of titles in only one genre, Ann Radcliffe, prompting deeper inquiry into print runs and reviews, to develop richer metrics for “popularity” or “importance.” Chapter five introduces another contrasting author, of the opposing type, Hannah More, whose large number of publications at varied price points presents a technical challenge for the tools I have developed, and also a theoretical challenge for the concepts of literature I explore. A brief conclusion synthesizes my findings on these four authors, and presents my assessment of how they relate to 1790s literature as a whole.</Text>

The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.</Text>

            <Text>KEY CONCLUSIONS
	•	“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
	•	“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)
	⁃	“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education … as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (329-330)
	•	“The most politically strategic argument for revising the canon remains the argument that the works so revalued are important and valuable cultural works. If literary critics are not yet in a position to recognize the inevitability of the social practice of judgment, that is a measure of how far the critique of the canon still is from developing a sociology of judgment. The theory of cultural capital elaborated in this book is an attempt to construct just such a sociology.” (Xiv)
	•	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming." (340)
	⁃	Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
	•	“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)
	•	“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)


Preface
	•	“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The "means" in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)
	⁃	“The literary syllabus is the institutional form by means of which this knowledge is disseminated, and it constitutes capital in two senses: First, it is linguistic capital, the means by which one attains to a socially credentialed and therefore valued speech” (ix)
	⁃	“And second, it is symbolic capital, a kind of knowledge-capital whose possession can be displayed upon request and which thereby entitles its possessor to the cultural and material rewards of the well-educated person.” (Ix)
	•	“I will argue that evaluative judgments are the necessary but not sufficient condition for the process of canon formation, and that it is only by understanding the social function and institutional protocols of the school that we will understand how works are preserved, reproduced, and disseminated over successive generations and centuries. Similarly, where the debate speaks about the canon as representing or failing to represent particular social groups, I will speak of the school's historical function of distributing, or regulating access to, the forms of cultural capital.” (Vii)
	•	“The theory of cultural capital implies that the proper social context for analyzing the school and its literary curriculum is class.” (Viii)
	•	“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)

Chapter 1
	•	Establishes the flaws in the current canon debate:
	⁃	A focus on “representation” as if literary representation was equivalent to political representation
	⁃	Essentialist assumptions of liberal pluralism
	⁃	“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
	⁃	The “exclusion” hypothesis
	⁃	“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon.” (16)
	•	The “decline of the humanities” is the reduction of literature’s cultural capital
	⁃	“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)
	⁃	university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
	•	The actual function of the canon: "The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
	⁃	the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
	⁃	revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
	⁃	revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)
	⁃	"An individual's judgment that a work is great does nothing in itself to preserve that work, unless that judgment is made in a certain institutional context, a setting in which it is possible to insure the reproduction of the work, its continual reintroduction to generations of readers.” (28)
	•	How to ‘open’ the canon:
	⁃	Must necessarily modernize it
	⁃	Present “minority works” as valuable literary history, not “representation” or subversion
	⁃	“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works [by minorities] because they are important and significant cultural works. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
	⁃	But really, the goal is to address unequal access to cultural capital

Chapter 2
	•	“The context of the first case study is the institution of a vernacular literary curriculum in the primary schools of the eighteenth century.” (X)
	⁃	"The fact of increased upward mobility is at once the premise of ‘bourgeois ideology' -- that anyone can succeed -- and its prime source of social anxiety. … there must be neither too little nor too much social mobility.” (95)
	⁃	“since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless’ knowledge comes to stand… as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent." (96-97) "This ambivalence... is ultimately resolved with the entry of vernacular literature into the new, middle-class schools. The study of vernacular literature is thus at first a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97)
	•	18thC: Serious vs popular is the new high vs low
	⁃	Previously, poetry was high and prose was low. If some prose has cultural capital now, how can we avoid having ALL prose be high literature? Make the distinction somewhere other than its basic form
	⁃	“the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel. Wordsworth and Coleridge responded to this crisis with a programmatic attempt to reaffirm the High Cultural status of traditional canonical works in English against, on the one hand, popular novels and narrative poetry, and, on the other, the quasi-Latinate "poetic diction" supposed to have characterized especially the work of Gray. The effect of that program, which was of course shared by a literary culture much larger than the circle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was to reserve the term "literature" for High Canonical works, and in this way to maintain the cultural capital of those works.”” (Xi)
	•	what now distinguishes "serious" literature from “popular" literature is its penetration into the school system: reserving a work until higher in the school hierarchy is what grants it higher status (133)
	⁃	the school "as the site at which social mobility is choked off" (95) -- the poor should be actively deprived of education in order to minimize too much mobility
Chapter 3
	•	“I have constructed the second case study around a moment in which the vernacular curriculum in the university became strongly distinguished from the curriculum in the primary and secondary levels. This was the moment of the great canonical reformation of the New Critics.” (Xi)
	•	Leavis and New Critics both want literature to create a ‘literary sensibility’ in people, as the new ‘doxa’
	⁃	even though Leavis and New Critics had different ideological values, they could agree on canon reassessment because "the two movements could be seen to provide different solutions to the same social or cultural problems.” (135)
	⁃	“literature itself can be installed as a sensibility that performs the social function of doxa— producing a state of cultural homogeneity, or unquestioned belief-- without ever requiring the 'imperfect' supplement of orthodoxy, without specifying directly what these beliefs are. Precisely because sensibility is not the same thing as belief, it is never subject to decay into mere orthodoxy." (138)
	•	However, literature actually became less important, relegated to schools
	⁃	“The school becomes the site at which the practice of reading can be cultivated in such a way as to preserve the cultural capital of literature (signified in the Brooksian allegory as a kind of sacredness), just because its social space can be conceived as a space of deliberate and strategic withdrawal, as the withdrawal of literary culture from 'the world’” (165)
	⁃	This involved a new positive valuation of “difficulty,” as the marker of real literature
	⁃	“In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, these new students also discovered at the same moment why it needed to be studied in the university” (172)
	⁃	“Literature... presents a united front, in the form of its intrinsic difficulty, against the artifacts of mass culture” (173)
	•	Literature retained its high reputation even as it lost relevance
	⁃	“Therein lies the peculiar power of mass culture, since the waning cultural centrality of literary works in the face of new mass cultural forms never entailed a denial of the nominally superior value of literature” -- readers of mass media “would no doubt have concede the cultural superiority of literature, whether or not [they] ever felt inclined to read any works so designated" (173)
	⁃	“the mass culture of modernity never coveted the institutional space to which literary culture retreated" -- uni students dutifully studied &amp; accepted the value of literature but “continued to consume both kinds of artifacts in the distinct spheres of their consumption" (174)
	⁃	“The capacity to experience the social space of the schools and the social space of mass culture as disjunct effectively institutionalized two modes of consumption, one consequence of which was to make literary works more difficult to consume outside the school." (174)
	⁃	“The effect of New Critical pedagogy was rather to produce a kind of recusant literary culture, at once faithful to the quasi-sacred authority of literature but paying tribute at the same time to the secular authority of a derogated mass culture. For the recusants the artifact of mass culture might be consumed with a certain guilt, or a certain relief; but for those whose allegiance was sworn to secular authority, that culture provided everything there was to consume." (175)
Chapter 4
	•	There has also been a canon reformation in grad school, with the new syllabus of ‘theory’
	⁃	“Chapter 4 turns to the highest level of the educational system, the graduate school, where in the last twenty-five years the literary syllabus has been supplemented by a list of texts which effectively circulate as a "canon of theory."” (Xii)
	⁃	“The names which circulate as ‘theory' in this canonical sense are actually very few in number, much more restricted a list than that which constitutes ‘canonical' literary work. Furthermore the very canonical organization of these texts, their recategorization as 'theory', has the effect of neutralizing the generic, disciplinary, and ideological differences between them in much the same way that the literary canon tends to define all canonical literary texts as the embodiment of a single quality of 'literariness’.” (203)
	⁃		“what unifies the syllabus which includes (among others) Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, or Nietzche, Freud, Saussure, and Heidegger, is the fact that these oeuvres can be taken to embody a discourse of mastery, which is always by definition an imitable discourse." (203)
	⁃	theory introduces to grad pedagogy "a syllabus whose symptomatic function is to signify precisely methodological 'rigor,' rather than the taste or discrimination which for so long determined the ideological protocols of literary criticism.” (260)
	•	Theory is a response to the irrelevance of literature
	⁃	schools used to be tasked with "the impossible task of at once democratizing the distribution of knowledges and maintaining class distinctions" but now "the nation-state…no longer requires that a distinctive practice of … language identify a culturally homogenous bourgeoisie. That class has long since been replaced by a culturally heterogenous New Class” (263)
	⁃	“the hegemony of that technobureaucratic organization of intellectual life which has rendered the literary curriculum socially marginal by transforming the university into the institution designed to produce a new class of technical/managerial specialists possessed of purely technical/managerial knowledge." (261)
	⁃	“the reconstruction of criticism as a ‘technical' practice revealed the intrinsic inadequacy of the literary syllabus as the object of that intellectual labor; hence the ‘rigor' of theory had to be embodied not in literary works but in the philosophical or other nonliterary texts supplementing that syllabus. It is these works, the 'canon of theory,' which signify rigor." (181)
	⁃	“The increasingly technobureaucratic organization of the professional field of literary criticism was a condition for the emergence of theory, which we can understand in retrospect as the reassertion of charismatic authority in the face of that technobureaucratic domination." (256)
	⁃	He has a lot to say about ‘transference’ in the pedagogy of Lacan and de Man. “Lacan and de Man appear to set off resolutely on opposite theoretical directions, but ... they end up in the same place, the place of the ‘the subject who is supposed to know.’” (195)
	•	“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)

Chapter 5
	•	The history of “aesthetic value” as a concept, as it emerged in 18thC ‘moral philosopgy’ debates on aesthetics and economics
	⁃	"the practice of judging works of art need make no reference at all to the concept of value before the emergence of political economy… the comparison of authors or works to one another need not at that time be expressed as the comparison of their relative 'aesthetic values,' because neither the concept of the aesthetic, nor the concept of value, are as yet defined in such a way that they can be yoked together.” (303)
	⁃	“the market is the historical /condition/ and not merely the proper analogy for the extension of the value-concept to all acts of judgment." (324)
	•	“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
	⁃	“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education” (329-330)
	⁃	"as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (330)
	⁃	"To say that the aesthetic disposition determines the relative cultural capital granted to any particular work is to say that the act of judgment is the assignment, or even the recognition, of cultural capital. Judgment is the act by which the aesthetic disposition expresses or externalizes itself, according to criteria which are relatively internalized, that is, neither capable of being fully rationalized, nor materially caused in the manner of a biological predisposition.” (332)
	•	Actual aesthetics (as distinct from ‘aesthetic value’) are, necessarily, everywhere
	⁃	“the largest effect of the discourse of canonicity: the illusion that aesthetic experience is really restricted to the experience of High Cultural works." (336)
	⁃	“As Michael Denning has recently reminded us, there are innumerable examples in working-class cultural forms of formal experiment and variation; it is precisely the experience of formal innovation which engages interest and admiration in these consumers, even though such manifestly aesthetic experience... may fail to be recognized as aesthetic.” (336)
	⁃	"The recognition of cultural capital, otherwise known as aesthetic judgment, must deny, as a condition of its exercise, the ubiquity of aesthetic experience, the fact that such experience utterly pervades the field of cultural production." (336)
	•	We must actually reform access.
	⁃	Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
	⁃	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)
	•	Then, works will still compete, but differently.
	⁃	“The idea of production for the producers (which by definition entails /consumption/ by the producers) projects onto a utopian screen the disarticulation of cultural capital from the system of class formation, and thus from ‘distinction' based on inequality of access to cultural goods. Bourdieu calls this condition 'total autonomy from the laws of the market.' Such a condition does not, however, prophesy the disappearance of cultural capital. The universalization of restricted production would rather transform cultural capital into pure 'symbolic distinction.’” (339)
	⁃	“Even were such an educational system no longer to regulate access to cultural capital in the grotesquely unequal way it presently does, cultural producers would still compete to have their products read, studied, looked at, heard, lived in, sung, worn, and would still accumulate cultural capital in the form of 'prestige’ or fame. But social distinctions reinstated on such an aesthetic basis would have to be expressed in social relations as distinctions in ‘lifestyle,' in other words a vast enlargement of the field of aesthetic judgment." (339)
	⁃	“What we call canon formation would then become a much larger part of social life, because not restricted to the institutions of the materially advantaged.” (339)

            <Text>Review Reviewed Work(s): Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation by John Guillory Review by: David Punter Source: The Yearbook of English Studies, Vol. 25, Non-Standard Englishes and the New Media Special Number (1995), pp. 229-230 Published by: Modern Humanities Research Association Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3508832 Accessed: 01-06-2019 21:45 UTC 


“John Guillory sets out to describe aspects of the formation of the literary canon within a specific theoretical framework, which he develops as the book foes on. His essential argument is aimed against the notion that the canon can be seen as typified by specific inclusions and exclusions; this, he says, is ot see it as bodelled too closely on social formations and to confuse different meanings of the term ‘representation.’ Instead, he presents us with a more materialist account, owing a great deal to Bourdieu, which connects the canon directly with issues of literacy and which offers as as its crucial site the 'school’.” (Punter 229)
“This argument is advanced in five stages. First, Guillory offers a summary of the current debate about canonicity and non-canonicity, an account which is devoted principally, and rightly, to pointing up the incoherence of much current thinking on the topic. After this he moves to three 'case studies' in what one can only call canonization: the institution of a vernacular canon in the eighteenth century; the canonical changes inaugurated by the rise and dominance of the New Criticism / in the universities; the appearance and consolidation of a 'canon of theory' over the last decades. Finally he turns to a series of reflections on the question of value, a question which has clearly been latent in his argument from the beginning.” (Punter 229-230)
Critique: not specific enough about “the school,” esp its national context
“We may, as Guillory contends, be in 'the twilight years of theory', a phrase with an oddly post-romantic flavour, but I am not convinced that his book makes a real contribution to thinking us through these years: we know, of course, that literacy is a crucial social weapon, but what we do not know, and what Guillory appears not to know either, is what we do about this dangerous but politically useless knowledge.We know also that canonicity is all too dependent on specific notions of the 'master' and that 'theory' has all too frequently intensified this nexus of suspect relationship and thus of monolithism within the institutions; but what the conditions would be for a wider distribution of authority within the domain of literacy remains a puzzle.A puzzle honourable to perceive, indeed, and honourably worked at; but I did not feel that the parts of this book, excellent as some of them are, added up to a wholewhich could mobilize a countervailing force of the strength Guillory himself says would be necessary against the forces of recapitulation which, as he also rightly says, currently govern the processes of canon formation and act, by ignoring the real and complex psychodynamics of the pedagogic, to purge the field of any trace of the subversive.” (Punter 230)</Text>

            <Text>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hinderance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination, and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</Text>

            <Text>“The preceding chapter argues that there can be no /general/ theory of canon formation that would predict or account for the canonization of any particular work, without specifying first the unique historical conditions of that work's production and reception. Neither the social identity of the author for the work's proclaimed or tacit ideological messages definitively explain canonical status. If this were not true, ideologically heterodox works would never achieve canonicity, nor would writing produced by any member of a socially defined minority.” (85) It's the “task of the school, not of works themselves" to assimilate a range of works. (85)

“raises an interesting question about the actual relation between the ideological contents of particular literary works and the immediate historical circumstances of their canonization.” (85)

this chapter will look at Gray's elegy to examine "the moment at which the vernacular English canon enters the school system as a literary curriculum in competition with the classical curriculum" -- and as a work which raises the question of canons &amp; how to value noncaonical works (via the unidscovered "gem”) (86)
Gray's elegy had substantial "linguistic capital” -- "rapidly established itself in the school system as a perfect poem for introducing schoolchildren to the study of English literature” (86)
“impression of an immediate but sophisticated accessibility” -- a sense that it is all made up of familiar poetic phrases — due to the 'commonplace book’  (87)

“the commonplace book had to be discarded as a matrix of composition in order for the Romantic locodescriptive lyric to set itself against the rhetorical commonplace" (88)
the poem's sentiments are not original but commonplace; it's the poem's "tone" which makes them effective and powerful (91)
"The affect of complacence is produced... by the relation of the commonplace... to the ‘universality and impersonality’ of the style. I would like to propose that this style is produced by the /systematic linguistic normalization of quotation/“ (92)
"The cento of quotable quotations which /is/ the poem thus generates a reception-scenario characterized by the reader's pleased recognition that 'this is my truth,' while at the same time concealing the fact that this pleasure is founded on the subliminal recognition that 'this is my language.’” (92)
the lack of class mobility is “stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it. ... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that the man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities. ... Many people, without being communists, have been irritated by the complacence in the massive calm of the poem, and this seems partly because they feel there is a cheat in the implied politics” (Empson 4-5, qtd in Guillory 94)
"The fact of increased upward mobility is at once the premise of ‘bourgeois ideology' -- that anyone can succeed -- and its prime source of social anxiety. … there must be neither too little nor too much social mobility.” (95)
the school "as the site at which social mobility is choked off" (95) -- the poor should be actively deprived of education in order to minimize too much mobility
“since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless’ knowledge comes to stand… as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent." (96-97)
"This ambivalence... is ultimately resolved with the entry of vernacular literature into the new, middle-class schools. The study of vernacular literature is thus at first a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97)
“the impetus behind the / standardization of speech does not come from the landed nobility but from a much wider and more heterogeneous group, which is beginning to recognize itself not as other than aristocratic but as part of a society of ‘gentlemen,’ defined according to norms of behavior and education rather than blood” (98)
"the bourgeoisie comes to know itself ... as the speakers of a national language. Until that imagined community comes to be, the 'polite language' of earlier eighteenth-century literary culture continues to embody a confusion of aristocratic and bourgeois cultural norms, and an ambivalence in the relation of vernacular to classical literacy. (99)
The trajectory sketched here is intended to make sense of one moment in that history of literary canon formation to which Gray's /Elegy/ belongs” (99)
"This moment is virtually the last moment at which literary culture can sustain a discourse of polite letters in the vernacular without establishing this discourse in the schools. And it is virtually the last moment at which polite speech can easily be assimilated to the concept of the gentleman as aristocrat, and therefore to a class structure simply divided into aristocracy and commons.” (99)
“the event (in the 1740s and 1750s) which transforms English literary culture: the passage of English vernacular texts into the schools" (99) -- at the time the poems was written (written 1750, pub 1751)
“Just as the late medieval nobility acquired literacy but did not care to master the scholastic canon of the clergy, the middling sort wished to acquire polite speech but not necessarily a knowledge of Latin or Greek." (100)
"The anxiety expressed by Sheridan is that, in the absence of an institutional form of dissemination, literary culture cannot be entrusted to preserve English works of the past; vernacular works must be revalued as equal in value to classical works and therefore worthy to be taught in the schools. This is the crucial point: the judgment of vernacular works throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries already elevates some works over others, but only the institutionalization of these works as a curriculum can revalue their cultural capital as the equal of the classics.” (101)
DISAGREEMENT: “The absurdity of such a hypothetical departure from the meditative narrative [i.e., the impossibility of imagining the solitary teaching peasants to read] measures the peculiar force of a complex effect by which it is possible for reader to identify with / either the state of privilege or the state of deprivation, to indulge in the pathos of sympathy or the ethos of resentment.” (102-3) -- but I think the reader can always do that anyway
“Gray's poem... is followed by a poem enitled ‘Warrington Academy,' by one 'Mrs. Barbauld,' a writer no one would regard today as canonical. The adjacency of so titled a poem to Gray's call attention either to itself or to Gray, or to both." (103) No -- I don't think it CALLS attention to anything, though it might REWARD attention. Also weird that he dismisses Barbauld as if I've never heard of her, even though I totally have; she's still in the anthologies. I guess the feminists put her back in the 90s?
"Barbauld was very much in the vanguard, then, of that anthologizing movement by which English literature was given a canonical form. In this context the pendant position of ‘Warrington Academy' in relation to Gray's poem is, as we may now demonstrate, not at all accidental: Barbauld's poem reads Gray's /Elegy/ and so enacts its reception.” (104) DISAGREE - could be completely accidental, or placed because it, too, describes a place.

“Behind the generic veil certain social facts come sharply into focus: the struggle of individuals and social groups to rise. Gray's peasants of course do not struggle. Barbauld's word for the social fact she firmly grasps is "emulation,” which here has all of the senses to which I have assigned it, preeminently ‘to compete by imitiation.’" (104)
“The important point here is that the opening lines express the fact of struggle through a rhetoric of literary culture; that culture is where the struggle takes place.” (104)
“Gray's landscape contains no historical social institutions, no historical aristocrats or peasants, and that is just the point of it. It is a landscape of abstract repression: ‘Penury' represses 'rage’.” -- this contrasts with Barbauld critiquing laws that blocked Dissenters from schools. (106)
“Barbauld reads into Gray's poem, then, the immediate circumstances of her own literary production, the very conditions that bring Warrington Academy into existence. Her reading discovers at the same time what is really there in the Elegy -- an absence of reference, a structure of abstract repression, which Empson makes concrete once again by specifying that absence as the absence of a 'scholarship system,' the /carrie(accent \)re ouverte aux talents./” (107)
Gray seems to resolve his irony by turning to death -- compared to death, “the social repression that produces material inequality dwindles to insignificance” (107) -- but Guillory isn't fully convinced: “critics have often been able to assert that the poem is about death only by asserting it is not about something else" (107)
"The invocation of death is the rhetorical mechanism by which the social structure of repression is /abstracted/, rendered subjectless and objectless … allowing us to forget that their actual lives are foreshortened by poverty and not by death" (108) -- hm, but do we have to?
Gray only observes foreshortened potential in dead peasants, not living ones nearby (108)
he gets psychoanalytic about the flower's ‘blush' --  “The attempt to keep down or repress a sexual passion takes over from 'Chill Penury' the job of repression, and so converts a social into a psychic repression." (109)
"The great ones… can sin without blushing. The poor may desire what the wealthy and ambitious desire, but they blush with shame… and as a consequence they can be approved for pursuing 'the noiseless tenour of their way’” (110)
"a curious equation between social and /literary/ ambition. It is in this sense that the poem meditates on the process of what we call canon formation" (110) and deems "the very conditions enabling literary production" to actually be “morally inferior to the conditions which /constrain/ production” (111).
“All evocations of violence in the poem are tendentially assimilated to the motive of ambition" (111)
“we need to ask what Gray means when he substitutes Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell for Cato, Tully, and Caesar in the published version of lines 57-60. For that 'translation' into the vernacular finally locates 'Ambition' in /literary culture/, where the shrine of ‘Luxury and Pride’ is heaped with 'incense kindled at the Muse’s flame.’" (111) -- connecting Milton with Hampden and Cromwell ties literary production to an ambitious ethos
“The hypothetical achievements of the peasantry can be represented in the poem as at once tragically repressed; but on the other hand, no achievements are named in the poem which are not deplored as instances of Ambition, Luxury, and pride: hence Milton is flanked by Hampden and Cromwell.” (112)
“the proposition that the noble makes a better peasant than a peasant. ... The poem does not really address the peasantry. While the noble habitus can be represented by the imperturbably and natural nobility of literary peasants, these peasants cannot at the same time be represented as miserably impoverished. The peasants, in other words, cannot be both literary and real peasants.” (113)
I'm confused -- there's no difference between the manuscript and the published version but he quotes as if there was. (113)
"The poem discovers this melancholy subject as the solution to its intractable problems, and hence the specular eye of the first stanza is refashioned in the final version into the pastoral poet who so oddly languishes in the countryside" (114)
“what characterizes the melancholy poet of the later stanzas is not simply acquiescence in, or resentment against, the frustration of ambition, but the contradiction between emulation (or ambition) and its systematic self-repression." (114)
“the construction of the melancholy poet as both subject and object of writing reorients the process of repression to bring to the fore the relation between literary fame and obscurity, while allowing the relation of wealth and poverty to recede into the background. The imagined death of the poet functions obviously enough as the repressive agency producing resignation to obscurity as a metonymic corrollary of resignation to death” (115)
“Gray does not, as does Milton, express directly a fear of death. On the contrary, death is the signifier of an attractive self-repression (self-burial), an almost successful repression of a subject who yet leaves behind the trace of his repression in the form of a somewhat lengthy epitaph." (116)
"The figure of the solitary expresses ambivalence about the emergence of the public sphere, but that expression itself belongs to the public sphere by virtue of being literary, by virtue of being /published/" (117)
“such a strategy scarcely makes sense for either the aristocratic or the peasant writer” (117) -- which strategy? "fetishizing the ignorance of the peasant as a king of covert nobility” (117) ?
“The emergence of a 'common reader,' a literary ‘public,' was by no means universally welcome; it could be actively resisted as a process of cultural /degeneration/." (118)
“the redistribution of cultural capital is in a very real sense a revolutionary process. If the cultural capital represented by vernacular literacy signifies to some social groups the possibility of upward mobility, it can also signify the devaluation of the cultural capital possessed by other individuals or groups.” (118)
“In Gray's famous ambivalence about publication, one sees how it is possible for polite letters to react /against itself/. ... The cultural capital which in its 'public' place becomes the means of upward mobility thus reappears within Gray's literary landscape as the occasion for a kind of vertiginous homelessness, for the dislocation of the melancholy poet who imaginarily identifies with the displaced aristocrat of Renaissance pastoral." (118)
“imitative social behaviors expressed most conspicuously, of course, by Gray's disdain for publication, as though he still belonged to a manuscript culture of courtly poets, but also by his disinclination to accept money for his poems, even though Dodsley, his publisher, made large sums printing them." (119)
"The moment we are examining under high magnification here can be described in the terms formulated by Raymond Williams as a complex overlapping of 'residual' and 'emergent’ cultural formations." (119)
Elegy was popular, which Gray disliked, in part because it was unusually comprehensible compared to his other poems (120)
“The Elegy is thus at once peculiarly accessible to a wide reading public at the same time that its narrative reinscribes this access as innate rather than acquired. ... The cultural entitlement that for Gray is defined by classical literacy, by his immense learning, is thus acquired by his readers at a /discount/, at the cost only of acquiring the vernacular literacy requisite to reading the poem." (121)
elision of poetry and prose puts entire English canon in question, since "in the two previous centuries, all literature was poetry and only poetry was literature" (121)
18thC prose, unlike Renaissance prose, eschewed "neologism, archaism, complex figuration, and foreign borrowing,” defined itself as being "a normalized language” (121) -- raising the stakes of prose and poetry merging
"It is the emergence of vernacular literacy which brings the category of 'literature' to the forefront of the public sphere, and names the 'man of letters' as its producer." (123)
“canonical /forms/, the categories of textual appropriation and reproduction in their institutional sites, operate as mechanisms of selection before individuals exercise judgments, of whatever kind." (123) *** VERY IMPORTANT -- explains, e.g., novels as noncanonical bc female, as well as lower survival rates of smaller books in ESTC
“The problem of poetic diction is, after all, the problem of the cultural /distinction/ of poetry, and in that sense the argument for poetic diction argues for the greater cultural capital of poetic forms within the forms of writing. If the very capaciousness of eighteenth-century 'literature’ implicitly privileged the language of prose, Gray responded to that development by reworking the vernacular precisely in order to /estrange it from itself/, to invent a kind of vernacular Latin. But this is also a question of whether and how literature comes to estranged from the vernacular reading public, whose passion for novels calls into question the traditional hierarchy of literary forms and genres. This is a question which I should like to approach now by considering Wordsworth's critique of Gray's poetic diction, and Coleridge's response to that critique." (124)
"the return of the pastoral in the later eighteenth century makes it possible to reground normative linguistic practice in what is thought to be the /actual/ language of the peasantry.” (126)
“The literalization of pastoral speech is thus an unacknowledged idealization of the bourgeois sociolect; only in this context does Wordsworth's turn to such a simplified speech in the Preface to Lyrical Ballads appear to be something other than a mysterious and total rupsture with eighteenth-century practice.” (126)
“despite the claims of his theory, Wordsworth's poetic practice was scarcely anomalous in its literary milieu. Wordsworth himself, in the Advertisement to the 1798 Lyrical Ballads, invokes the models of Burns and Cowper.” (126)
Wordsworth, like Gray, presents “the socially distinct character of the poet threatened with effacement of obscurity in the very identification of his language with the language of the rustics” -- fear of failure of social distinction (128)
“while the mythology of the poetic character has an obvious social force, it is only the force lent it by the preexistent social distinction between aristocrat and commoner.” (129)
the fact that we need a new explanation for what distinguishes poetry from prose shows that "the generic difference between poetry and prose have already been seriously eroded" (129)
“Wordsworth's earlier poetry is in retrospect generically homogenous with the poems of Cowper or Campbell, and the real generic break occurs with the Gothicized poetic narratives of Scott and Byron.” (129)
"For the first time poetic genres and prose genres are comparable as /literary/ genres; this point is immediately evident when we consider how difficult it is in the eighteenth century to conceptualize prose genres at all." (129)
“genres had always historically been categories of poetics: the earliest classical genres were simply distinctions between kinds of meter" (130)
"Wordsworth's embrace of prose as the language really spoken by men represents a compromise between his distaste of a clichéd poetic diction and his disdain for the taste of the public that neglects canonical works in favor of ephemeral novels, plays, and novel-like narrative poems” (130)
the distinction between 'serious' prose and 'popular' prose is a new form of the high/low culture schism, because unlike poems vs ballads, the forms of prose are the same form (131)
what now distinguishes "serious" literature from “popular" literature is its penetration into the school system: reserving a work until higher in the school hierarchy is what grants it higher status (133)

“In retrospect we can say that the virtual indifference of poetic and prose diction in the earlier eighteenth century… represents a historically unique moment. Purity of diction requires the participation of nearly all writing genres in the forging of a standard vernacular, in other words, a linguistically homogenous bourgeois public sphere. When the successful dissemination of the standard permits production in genres which have no canonical authorization, but which are nevertheless unimpeachable vehicles of polite speech, a canonical crisis arises in the form of an anxious discrimination of ‘serious’ from ‘popular’ writing. Wordsworth can conjure an apocalyptic scenario in which the works / of Milton and Shakespeare are swallowed up in the sea of popular writing only because the distinction between serious and popular genres produces no corresponding linguistic differentiation within the reading public. The language of Radcliffe and Scott is as pure and correct as the language of the poets, but this condition does not obtain indefinitely. The division of literary production into ‘literature’ and the genres which are by definition subliterary or nonliterary does eventually produce a corresponding linguistic distinction when genres are distributed by the curricula of the educational system in order to separate them out according to the levels of the system. Already in the nineteenth century certain ‘popular’ works are relegated to the lower levels of the system, other ‘serious’ works to the higher, and this sorting out across the vertical structure of the educational system, initially very modest, is gradually more marked over the succeeding century and a half. As the school becomes the exclusive agent for the dissemination of High Canonical works, replacing the quasi-educational institutions, the coffeehouses, literary clubs, and salons of eighteenth-century literacy—the realm of the bourgeois public sphere—the prestige of literary works as cultural capital is assessed according to the limit of their dissemination, their relative exclusivity. When a finite set of genres becomes the supergenre of ‘literature,’ all canonical works can be regarded as exemplifying a language essentially different from the language spoken by ‘real men,’ namely, ‘literary language.’ But from the vantage of the longue dureé, ‘literary language’ is nothing other than the successor to poetic diction, the reduction of all literature to a written language which produces a difference in speech, a social distinction, among those who have access to this second language through the schools. The theory of ‘literary language’ is indeed our poetics, even when that language appears in prose, as the ‘literariness’ of literary prose. The fact that it is still possible to speak of the intrinsic difference between literary language and ordinary language is a measure of how successfully the conservators of literature have erased its origins even in the act of writing its history.” (Guillory 132-133)


“”because of their dependence on the sort of techniques of organizing and composing landscape that I have been discussing, the cultivated classes in England felt much more at ease, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in landscape which had been enclosed" (32). And: "The effect, far from suggesting any sense of locality, instead serves to show that one locality . . . can be treated in much the same way as another, in that it can be persuaded to illustrate the same rhetorical commonplaces. " I propose that the effect of generality in locodescriptive poetry is precisely the reinhabiting of the emptied "common" by the rhetorical commonplace.” (363)

”Roy Porter, English Society in the Eighteenth Century (Harmondsworth: Pen- guin Books, 1982), 65, cites a typical statement of Defoe's: "Men are every day starting up from obscurity to wealth." The question of social mobility is no longer a simple one, if it ever was, and I must therefore add the following qualifications. Historians are now inclined to emphasize a disparity between the perception of up- ward mobility and the actual rate at which this mobility occurred. Doubtless if one confines the definition of mobility to actual examples of the bourgeoisie passing into the ranks of the nobility, the numbers of those passing, as Lawrence Stone has demonstrated in The Open Elite? England 1540-1880 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), are relatively small. Stone biases his study by constricting his definition of the ruling elite to the landed country "squirearchy," and he is thus able to conclude that the "perennial openness of England's landed elite to penetration by members of newly enriched bourgeoisie is clearly no more than a hoary myth." Now this statistical revisionism is based upon what can only be an arbitrary judgment about precisely what minimum number of aristocratized bourgeois would qualify the elite as "open." Setting aside the question of whether this use of statistics is not intended to confound the very possibility of a class analysis, one may at least argue that the perception of upward mobility, which was ubiquitous and even hysterical in the eighteenth century, is a real event with real historical consequences. For a somewhat different analysis than Stone's, see Peter Laslett's The World We Have / Lost (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1965). The perception of upward mo- bility is related to the demonstrable imitation of aristocratic manners by the profes- sional middle classes and the haute bourgeoisie. The concept of upward mobility therefore cannot be confined to the actual expansion of the landed elite: its site is rather the cultural homogenization of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, which Auerbach describes in the literary/linguistic sphere. Here the evidence Stone him- self collects suggests the cardinal importance of education in this process of homog- enization (27,408), particularly the significance of the professional middle classes, the "middling sort," who were more easily capable of acquiring the knowledge and manners of the aristocracy than of acquiring vast landed capital. It is this version of social mobility which is crucial to the present argument.” (363-364)

“Herbert McLachlan, English Education Under the Test Acts (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1931),216. In a recent study, The Pristine Culture of Capitalism: A Historical Essay on Old Regimes and Modern States (London: Verso, 1991), p. 82, Ellen Meiksins Wood remarks how narrow this linguistic prac- tice could be: "Britain is certainly not alone among European nations to identify social classes by means of differential sound patterns in their habits of speech. But it is perhaps distinctive in the extent to which sound patterns, the conventions of pro- nunciation, predominate over other linguistic criteria of social difference.”” (365)

“The significance of middle-class women in this movement has been recently stressed by Nancy Armstrong, "Literature as Women's History," Genre 19 (Winter 1986),367: "Today few of us realize that many features of our standard humanities curriculum came from a curriculum designed specifically for educating polite young women who were not of the ruling class, or that the teaching of native British literature developed as a means of socializing children, the poor, and foreigners be- fore we became a masculine profession." Barbauld was uniquely privileged in he / educational opportunities (she even persuaded her father, Dr. Aiken, to teach her Latin and Greek), although she was not an advocate of schools for women. She seems to have promoted instead the more unofficial instruments of literary culture as a means of disseminating knowledge to women.” (365-366)

“For a brief account of Old Corruption, see Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer, The Great Arch: English State Formation as Cultural Revolution (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987). We might contextualize Gray's ignoble/noble strife here by point- ing also to the libelles of the French underground press, which actively dele- gitimized the French nobility in the decades before the revolution. Robert Darnton writes in The Literary Underground ofthe Old Regime (Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1982),29: "The grand monde was the real target of the libelles. They slandered the court, the church, the aristocracy, the academies, the salons, every- thing elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself, with a scurrility that is difficult to imagine today, although it has a long career in underground litera- ture." Similarly, the ethico-satiric productions of English High Culture sublimate Grub Street productions by the same techniques of "normalization" to which Gray's classical sources are subjected. Darnton's study is quite pertinent to the general argument of this essay, though it would lead us to an account of how differently the nationalizing of French literature proceeds. Darnton notes in passing that the Academie Franc;aise restricted literary immortality to "forty privileged individuals" (21). For a recent consideration of "Grub Street," as this notion is mystified by the distinction between High and Low Culture, see Kathy Macdermott, "Literature and the Grub Street Myth," in Popular Fictions: Essays in Literature and His- tory, ed. Peter Humm et al. (London: Methuen, 1986), 16-28.” (366)

"John Aiken, "Essay on Ballads and Pastoral Songs" (1793), quoted in A Book of English Verse, ed. John Barrell and John Bull (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975),435. One might remark here on a certain tension between the nationalist agenda carried by the forging of a vernacular standard and the invention of "traditions, " the latter manifested by the movement to collect specimens of the earliest English poetry (Percy's Reliques, for example). This tension might be described as the difference between the cultural value of the bourgeois sociolect and the ideo- logical value of "authentic" English dialect; perhaps the hypothetical grounding of the bourgeois sociolect in peasant speech was one way of resolving this tension.” (368)

“Since the High Culture canon is for us a given of higher education, its relation to "juvenile" literature-which no less than "great" works has a history of canon formation in the schools-has been unfortunately obscured. I would like to open up the question of this other canon, if it cannot be thoroughly explored here, by invoking some of the names in its pantheon (randomly selected): O. Henry, Ambrose Bierce, Washington Irving, Richard Connell (author of "The Most Dan- gerous Game"), Edgar Allan Poe, James Thurber, Robert Louis Stevenson, John Masefield, Carl Sandburg, Edwin Arlington Robinson, A. E. Housman, Amy Lowell, Robert Frost. The fact that some of these names appear in the High Culture canon is an interesting, not an invalidating, complication of the present thesis. Gray's "Elegy" is itself an example of this dual citizenship, since it has so frequently been taught at the primary and secondary levels.” (368)</Text>

            <Text>Plan of Study
A recent article by Kathleen Bode calling for a “data-rich literary history” exemplifies a current shift in digital humanities research. Bode critiques pioneers of distant reading and literary macroanalysis Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they use as proof of their arguments. As an alternative, Bode calls for an integration of computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799, to redefine our understanding of the definitive works of this decade.
Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 titles published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. The 1790s saw the emergence of popular novels, Romantic poetry, and radical political philosophy. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole, and a selective literary canon began to take form.
My dissertation consists of two major experiments. The first experiment centres on the books and booklets (which I collectively term “titles”) printed during this decade, to identify which titles are most popular by mutiple metrics, and to challenge past oversimplifications of popularity. I write my own small computer programs to combine the 1790s holdings of twenty databases. Because these programs do not need to be fully developed into software for general use, I can write them quickly and independently. I will compare which titles appear in which archives, identify reprints, and use topic modelling to categorize their general contents. This work will allow me to identify material (such as sermons) that has been systematically excluded from specialized digital archives, revealing how these archives re-inscribe a literary canon. This phase of the project has completed data collection and begun experimentation; analysis will be complete by March 2019.
The OGS would therefore primarily fund the second experiment, which will occupy the fifth year of my five-year PhD program. This experiment turns from texts to their makers, undertaking a comprehensive mapping focused on persons, rather than titles. In addition to distinguishing between ‘high’ and ‘low’ literary content, the 1790s saw a distinction between ‘mainstream’ and ‘marginal’ (usually politically radical) writers and publishers. However, the nature of the radicals’ marginalization is in question. Building off of existing resources like the British Book Trade Index database and Linked Open Data frameworks, I will create a network graph of all authors, publishers, and printers operating in England 1789 to 1799. The primary technical challenge to this project, as in the first project, will be rendering existing data interoperable; I will again write small programs to adapt and manipulate this data until it is possible to visualize the social network underlying a decade of print production. I will then examine this social network to see if it does, indeed, display a distinct ‘mainstream’. The graph may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, I will analyse the shape the network ultimately displays, to either reaffirm or redefine our understanding of eighteenth century radical print culture.
The project as a whole builds off of scholarship in both the digital humanities and bibliography, providing missing links between disparate fragments of information. By correlating this information, I can revise our understanding of the most popular works during a volatile decade of literary history, and establish a methodology for future computational work.

            <Text>Searching the ESTC for records which both have “Toronto” in the library name and “Charlotte Turner” in the author name turns up two records: volume one of Rural Walks (1795) and Minor Morals (1798), both held at the Toronto public library. The Toronto Public Library catalogue has two distinct author identities for “Smith, Charlotte Turner, 1749-1806, author.” and for “Smith, Charlotte, 1749-1806,” and the special collections holdings only appear under the latter name (making them initially difficult to find). Under the “Smith, Charlotte” name, however, six titles printed during Smith’s appear: the two listed in ESTC, plus a complete two-volume copy of Rural Walks (1795), the first and second editions of Rambles Farther (1796 and 1800), and Conversations Introducing Poetry (1804). Of these, Rural Walks and both editions of Rambles Farther are listed in the ESTC but without records of the Toronto copies. All six titles are part of the Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books. [This is interesting because it shows how scholarly disciplinary interpretations perpetuate themselves infrastructurally: as a Toronto-based scholar, the path is easier for me to study Smith-the-children’s-writer than other Smiths.]</Text>

            <Title>Cronin is wrong about print culture</Title>
            <Text>Despite the fact that Cronin’s chief interest is in each poet’s use of language to construct an ideal audience, print culture looms. Of Erasmus Darwin, Cronin emphasizes Darwin’s use of “[t]he most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status,” namely, “the language of science” (16), but it is the “beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden” (29) which asserts his importance. Blake’s eccentric, idiosyncratic language is mirrored in his eccentric, idiosyncratic printing practices (60). Southey and Landor’s universal, international language seeks to “escape from history” (81), which entails disavowing not only the popular prose fictions which sought to represent history but also the very circulating libraries in which they were distributed (74). In other words, Cronin, even more so than Bainbridge, seems to use ‘poetic language’ to explain phenomena which have important print culture dimensions.</Text>

“Radcliffe’s heroine in The Italian comes in for relatively little discussion. Perhaps this is because, as Kate Ellis observes, while Udolpho is Radcliffe’s most female-centered novel, The Italian is Radcliffe’s least female-centric novel insofar as its focus is on the developing consciousness of the villain rather than the heroine (TC321). It is interesting in this respect that such a novel should often be regarded as Radcliffe’s best work.” (Rogers 11)</Text>

            <Text>HathiTrust’s success in acquiring scholarly capital stands in interesting contrast with Project Gutenberg’s continued lack of cachet. Project Gutenberg is used in research with similar frequency to Google Books’ n-gram tool, but scholars often mention Project Gutenberg with a note of apology for not having found a better source. Its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its actual use and utility, likely, I argue, because its organizing principles are the ‘unserious’ ones of popularity and pleasure. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. This criteria might not render Project Gutenberg more useful for scholarly work but, it nonetheless narrows its selection substantially. Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but an order of magnitude fewer than its more voracious potential competitors. In taking Project Gutenberg seriously as a collection of texts, I seek to explore the extent to which its reputation as “unreliable” may or may not be deserved.</Text>

This chapter use a stylometric approach to computationally identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora.

            <Text>“THE POPULARITY OF ENGLISH RENAISSANCE PRINTED PLAYS declined dramatically in 1997. For most of the twentieth century, scholars had asserted that plays were a successful portion of the book trade, yielding a predictable profit for publishers.” (1)
“Since 1997, however, Shakespeareans have tended to argue a position just the opposite of this received wisdom. Printed plays, it is now maintained, were “risky business ventures” in which publishers, who “in most cases had little or nothing to gain from playbooks,” were “understandably reluctant” to invest.” (1)

“This shift in scholarly thinking can be dated to Peter W. M. Blayney’s landmark article,“The Publication of Playbooks,” cited by all of the authors quoted above” (2)

“He argues instead that new plays“never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books,” comprising between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent of the entries in the ShortTitle Catalogue from 1583 to 1642.” (3)
“From 1583 to 1602, “only” 48 percent of first editions were reprinted within twenty-five years; from 1603 to 1622, the figure is just over 50 percent; from 1623 to 1642, less than 29 percent.17 “Fewer than 21 percent of the plays published in the sixty years under discussion reached a second edition inside nine years”; this / means, he argues, that “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years.” (3-4)

“Whereas much early-twentieth-century bibliographic scholarship was impressionistic and based on a priori assumptions about the popularity of printed drama, Blayney provides a detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays as evidence against the “myth” of the popularity of playbooks. But, like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books.” (4)

“popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (4)

“Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends. While the myth of piracy is false, the “myth” of playbook popularity happens to be true.” (4)
“Blayney judges best-sellers by total number of editions within twenty-five years of first publication” (4)
“as we will argue, the ShortTitle Catalogue (STC) in its entirety is far too broad to serve this function” (4)

“The criterion that brings us closest to consumer demand is the rate of reprinting of playbooks, since a publisher’s decision to reprint can usually be assumed to indicate both that the previous edition had sold out (or was about to sell out) and that the publisher anticipated continued demand for the book.” (5)
“Admittedly, reprint rates tell us neither the number of individual copies bought and sold nor the total capital invested in or profits earned from the sale of plays” (5)
“We can, though, estimate profitability, as we do later in the essay, by using sheet lengths as a gauge for comparing the likely profits of a typical playbook with those of other kinds of books. Used in conjunction with profitability estimates, market share, and total editions, reprint rates can provide our best indication of the kind of popularity in which most of us are interested—the popularity of books with customers.” (6)

“Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest. They turned a profit more reliably than most other types of books, and this profit would not have been paltry” (6)

“Figures 1 and 2 show that the trends in the publication of printed professional plays divide that market into six distinct periods:” (7)
1576–1597: an initial period of low production (48 first editions, 11 second-plus editions) 
1598–1613: a boom followed by sustained high production (129 first editions, 79 second-plus editions) 
1614–1628: a gradual contraction, with production levels generally still above those of 1576–1597 (31 first editions, 65 second-plus editions) 
1629–1640: a second boom (122 first editions, 84 second-plus editions) 1641–1649: a sharp contraction, with only one play published from 1643 to 1645 
(17 first editions, 10 second-plus editions) 1650–1660: an expansion to levels slightly above those of 1614–1628 (58 first editions, 27 second-plus editions) 
“as figure 1 indicates, this first extended boom was initially driven by a rapid increase in second editions, not new plays” (10)
“Further, more and more stationers started entering the market for printed professional drama. From 1600 to 1602, 71 percent of first editions were produced by stationers who had never previously published a single play. Before then, play publication had been concentrated among relatively few stationers, with stationers new to professional drama bringing out only 20 percent of the first editions printed from 1595 to 1597, and only 36 percent of those printed from 1598 to 1599. The boom thus resulted in a widening, not merely a deepening, of stationer interest in playbooks.” (10)

“The ensuing period of market contraction for printed plays underscores the relative independence of print from the stage.” (11)
“this steep decline is accounted for almost entirely by a plunge in first editions from 8.1 to 2.1 per year. Indeed, according to the extant archive, from 1626 to 1628 not a single new professional play reached print, the first time such a suspension of play publication had occurred since 1588. The publication of second-plus editions, by contrast, hardly changed at all, decreasing only slightly from 4.9 to 4.3 editions per year.” (12)
“Some combination of changes in both supply and demand probably underlies the contraction, but what both hypotheses reveal is the centrality of reprints to the market for printed drama.” (12)

“When we include second-plus editions, Shakespeare’s plays occupy an even larger share of the overall market (twenty-three of eighty playbooks, or 29 percent). Shakespeare’s closest competitors during this seven-year period lag far behind: Robert Greene (nine playbooks) and Christopher Marlowe (five playbooks). We should point out, however, that Shakespeare was named on only nine of these title pages, which is hardly surprising given that authors in general appeared on only 36 percent of all play title pages during this period.” (11)

“second-plus editions were an extremely safe investment, for they almost always sold well enough to be printed in yet another edition; from 1576 to 1625, a whopping 72 percent of second-plus editions were reprinted within twenty years” (12)
“Reprints, which were surely less dependent on theatrical popularity than first editions, formed the backbone of the trade in printed plays.” (13)

“However much the Jonson and Shakespeare folios may have elevated the cultural value of drama, they seem to have had little or no effect on its economic value. Instead, what created that economic value and finally established the market for printed drama was not these imposing folios but rather the more humble quarto reprints from the end of the 1590s.” (13)

“Once the market for printed professional plays had been created, just how significant was it? Blayney estimates that new plays accounted for 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent of all entries in the STC from 1583 to 1642.35 We would argue that these figures do not properly reflect the significance of playbooks in the book trade.” (13)
“by setting the number of plays against the total number of entries in the STC, Blayney’s figures compare apples and oranges. Although the STC presents the best picture we have of the mass of printed material circulating in early modern England, a fair number of entries, as Blayney himself notes, do not represent separate editions at all but are instead merely variant issues or states of a single edition.” (13)
“Blayney deals with playtexts, not playbooks, and so includes twenty-nine plays published only in collection and not as separate books.” (13)

“While all playbooks were “speculative,” meaning that publishers decided to invest in them based on their assessment of potential consumer demand, not all books carried this element of risk. When stationers produced state proclamations, visitation articles, or university act verses and theses—to take just a few frequent examples—they were not making decisions about the commercial viability of these items; rather, they were paid in advance and printed them on command.” (14)
“this question of speculation is crucial if we want to use market share to assess popularity” (14)
“we produced a sample of the STC from 1590 to 1640 by selecting six discrete years (1590, 1600, 1610, 1620, 1630, 1635) and examining every entry listed for those years, excluding variant issues and non-speculative books of the kinds discussed above” (14)
“79 percent are for speculative publications” (14)

“As the lower line on figure 3 shows, printed plays constituted a much larger market share than previously thought; indeed, in periods of expansion, that share was three times larger than Blayney’s figures show.” (14)
“in their peak years, professional plays made up 6.2 percent of the overall speculative market, or one in every sixteen speculative editions. While certainly not the dominant segment, playbooks were hardly marginal” (16)
“Figure 3 also confirms that changes in the market for plays were not simply responses to changes in the book trade as a whole; rather, the expansions and contractions in the total number of printed plays were also expansions and contractions in their market share” (16)

“these figures do not tell us the proportion of individual copies of printed plays among copies of all books, since we lack evidence for the press runs of most editions. Nor do they tell us the total capital invested in and revenue generated by playbooks compared to other classes of books.” (16)
“Without this evidence, we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books in early modern England, if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists or a publishing firm’s “bottom line.”” (16)

“It is nonetheless obvious that, in terms both of total copies sold and of total investment and profits, the dominant force in the early modern speculative book trade was a select group of titles protected by royal patents or by the English Stock monopoly. These include almanacs, Bibles, catechisms, and school books.” (16)
“While patented and monopolistic books comprise only about 11 percent of the total entries in our STC sample, that figure understates their importance, for not only were these books produced in greater press runs, but some, such as almanacs and primers, have higher loss rates as well.” (17)
“patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (17)
“Isolating the market for non-monopolistic books thus tells us more about stationers’ evaluations of uncertain demand than does an analysis that lumps together risky non-monopolistic books with constantly reprinted monopolistic titles.” (17)

“If we want to understand not which books were the most important financially to the book trade as a whole but rather how attractive playbooks were as investments, then we need to determine how often stationers chose to publish plays rather than other kinds of books available to them.” (17)

“Whether these figures seem high or low is to some degree a subjective measure. Both the “maximal” and the “minimal” market shares presented in figure 3 certainly suggest that playbooks were much more prevalent than recent scholarship has supposed, but whether they demonstrate the popularity of playbooks is a determination that can be made only after further studies produce the corresponding figures for other classes of books (poetry, travel, or medicine, for instance).” (18)
“we will compare playbooks to printed sermons, but without more such analyses, it is not possible to establish clearly the relative popularity of playbooks in terms of market share. What is certain, however, is that printed plays sold very well indeed compared to other kinds of books” (18)

“The problem, then, is not with these figures per se but with the fact that, because popularity is a relative concept, one cannot determine whether Blayney’s data indicate the relative unpopularity of playbooks (as he claims) or the relative popularity of playbooks, unless one knows how they compare to the reprint rates of other books.” (18)
“they were reprinted at more than twice the rate of speculative books in general (39.9 percent versus 18.1 percent)” (18)
“And these reprints were themselves extremely popular, with almost three-quarters of all second-plus editions reaching a further edition.” (20)
“Playbooks compare very well not only to a representative sample of all speculative books but also to the entire extant archive of one class of books, sermons in English, often considered one of the more successful segments of the early modern book trade” (21)

“judging by market share, sermons do indeed appear to have been more popular than playbooks” (21)
“During the period of their highest production (1606–1640), printed sermons averaged just over forty-two editions per year, comprising 9.8 percent of the speculative market (or 11.4 percent of the non-monopolistic speculative market), more than twice the market share of professional plays during their two highest periods.” (21)
“But if we assess sermons by reprint rates, their relative popularity begins to dim: 19.3 percent of sermons first printed from 1576 to 1625 were reprinted inside twenty years, almost exactly the rate for speculative books in general. Even during the period of their peak reprint rates—29.9 percent from 1591 to 1606—sermons were reprinted much less frequently than were professional plays.” (21)
“Figure 5 shows the percentage of all professional plays and sermons first printed from 1576 to 1625 that reached two editions, three editions, and so on through ten or more editions by 1660. At each level, playbooks outperform sermons” (22)
“In fact, playbooks were more likely to reach a third edition by 1660 (26.1 percent) than the average English sermon was to reach a second (20 percent).” (22)
“Therefore, unless the combined press runs of a play’s first two editions were regularly smaller than the press run of the first edition of a sermon (and this seems highly improbable), then the typical playbook must have sold more total individual copies than the typical sermon.” (22)

“Playbooks outperformed sermons partly because plays were, in one important sense, less ephemeral than sermons. If a sermon was not reprinted within five years of its initial publication, it was highly unlikely ever to be reprinted.” (22)
“playbooks were just as likely to be first reprinted after five years as within five years” (22)
“Plays not only repaid their publishers’ investments more quickly than other books, but they also remained profitable far longer.” (24)

“The reprint success of playbooks, however, may give rise to the question of why more weren’t published if they were such a good investment for stationers.” (24)
“an average of just under six per year—has nevertheless seemed quite a low number to most recent scholars” (24)

[Is it because they are too short to be able to turn enough profit to be worthwhile? no]
“The median (rather than the average) length of these 987 titles was only ten-and-ahalf sheets” (25)
“Because playbooks were fairly typical in length—and therefore in price and potential profits—and, at the same time, were far more likely to sell out than other books, many publishers must have found them attractive investments. In contrast to the low-cost, low-profit, higher-risk publications that recent scholarship has taken them to be, playbooks were in fact middling-cost, middling-profit, lower-risk publications—an appealing profile for speculators.” (25)

"Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate. Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more "popular”? After all, both sermons and playbooks seem to have been relatively popular compared to other kinds of books, but according to different criteria. For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different _structures of popularity_” (Farmer and Lesser, “Revisited”, 25-6)

“If the seeming paucity of playbooks cannot be attributed to low demand— either from consumers (judging by reprint rates) or from stationers (judging by their profit profile)—then perhaps we should investigate supply.” (25)
“early modern playing companies made their decisions based on their own economic interests, not on the interests of stationers” (26)
“Perhaps stationers would have published more plays had they been as plentiful as other texts.” (26)

“Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (26)
“Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”?” (27)
“For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (27)

“we turn briefly to the Caroline period, when the trade in playbooks, which had long functioned according to one structure of popularity, now fissured into two” (27)
“We are thus left with a seeming contradiction: if judged by reprint rates, plays seem to have become less popular in the Caroline period, yet according to two other indices of popularity—editions per year and market share—plays were at least as popular as ever.” (27)
“Reprint rates seem to have been depressed because of an unprecedented division between the structures of popularity for first and second-plus editions.” (27)
“in the Caroline period new plays were almost never reprinted, while second-plus editions continued to be reprinted at roughly the same rate” (28)
“The market for first editions was dominated by one group of publishers, and that for second-plus editions by a different group of publishers, with very little overlap” (28)
“The market for first editions seems to have been driven by customers’ desire for novelty, for the newest playbook in the stationer’s shop from the latest play performed in the theater” (28)
“The market for second-plus editions, on the other hand, depended on customers’ attachment to particular “classics,”” (28)

Methods
“STC Sample: We cannot assume that the “speculative rate” for our six-year STC sample (79 percent) automatically matches that for the entire fifty-one-year period of 1590 through 1640, so we must therefore acknowledge the potential margin of error, which in this case is ±1.4 percent.” (30)
“We have chosen for our STC sample six years—1590, 1600, 1610, 1620, 1630, and 1635—that, due to STC cataloguing practices, contain a higher than average number of entries with inferred dates” … “For these purposes, statistical tests demonstrate that entries with inferred dates are not inconsistent with all other entries in these years.” (30)

“Reprint Parameters:” “First, Blayney uses a twenty-five-year window for reprints, while we use a more conservative twenty-year window” “Second, he designates the year of publication as Year 1, while we count it as Year 0” “he has also included several university plays that we have not” “Blayney tracks plays first printed in collections separately from the collection as a whole” (31)
“whereas we are interested in reprints of playbooks, not playtexts, and so consider F2 as a single book and a single reprint of F1”
“Applying our parameters to the periods analyzed by Blayney but extending our reprint window to twenty-five years to match his yields reprint rates of 42.7 percent (thirty-eight of eighty-nine) for 1583–1602, 43.1 percent (forty-seven of 109) for 1603–22, and 15.6 percent (twenty-one of 135) for 1623–42. Since Blayney’s figures turn out to be higher than ours, our argument about the popularity of playbooks remains unaffected.”

“Sermon Archive: Our sermon archive includes all known editions of sermons in English first printed from 1576 to 1640. We compiled this archive by searching in the STC and ESTC, and by consulting the following works”

            <Text>“This greatly expanded record of nineteenth-century Australian newspaper fiction was created as a basis for what I call data-rich literary history, and what many scholars, especially in the United States, refer to in the terminology of the field’s most prominent practitioner, Franco Moretti, as “distant reading.”4 This approach to literary history applies computational methods of analysis to large bibliographical Page 3 → and/or textual datasets—derived increasingly though not exclusively from mass-digitized collections—to explore how literary works existed, interrelated, and generated meaning in the past. By investigating the cultural and material contexts in which literature was produced, circulated, and read, data-rich literary history seeks to challenge and move beyond the literary canons that organize perceptions of past literature in the present. This, then, was my intention: to move from question, to opportunity, to answers and, in so doing, to advance a noncanonical, data-rich, and transnational history of the literary, publishing, and reading cultures of nineteenth-century Australia. But working with Trove interrupted that neat sequence. Instead of simply answering questions, that engagement produced its own, pressing questions about the nature and implications of literary history conducted with mass-digitized collections and the literary data derived from them.” (2-3)

“I came to realize that this supposedly precritical activity formed an extended historical argument in and of itself, in the context of a specific mass-digitized collection.” (3)

“And while current discussion of mass-digitization foregrounds the scale of such collections and the extensiveness of the digital access they provide, I became increasingly conscious of the gaps in Trove: and this is a mass-digitized collection that is among the largest, and most complete, in the world. When I looked to other data-rich literary history projects to see how they were meeting this challenge I found that the complex relationships between documentary record, digitization, data curation, and historical analysis were not fully articulated.” (3)

“The result of the questions and opportunities that led me to this project—and of the questions they, in turn, generated—is a book in two parts. The first explores limitations in existing approaches to data-rich literary history and offers an alternative in the form of a new scholarly object of analysis. My central contention in this first part is that, whateverPage 4 → computational methods allow us to do with ever-growing collections of literary data, the results cannot advance knowledge if the literary data analyzed do not effectively represent the historical context we seek to understand. I draw on the theoretical and practical foundations of textual scholarship to constitute what I call a scholarly edition of a literary system: that is, a model of literary works that were published, circulated, and read—and thereby accrued meaning—in a specific historical context, constructed with reference to the history of transmission by which documentary evidence of those works is constituted.” (3-4)
“The second part of A World of Fiction demonstrates how analysis of a scholarly edition of a literary system can revolutionize knowledge of literary history as well as the frameworks and concepts through which we perceive past literature in the present. While the “transnational turn” in Australian literary studies has represented nineteenth-century Australian readers as oriented almost entirely toward British fiction, I offer a more complex picture: one where this orientation exists, but where colonial authors, publishers, and readers also forged a distinctive Australian literary culture. In the process, I describe an entirely new organization for and structures within literary culture in the colonies and demonstrate the capacity of data-rich literary history to advance understanding of major concepts and phenomena in the broader discipline, ranging from literary anonymity and pseudonymity to reception, fiction reprinting and syndication, and the nature of literary traditions.” (4)

“For this book I did not simply theorize a scholarly edition; I built one. Its curated dataset is a subset of the 16,500 titles I discovered in the nineteenth-century Australian newspapers digitized by Trove.”(7)

“ I chose to focus on nineteenth-century extended fiction—to subject those titles to extensive historical and bibliographical research and representation—becausePage 8 → those works constitute a literary system in the form of production and reception they imply. While stories completed in a single newspaper issue suggest incidental publishing and reading—with such content often selected simply to fill column inches and likely read in a casual manner—extended fiction required deliberate sourcing and publishing by editors and implies more intensive or committed engagement from readers.”(7-8)

“As well as a basis for the arguments presented in A World of Fiction, this scholarly edition of a literary system is, fundamentally, for others to use. It makes the outcomes of a rigorous engagement with a mass-digitized collection available for the benefit of all literary historians, whether they are computationally inclined or not. Accordingly, while the argument it embodies about the existence of, and the interrelationships between, literary works in the past is an outcome of analysis, it is also a basis for future exploration. As I elaborate with examples in the conclusion, like a scholarly edition of a literary work, a scholarly edition of a literary system is designed to enable and advance—rather than to decide or conclude—investigation.” (8) &lt;— connection to Open Access research: the datasets are themselves published in multiple accessible, transformable forms

“In using this scholarly edition to investigate extended fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers, each of the three chapters in the book’s second part adapts and applies a core digital humanities method: bibliometrics in chapter 4, network analysis in chapter 5, and topic modeling in chapter 6. Each chapter begins with a critical analysisPage 9 → of the respective method: although it is a premise of the book that data-rich literary history should not focus on the methods of analysis used to the detriment of the object analyzed, in a field that attempts to understand literature and culture by applying techniques devised for other purposes a critical approach to methodology is essential.” (8-9)

“In presenting the results of this analysis, these three chapters intervene in a prominent critical trajectory in literary studies, for Australia and internationally: the so-called transnational turn. As has been the case for many national literary fields, in recent decades Australian literary scholars have recognized that Australian literary history is not coterminous with the history of literature by Australians.” (9)
“In investigating the main form of local publishing and source of fiction in nineteenth-century Australia—newspapersPage 10 →—this book explores the profound importance of British fiction to literary production and reception in the colonies. But it denies that the relationship to British culture was one of subservience and imitation. To the contrary, I demonstrate at scale what emerging analyses of individual works and reading practices increasingly recognize: how literary forms and practices were translated and transformed by their colonial enactment.10 More contentiously, I emphasize the distinctiveness of literary culture in the colonies, including in the forms of writing and authorship that readers valued, in how fiction was sourced, and in the themes explored in Australian stories.” (9-10)

“A World of Fiction works across, while contributing to, two fields—digital humanities and literary history—that are in many ways closely integrated, while in others, still academic worlds apart. It may well be that scholars who primarily align themselves with digital humanities will gravitate to the discussion of digital knowledge infrastructure, digitization, data, remediation, and modeling in part 1 and to the critiques of digital methods that begin the other chapters. Alternatively, literary, book, and media historians might find more of specific interest in part Page 13 →2’s exploration of literary production and reception and of the transnational circulation of nineteenth-century fiction in periodical form.
While such variation in the interests of readers is perhaps inevitable, the two parts of this book fundamentally require and inform each other. Although it is often understood as such, literary history is not solely an analytical and critical enterprise; it has always been bound up in—enabled and produced by—the knowledge infrastructure that it creates and employs. Equally, although digital humanities is frequently presented as a methodological and infrastructural endeavor, it is just as much a historical and analytical one. The approaches and infrastructure developed and employed in that field have histories, just as the conceptual entities examined—including literary data and computational models—are critical and interpretive constructs. Confronting the challenges and possibilities that new digital technologies and resources bring to literary history and to the humanities broadly requires a mutually informative relationship of traditional and digital scholarship. Only such a relationship can enable the emergence and consolidation of the new forms of evidence, analysis, and argumentation required by the contemporary conditions of cultural research.” (12-13)</Text>

            <Text>A recent article by Bode exemplifies a current shift in approaches to digitally-enhanced literary scholarship. Bode builds a critique of “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as complete and objective, Bode argues, it is not different from New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.

I have narrowed my scope to an eleven-year “decade,” keyed to the French Revolution, to make my inquiry feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 works published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.

To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading and corpus stylistics, but I will marry these to bibliographic textual studies and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired bibliographic records for 51,965 works listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewhere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, enabling more detailed computational exploration of their subject matter. 

I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically and influentially during the 1790s, but are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon.

The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and will recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.</Text>

            <Text>Chapter five takes the complex methodologies developed in the preceding three chapters, and stress-tests them on More’s difficult publication history. The many Cheap Repository Tracts are difficult to comprehensively identify and attribute authorship to: how have digital resources dealt with these challenges? I am particularly interested in examining publication details which More might have exaggerated for promotional purposes: what grounds can be identified for her claims of exceptional circulation rates? Of particular interest is the fact that More reprinted some Cheap Repository Tracts in different formats for different price points and audiences. Can these differences be captured in the databases I examine? Examining More’s oeuvre also raises questions of literariness: if, as I expect, the Cheap Repository Tracts are excluded from more selective databases, is this appropriate? What kinds of “non-literary” writing is included in each database? This question brings my bibliographic research back home to the core questions about canon-building which drive my inquiry. To this point, I have sought ways to evaluate authors’ popularity and their importance in the print marketplace, as related metrics which underly the authors’ reputations. With More, I explore directly the use of literariness as an inherently unquantifiable metric of selection.</Text>

            <Text>IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability
Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?</Text>

            <Text>One potential chapter, for example, might examine Hannah More and William Wordsworth’s varying use of supernatural content and ballad forms as literary tools to “elevate” their readers. This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.</Text>

            <Text>“The preliminary remarks on the question of value in Chapter 1 argue that the process of canon formation cannot be reduced to acts of evaluation in the simple sense of affirming or rejecting the specific values assumed to be expressed in a literary work. Having granted the obvious fact that acts of evaluation are always presupposed by the process of canon formation as a necessary but not sufficient condition of that process, I then attempted to demonstrate in the following chapters that the institution which is the historical site of these evaluative acts--the school--subordinates specific values expressed in works to the social functions and institutional aims of the school itself. It is only when presented as canonical, as the cultural capital of the schools, that individual literary works can be made to serve the school's social function of regulating access to these forms of capital.” (269)
“this... does not mean that the selection of works is merely arbitrary." (269)
main criteria is "aesthetic" -- can even outweigh "manifestly repugnant or socially obsolete values” (270)
"as 'aesthetic’ objects, cultural works are not so much the sum of the values they express as the effective transcendence of them, the embodiment of ‘aesthetic value.’” (270)
circularity of definitions of 'aesthetic’ (272)
"the refusal of the aesthetic is an epistemic feature of current critical practice, constituting a consensus powerful enough to enlist in an alliance of 'left' critiques even the form of left critique--Marxist theory—historically sympathetic to aesthetics." (274)
“there is a discourse of aesthetics long before there is any conception of 'aesthetic value.’” (274)
“The fact that communities do function as though they could legislate values within their borders, and not in response to the perceived values of other imagined communities, is the most definitive testimony to their imagined status." (279)
"It is no accident that the problem of a specifically ‘aesthetic value' should arise most urgently in the debate on pornography, for it is just in this context that the distinction between aesthetic discourse and the discourse of value evinces the pretensions of both discourses to 'universalize’ / within the boundaries of 'local' communities a particular value." (279-80)
“the familiar dilemma of the contemporary critique of the canon, which always has before it the theoretically suspect option of devaluing canonical works on the basis of disapprobated values expressed within them." (281)
Smith's theory of aesthetic value: “The biophysiological mechanisms of survival are transposed into the social realm not as the subject's aesthetic cognition or perception (as in Kant) but as nothing other than the process of canon formation conceived as the survival of the fittest /object/. ” (293)
“'An object or artifact that performs certain desired/able functions particularly well… being perhaps not only ‘fit’ but exemplary... will have immediate survival advantage' (48). Smith is in this way able to spin out her evolutionary analogy into a full-scale theory of canon formation. Once canonized, a work tnds to remain so if 'it continues to perform /some/ desired/able functions prticularly well, even if not the same ones for which it was initially valued’ (49).” (293)
as a result, Smith argues, certain dense and complex texts are particularly fit for canonization, because they are well suited for frequent re-interpretation (293)
Guillory's frustration with evolutionary analogies p. 294 might be relevant if I do use Dawkins' meme theory
"social function inheres in the /category/ of the object--in the function of a particular genre, or of literature, or of art.” (295)
"function" is contingent on a prior act of classification (295)
Simmel: “'There are two sides of our relationships to objects, which we call subjectively our desire ad objectively their value' (75)” (298)
he's STILL just talking about all the ways he disagrees with Smith (299)
Smith and Simmel both treat use value and exchange value as the same, but "the discourse of political economy is founded in the eighteenth century on the /distinction/ between use value and exchange value" (300) because commodities aren't priced in terms of use value at all
as "a historical fact” of how this discourse developed, ”the virtual irrelevance of use value to economic discourse can simply be assumed” (301)
"Thus political economy relegates use value to a domain of subjectivity, which it cannot enter into the equation of exchange value. Conversely, the discourse of utilitarianism attempts to reduce the domain of the economic to the expression of the individual subject's needs or desires, and its individualism cannot account for the manifest independence of exchange value from determination by the individual subject." (302)
both “aesthetics and political economy /as discourses/ ... gestate in the body of what in the eighteenth century was called 'moral philosophy,' and the can be said…to have been separated at birth" (303)
"the practice of judging works of art need make no reference at all to the concept of value before the emergence of political economy… the comparison of authors or works to one another need not at that time be expressed as the comparison of their relative 'aesthetic values,' because neither the concept of the aesthetic, nor the concept of value, are as yet defined in such a way that they can be yoked together.” (303)
“The largest historical condition for the formation of a discourse of moral philosophy is the emergence in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of ‘civil society' as a distinct and relatively autonomous sector of the social order, the sector of economic competition, commerce, and production.” (304)
“The manifest dependence of the welfare of the nation upon the sectors of trade and manufacture generated a set of policy problems for which no traditional discourse provided solutions; preeminent among these was the problem of to what extent the state was needed to intervene in these sectors of trade or commerce." (304)
“Moral philosophy saw ‘civil society’ as a collection of individuals, relatively unrestrained by the state in their competition with each other, each acting in his or her immediate interest. The problem was to deduce the principle of the manifest order of society from the apparent disorder of incompatible individuals self-interests.” (305)
British “analogy between the aesthetic and the social order” -- discuss the social order as a matter of 'taste’ (305)
“On the Continent, by contrast, civil society was less well developed" (306) -- I'm just quoting this because it's a funny phrase to me
make art instead of luxuries to check the progress of vice (307)
distinction between art and commodity not perfect: novels &amp; prints manufactured in bulk, useful china &amp; furniture can have opulent designs (308)
“Moral philosophy could thus generate... a distinction between objects on the basis of whether they were directed to the end of utility…or to the end of contemplation” (308) - a new systematic distinction
“The division of labor, the employment of wage-labor, vastly increased the accumulation of commodities, but it did not necessarily increase their fineness; it rather exposed the apparent aesthetic inferiority of commodities to works of art. Hence the qualitative distinction between the work of art and the commodity could be coordinated with class distinction as the distinction between taste and the lack of it.”(313)
“In order to reestablish the proportion of production and consumption, polticial economy must invent the concept of 'use value,' on the /analogy/ of 'exchange value.’ Casting its lot with an ahtropology of needs, it has to forget the aesthetic theory which posited the surplus of beauty over use as the motor of production, as the engine of social life. The theory of taste becomes irrelevant to political economy, and the 'invisible hand' can be reconceived" (315)
“just as bourgeois political economists found it necessary to discard aesthetics, in order to make sense of the system of production and exchange, so did the bourgeoisie find it necessary to take up a 'pure' aesthetics supposedly uncontaminated by economic considerations, in order to distinguish itself /culturally/ from the class which produced what it consumed." (316)
"It is too easy to refute Hume or Kant as though their problem of /taste/ were simply identical to our problem of aesthetic /value/. By ignoring the specificity of these terms, we lose sight of the historical moment when the 'standard of taste' moved into analogical relation to the 'measure of value.' … a reversal of the charges ... Where, before the advent of Adam Smith's political economy, the harmony of the economic order could be analogized to the beauty of the work of art, subsequently it becomes possible and even necessary to reconcieve aesthetic judgment by /analogy to exchange value/.” (317)
“aesthetics immediately reasserted, against the universality of economic commensurability, a theory of the incommensurability of aesthetic and economic values, on the basis of the inutility of the aesthetic object.” (317)
“This mutual forgetting constitutes aesthetics and political economy as antithetical discourses which between them divide the world of cultural production into works of art and commodities." (317)
transition to impact on political economy when aesthetics becomes separate discourse (319)
“the largest unresolved problem in social theory, the problem of the relation between the economical and the cultural" (320) -- his big Q
"The premise of our social life is the absolute commensurability of everything. The language of judgment has been transformed into the discourse of ‘value-judgments’” --&gt; "cultural relativism's celebration of the plurality of values” (323)
“the market is the historical /condition/ and not merely the proper analogy for the extension of the value-concept to all acts of judgment." (324)
“both 'values' and the discourse of value are historically /determined/ as objective social facts." (325)
Bourdieu: “Symbolic goods are a two-faced reality, a commodity and a symbolic object: their specifically cultural value and their commercial value remain relatively independent although the economic sanction may come to reinforce their cultural consecration." (Guillory 325)
“exchange in the market really does function as an epitome of social relations, as everyone thought it did, but as the site of the objective disharmony of these relations, as the site of the commensuration of the incommensurable values objectified in every object. The 'logic of equivalence,' according to which every exchange is supposed to be an /equal/ exchange, denies the crucial fact revealed in the market, that social relations do not /make sense/.” (326)
“The status of canonical literary works as cultural capital was negotiated as though cultural capital were directly convertible into material capital, in which case works of high literary art ought to have been expensive, difficult of access." (329) but that didn’t happen
“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education” (329-330)
"as cultural works recede into the past, the simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (330)
Bourdieu - “while there are _two_ fields of production-- the restricted (High Art) and general (cultural commodities)-- there are _three_ principles of legitimacy specific to these fields” aka 1, ‘“art for artists” (“'art for art's sake’"); 2, art for the social elite, “‘bourgeois' taste”; 3, "the principle of legitimacy which its advocates call 'popular’,” mass consumption (330)
"For Bourdieu, aesthetic judgment comes in two forms: an elite aesthetic of the dominant classes, the ‘aesthetic disposition' proper, and a ‘popular' aesthetic of the dominated." (332)
“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
"To say that the aesthetic disposition determines the relative cultural capital granted to any particular work is to say that the act of judgment is the assignment, or even the recognition, of cultural capital. Judgment is the act by which the aesthetic disposition expresses or externalizes itself, according to criteria which are relatively internalized, that is, neither capable of being fully rationalized, nor materially caused in the manner of a biological predisposition.” (332)
“the nature of aesthetic pleasure itself is rendered entirely problematic" -- always 'deferred' or intellectual pleasure which is contrasted with distastefully immediate pleasures of mass media (333)
“at the level of the dominant aesthetic, the 'pleasure' in aesthetic pleasure is ideally reduced to a zero-degree, to the experience of ‘distaste,' while at the level of the popular aesthetic, the pleasure produced by cultural products fails to be aesthetic at all. At neither level is 'aesthetic pleasure' actually experienced by anyone." (333)
“What appears in the place of aesthetic pleasure in the dominant classes is the pleasure of _distinction_, pleasure in the possession of cultural capital." (333)
form vs content -- “a reductio at adsurdum of aesthetic topoi — in the case of the dominant classes, the evacuation of content; in the case of the dominated, the rejection of form" (334)
“As Michael Denning has recently reminded us, there are innumerable examples in working-class cultural forms of formal experiment and variation; it is precisely the experience of formal innovation which engages interest and admiration in these consumers, even though such manifestly aesthetic experience... may fail to be recognized as aesthetic.” (336)
“the largest effect of the discourse of canonicity: the illusion that aesthetic experience is really restricted to the experience of High Cultural works." (336)
“Bourdieu is certainly right that it is impossible to experience any cultural product apart from its status as cultural capital (high or low); and even more, that it is impossible to experience cultural capital as disarticulated from the system of class formation or commodity production. There is no realm of pure aesthetic experience, or object which elicits nothing but that experience. But I shall nonetheless argue that the specificity or aesthetic experience is not contingent upon its ‘purity.' ... It may well be impossible for example, to experience 'just sex,’ exclusive of the social meanings of sexual acts. But it would be incorrect on that account to deny the specificity of the sexual. If the revelation of the impurity of the aesthetic tempts one to deny its reality, that logical misstep is the consequence of the historical determinations which have produced aesthetic discourse as a discourse of purity.” (336)
"The recognition of cultural capital, otherwise known as aesthetic judgment, must deny, as a condition of its exercise, the ubiquity of aesthetic experience, the fact that such experience utterly pervades the field of cultural production." (336)
“Bourdieu's sociology radically historicizes the ‘aesthetic disposition' by insisting upon its determination within a class-structured society" (337)
thought experiment: "If the status of cultural products as cultural capital is in certain historical circumstances overdetermined by limited access to certain works, or by limited access to the means of consumption, then one might hypothesize that a total democratization of access to cultural products would disarticulate the formation of cultural capital from the class structure and from the markets. In that event, what would constitute cultural capital?” (337)
Marx's answer: “‘In a communist society there are no painters but at most people who engage / in painting among other activities.’” (337-338)
“The idea of production for the producers (which by definition entails /consumption/ by the producers) projects onto a utopian screen the disarticulation of cultural capital from the system of class formation, and thus from ‘distinction' based on inequality of access to cultural goods. Bourdieu calls this condition 'total autonomy from the laws of the market.' Such a condition does not, however, prophesy the disappearance of cultural capital. The universalization of restricted production would rather transform cultural capital into pure 'symbolic distinction.’” (339)
“Even were such an educational system no longer to regulate access to cultural capital in the grotesquely unequal way it presently does, cultural producers would still compete to have their products read, studied, looked at, heard, lived in, sung, worn, and would still accumulate cultural capital in the form of 'prestige’ or fame. But social distinctions reinstated on such an aesthetic basis would have to be expressed in social relations as distinctions in ‘lifestyle,' in other words a vast enlargement of the field of aesthetic judgment." (339)
“What we call canon formation would then become a much larger part of social life, because not restricted to the institutions of the materially advantaged.” (339)
Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)


Footnotes

“8Eagleton's views of the work of art in this context are fairly represented by his chapter on "Marxism and Aesthetic Value," in Criticism and Ideology (London: Verso, 1976). Lentricchia has recently repudiated those literary materialists who "speak as if the real enemy were the aesthetic" in an inteview with Imre Salusinszky, Criticism in Society (New York: Methuen, 1987),200. More recently Perry Ander- son has observed in his English Questions (London: Verso, 1992): "For aesthetic value is not to be dispatched so easily-the wish to finish with it recalling Dob- rolyubov, or Bazarov, more than Marx or Morris. Railing at canons is not the same as replacing them, which they have resisted. Evacuation of the terrain of literary / evaluation in the traditional sense necessarily leaves its conventional practitioners in place" (243).” (378-379)
“9Tony Bennett, "Really Useless 'Knowledge': A Political Critique of Aesthetics," in Thesis Eleven 12 (1985),33.” (379)
“16This point, one would hope, clarifies a confusion that derives from the appar- ent discrepancy between Smith's willingness to speak on the one hand of some works as "information-rich," and 0 0 that basis more likely to become canonical in the first place (51), and on the other hand to insist that any evaluative distinction between, for example, "Shakespeare's poetry" and "doggerel" is simply contingent in the sense that one may "prefer" doggerel in those contexts where it is the func- tion of doggerel that one is interested in. True enough! But does it matter that these latter functions are never going to be those in which the canonical status of the work is at issue? It is simply not likely that Shakespeare's poetry and some example of doggerel verse are ever going to be seriously compared in the first place. The in- teresting question is why we might think that we need to give some account of why it is Shakespeare's poetry and not some example of doggerel verse which comes to be canonical. In the actual circumstances of commensuration, doggerel verse will be compared to other doggerel verse, or Shakespeare's work to other work in simi- lar genres.” (379)
“0ne might return in this context to Herrnstein Smith's polemic against Bataille and Baudrillard for their supposed denial of the principle of economic utility. A response to that polemic would obviously point out that both Bataille and Bau- drillard are concerned with the historical conditions of capitalist social relations, specifically with the universalization of exchange. Whether or not their accounts of these relations reproduce a mythologizing narrative of a "fall" into economism (Smith makes this charge, and it is true enough in a narrow sense), that narrative still retains greater analytical accuracy than an analysis based on the simple opposi- tion between utilitarianism and anti-utilitarianism. These terms are entirely inade- quate in any case to grasp the real historical differences between so-called primitive and modern economies. On the former, see for example, Marshall Sahlins, Stone Age Economics (New York: Aldine, 1972): "Intergroup exchange does not simply answer to the 'moral purpose' of making friends. But whatever the intent and how- ever utilitarian, it will not do to make enemies. Every transaction, as we already know, is necessarily a social strategy. . . . As it happens, the safe and sane proce- dure is not just measure-for-measure, a reciprocity precisely balanced. The most tactful strategy is economic good measure, a generous return relative to what has been received, of which there can be no complaints. One remarks in these inter- group encounters a tendency to overreciprocate. . . . " (303). The practice of equal exchange produces a very different social world than the practice of overreciproca- tion, whether or not one chooses to idealize the latter. Whatever deficiencies char- acterize the theories of Bataille and Baudrillard (and let us grant deficiencies), surely the interest of their work does not lie in whether they have adopted a position which is, in Smith's terms, the correct philosophical position. Bataille and Baudrillard are less interested in the philosophical issue which exercises Smith than they are in pro- ducing a critique of the culture of capitalism. For the same reason I would suggest that there is somewhat less in common between Smith's work and Pierre Bourdieu's than may at first appear. It would be a serious misrepresentation of Bourdieu's ar- gument to claim that he is a "relativist," since he is never averse to representing objective social relations. The method of his "reflexive sociology" is to "objectify more completely one's objective and subjective relation to the object" (The Logic of Practice, 1). But this formulation already takes us into quite a different universe of discourse than the "objective/subjective" opposition Bourdieu calls "ruinous" and which seems to dominate thinking about the social in American discourse. For Bourdieu's critique of utilitarianism, see his In Other Words: Essays Towards a Re- flexive Sociology, trans. Matthew Adamson (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990), p. 108.” (381)
“37See Roy Porter, English Society in the Eighteenth Century (New York: Penguin Books, 1982): "De Saussure, for example, was amazed that artisans-even, he claimed, shoe-blacks-lounged about browsing the papers in London coffee houses. Pastor Moritz found his London landlady read Milton and other classics of English literature: 'The English national authors are in all hands, and read by all people, of which the innumerable editions they have gone through are a sufficient proof'" (239).” (382)

            <Text>1986
“The Cheap Repository has usually been discussed within the context of the turbulent politics of the 1790s and the resulting fears, on the part of the gentry and the aristocracy, of popular violence. Historians, from More's first biographer Henry Thompson to E. P. Thompson, have pointed to the publication of Painite pamphlets and the rioting of the 1790s as the catalyst of More's moralizing literature. J. L. and Barbara Hammond further identified More's writings as the ideological justification for the economic exploitation and formal political exclusion of the poor. Although some historians of the evangelical movement, Ford K. Brown in particular, have recognized that the tracts tried to reform the morals of the poor quite as much as their politics these writers have also stressed the loyalist content of the tracts, emphasizing their attempt to give religious sanction to the existing social order.” (Pederson 85)</Text>

            <Text>John Guillory contends that the “canon debate” taking place during his moment of writing in 1993 “signifies nothing less than a crisis in the form of cultural capital we call ‘literature’” \cite{Guillory:1993ve p.viii}; as both he and I argue, the roots of this crisis lie two hundred years earlier, in the eighteenth century formation of a vernacular (rather than classical) literary canon, and in the 1790s “first crisis” (\cite{Guillory:1993ve p.xi} of that canon. Guillory turns particularly to Wordsworth and Coleridge, and the strategies by which they confer a high status on their own work by undermining the cultural capital of other forms.


Guillory further argues that, although unequal access to “the means of literary production” (CITE) is intimately tied to class, the important barriers are not always purely financial. Rather, “the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered … a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself” (329). That is to say, because serious works “assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education" (330), those works [can maintain class hierarchies/barriers through OTHER MEANS.]</Text>

            <Text>THE LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF THE ESTC STEPHEN KARIAN 
The English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC) has been described as “one of the greatest scholarly ventures ever conducted” and “the largest humanistic research project of the twentieth century.” Even one of the most trenchant critics of the ESTC’s recent developments is confident that “biblio- graphical and library historians will . . . judge [the ESTC] as one of the heroic scholarly enterprises of the twentieth century.”2 For once, such superlatives are well deserved. As a union catalogue of nearly all printed matter before 1801 published in the British Isles and colonies or written in the English language, the ESTC has transformed eighteenth-century scholarship. It has enabled scholars of this period to imagine and pursue research questions that would otherwise have been extremely difficult if not impossible to answer. For many research projects concerning the English-speaking world before 1801, the ESTC is one of the best resources to identify relevant printed materials, determine their publishing histories, and find out where they can be examined.  (283)
Those responsible for laying the foundations of the ESTC in the 1970s exhibited considerable foresight in their decision not to compile a printed catalogue along the lines of the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640 or Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700. Instead, they chose to exploit the resources of computing power, which meant that ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work. The ESTC was also a remarkable collaborative effort that spanned the Atlantic and encompassed scholars as well as librarians. Visionary thinking was essential to the ESTC’s emergence, and I believe a similar kind of visionary thinking is needed now, especially in anticipation of the needs and goals of twenty-first-century scholarship. (283)

ECCO uses ESTC data for bibliographical information, though many users of ECCO don’t realize the extent to which it depends on the ESTC. Users of ECCO also might not know how many eighteenth-century items it lacks. The ESTC contains over 340,000 eighteenth-century records; ECCO has about 180,000.5 ECCO contains searchable images of the books’ contents, which is especially desired in our search-crazed digital culture. Like ECCO, Google Books has searchable, digitized images, but unlike ECCO, it is free. Google, however, has for some unknown reason neglected to catalogue exactly what was being scanned from books held by the Bodleian Library, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, the New York Public Library, and other libraries. If, therefore, scholars want to know which eighteenth-century editions of Tom Jones appear in Google Books, they had better be prepared to embark on their own bibliographical quest because Google has made no effort to match what it has scanned to standard bibliographical reference tools, including the ESTC. In contrast, ECCO can be directly searched using ESTC numbers, and in the summer of 2011 the ESTC added links to ECCO. Bibliographically minded scholars trying to exploit the great resources of Google Books are currently forced “to tread the dreary paths without a guide.”6  (284)
p.284: So on the one hand, the ESTC has become more widely available and accessible than ever before. On the other hand, it appears to have been superseded by full-text databases, one of which costs a considerable amount of money to access.
Indeed, writing about the ESTC means acknowledging its omissions, errors, and inconsistencies. Many of these problems have been discussed in a series of essays over the last two decades, two of the most detailed of which are by James E. May. May has found many instances in which the ESTC does not identify a book as being a reissue of another edition; such an omission might cause a scholar to assume that the book had not been published before this reissue. He also found many pagination errors, inconsistencies in recording frontispieces, numerous errors in linking individual copies to the appropriate editions, outdated information regarding attribution, unreported copies at libraries that generally reported their holdings to the ESTC, and distinct editions that appear nowhere in the catalogue. His conclusion is a sobering one: “there is a one-in-three or -four likelihood of finding in the ESTC record an error or serious oversight in the description, in the item’s identity relative to other recorded items, or in the copies listed.” (285)
While researching this article, I discovered a small number of errors regarding bibliographical format. Some of these would be amusing to bibliographers, who know that formats such as 3o, 5o, 6o, 7o, and 9o do not exist.8 (All of the errors I found have since been fixed.) Some of these minor mistakes probably resulted from transcription errors (285)
“We spent an awful lot of time recording stuff manually. And for some years we put this all down on sheets of paper and keyed it in later. Because even though the British Library was building machine-readable files, everything was done manually and sent to a typing service and then keyed in by a typing service. That’s why there are so many, there were tens of thousands of errors created by that typing service. They’re still in there; we’re still getting them out.9 “	9.	Daniel J. Slive, “Exit Interview: Henry Snyder,” RBM 2, no. 1 (2001): 73–92, on p. 86. 
“A broken record occurs when information added to a record has not been checked against the copies already listed under that record” (Karian 285)

Tabor’s discussion offers one answer to James May’s pressing question, “Who will edit the ESTC?” The answer seems to be: users will. Now when viewing an ESTC record, users can click on the “Error Report Form” and describe the errors they have noticed. Such reports do in fact generate a helpful and timely response, as I have discovered after making a series of reports that elicited responses from Simon May at the British Library. One hopes that the British Library staff will be able to handle the volume of submitted error reports so that the accuracy and completeness of the ESTC file will continue to improve. But posting these corrections can’t fix the ESTC, because so many errors and inconsistencies pervade the file.  (286) 
Why then did my search using the “Word(s) anywhere” field not find any of these records? 
Upon closer inspection, I saw that all of these records contain references to “not in Foxon” in the Uncontrolled note, which is MARC field 509.12 For the results of my initial search, all the references to “not in Foxon” appeared in the General note (MARC field 500) or Citation/references (MARC field 510), sometimes in addition to the Uncontrolled note. It seems, then, that informa- tion in the Uncontrolled note can be viewed but not searched. I don’t under- stand why this distinction would be made for a freely available online database that is undergoing constant revision. The Uncontrolled note is presumably a field for information that still needs to be verified (the ESTC’s help page does not mention this field at all), but the tentative nature of the information in this field could be indicated and the relevant information should be accessible to users’ searches. As long as information in the Uncon- trolled note is unavailable to searching, users will be prevented from exploring the full resources of the ESTC.13  (287)
“Only a thorough and  / painstaking search through all 1,255 records would reveal exactly how manyof them are Foxon items that do not appear in Foxon. Given that all of thisinformation has already been digitized, conducting such a search is anunnecessary expenditure of scholarly energy” (287-288)
This example demonstrates not only some limitations of the ESTC, but also the existence of two ESTC interfaces, one publicly available with some information visible but not searchable, the other available on a limited basis. This example also reveals a serious inconsistency in the way miscellaneous information has been stored. (288)
To consider fully the limitations and possibilities of the ESTC requires examining it as a database rather than merely as a large-scale online library catalogue. And here is where the ESTC promises to be especially important, given recent interests in using quantitative information to study literary and cultural history. When applied to book production, this approach is sometimes referred to as bibliometric analysis, an approach that should expand our knowledge of publishing history in a way that was previously impossible. These projects may well challenge widely held views that are based more on legend and assumption than on fact. Recent illuminating examples of such approaches include Franco Moretti’s graphical analysis of the rises and falls of the novel in nations throughout the world, David L. Gants’s study of the early seventeenth-century book trade, and Steven N. Zwicker’s exploration of the category of Restoration literature.16 With its extensive collection of data, the ESTC promises to be an essential resource for similar investigations. (289)
However, two key problems with the ESTC’s structure and its data will vex any effort to use the database for such purposes. The first problem relates to the unit of classification. A clearly defined unit is necessary to ensure that a study of change over time is reliable and based on consistent terms. What is the unit that the ESTC uses? Scholars sometimes answer by using the terms “edition,” “issue,” or “title” interchangeably. But since the ESTC does not rely in a consistent manner on any of these terms for its unit of classification, one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC. (289)
An edition (using the bibliographical meaning of an edition) encompasses all copies printed from essentially the same setting of type. An edition of a book may be reissued, perhaps with a new title-page referring to a “second edition” or a “corrected edition.” Despite the claims on the title-page, however, this new “edition” is not a new edition at all if the setting of type has not significantly changed. In these situations, bibliographers would refer to multiple issues of the same edition. A title is an ambiguous and nonbibliographic term, possibly referring to all editions of a particular work (all editions of Hamlet, for example) or to a publication with a specifically phrased title. (289)
For the most part, the ESTC contains a record for each issue (289)
The ESTC’s practice of handling multi-volume sets is highly variable, sometimes assigning one record for an entire set, sometimes one record for each volume, and sometimes for both the set and each volume. Reissues of individual volumes complicate this kind of situation even further. … The ESTC’s somewhat ad hoc method of assigning multiple records in these instances stems from the complexity of the bibliographical situation.17 Anyone who studies early printed books for a brief but intense period will quickly learn that it is no simple matter to untangle the knots of multiple issues and states. In addition, the ESTC’s use of multiple records often assists cataloguers trying to match their holdings to the ESTC. It is much easier to compare a title- page to its ESTC transcription than it is to investigate the history of a work’s multiple editions, issues, and states. But the consequence of this ease of use for cataloguers is that the database cannot serve the interests of certain areas of scholarly inquiry. Because of the highly variable meaning of the term “ESTC record,” the results of any large-scale search cannot be reliably compared to the results of another search.  (290)
“the only way to avoid such a problem with the ESTC in its current form is to check every single record of a search, an astonishingly laborious process.” (291)
And none of this gets us any closer to an appropriate unit of classification. Even if the ESTC used a bibliographically defined “edition” as its unit, a broadsheet would be treated as equivalent to a 1,000-page volume, an equivalence that would usually distort our understanding of publishing trends. One way to avoid using such an equivalence would be to adopt the unit of the “edition sheet” for the number of sheets of paper needed to produce one copy of the edition. Thus a broadsheet would be equivalent to a sixteen- page octavo edition.19 This unit still cannot tell us how many copies of each edition were printed—the evidence for such information is usually lost to us— nor can it tell us how many readers there were for each copy. But it would certainly offer a standard definition that could be used in a comparative manner and allow us at last to compare apples to apples. An ideally con- structed ESTC would be multidimensional in a way that would allow users to select a preferred unit of classification and change it at will. (291)
The second problem with using the ESTC to investigate publishing patterns derives from how it dates books whose imprints lack dates of publication. Dates in an ESTC record appear in two MARC fields: 008 and 260. A search for a particular year will find a record with that year in either of these fields. The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records—for example, everything from 1720—there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720, such as items known to have been published in 1721 before March 25 (those records read “1720 [i.e. 1721]”); items with uncertain dates (namely records dated somewhere around 1720); or items with dates given in a range in which 1720 is on one end of that range. If, therefore, one wants to find the total number of records that can be confidently dated to a particular year, one should expect a degree of overcounting. (291)
The years 1720 and 1730 (and to a somewhat lesser extent 1725) contain more total records than the other years represented in this table, and they also contain significantly more records of uncertain dates. The major fluctuations in this table do not necessarily reveal anything about publishing patterns in this decade, but rather the manner in which ESTC records are dated when their dates of publication are not known: they are assigned to the closest year possible, which often means the year at the nearest five- or ten-year interval (in this respect, the ESTC follows British Library cataloguing rules). Thus any study of changes over time will reveal artificial “peaks” in the data at five- and especially ten-year intervals, which in turn will vitiate efforts to study press production within a narrowly defined window. (292)
Clearly, MARC records were not originally designed for early printed books. Therefore the use of MARC records is an uncomfortable fit with the kinds of items the ESTC catalogues. It seems to me that the only way to improve the ESTC as a database would be to supplement MARC records with another database structure.  (293)

            <Text>The English Short Title Catalogue began as the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue in the 1970s, operating in a similar line as the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640 and Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700. These catalogues established the ambitious simplicity of the ESTC: to accurately describe every edition of every printed work in English or from the United Kingdom. The Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue began properly in 1976, at a conference jointly sponsored by the British Library and the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies (Crump 106). Here, “bibliographers and librarians attempted both to arrive at a consensus of the size of the task and the methodology that would have to be adopted to achieve a union catalogue. However, until the works were catalogued, it would not be possible to answer basic questions (such as the potential number of extant items) which would predetermine working methods. The very fact that they found it difficult to agree for want of sound and accepted figures indicated the need for ESTC.” (Crump 105). A pilot project began at the British Library in 1977, under the direction of Robin Alston (Crump 105). Unlike earlier Short-Title Catalogues, which appeared as lengthly print publications, the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue was conceived as digital from the beginning — a decision which, as Karian notes, “exhibited considerable foresight” (283) in the 1970s. As a result, “ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work” (Karian 283).  Robin Alston and Mervyn Jannetta developed their own cataloguing rules, distinct from the Library of Congress MARC and UK MARC standards (Korshin 211). Once these standards were established, the British Library began to re-catalogue its own holdings, and in 1979 libraries in the United States, Germany, and Australia undertook to supplement them. In these international collaborations, “Where ESTC records already existed, these were adopted as the [new] record and only those works not held in the ESTC base file were catalogued again” (Crump 105).</Text>

He said the Lyrical Ballads were an experiment about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been attempted, and making use only of such words as had probably been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.”</Text>

            <Title>object of study &amp; BLUF</Title>
            <Text>This chapter will describe the primary object of study of this dissertation, namely, contemporary digital databases with substantial holdings of 1790s literature. These databases require substantial description, preliminary to analysis, since they have conventionally been treated as tools for accessing objects of study, rather than objects of study in themselves. Figure &lt;$n:fig:databases-venn&gt; shows a venn diagram of the approximate relative scale, and overlap in holdings, of the eight databases in three ecosystems which I will explore. In blue is the purely academic ecosystem: the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and the ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP). In pink is the commercial Google-backed ecosystem: Google Books, Google Ngrams, and HathiTrust. And in green is a crowdsourced ecosystem: Project Gutenberg. The division of databases into these ecosystems represents my own analysis of the institutional processes and selection principles which have shaped them. Databases within a shared ecosystem may or may not be interoperable, but they made their initial textual selections with a similar logic, and make make their holdings available for a similar imagined audience. An immediate difference between them, for example, is that the commercial ecosystem treats textual holdings like a trade secret; my discussion of Google Books and Google Ngrams will be primarily a discussion of barriers and lacunae. Google Books and Google Ngrams are of crucial importance, however, for understanding HathiTrust, whose presence in my diagram of the commercial ecosystem runs counter to its current highly academic reputation. This chapter will begin with a discussion of the theoretical stakes involved in taking a system of databases as one’s object of study. To illustrate these states, I will examine the current scope and data structure of each database, and the holdings of works by Charlotte Smith that each contains. Then I will present a chronological history of these nine databases. The chapter concludes by returning to this map of database ecosystems, to examine the role of commercial forces in defining each of the three clusters. As I will show, these resources are different in their core assumptions — so different it can even be difficult to bring them into simple comparison with each other — as a result of three different strategies of response to the economic forces of the emerging internet.</Text>

            <Text>Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical — or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream” — printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a taxonomy of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and of authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, and what kind of “alternatives” they offer to the mainstream. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices within the horizon of expectations of the radical circles I (and other scholars) expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.
TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.
TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.</Comments>

            <Text>Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of text-mining research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of corpora which re-create social inequalities. I examine five corpora which are used as the basis of most eighteenth century distant reading. I manually evaluate each corpus’s holdings for works published in England 1789-99, to answer a series of bibliographical questions, including: how many titles are by men, by women, or unsigned? What broad categories of writing are represented — novels, plays, poetry, pamphlets, songs, sermons, ephemera, others? Analyzing the differences, I ask: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women?</Text>

            <Title>we need Venn</Title>
            <Text>Drawing together three scholarly conversations with three distinct histories — the digital humanities, the literary canons of 1790s, and reparative reading — it is difficult to attentively delineate the links and the tensions between each thread. Especially since many of these fields have, in fact, overlapped substantially, there is a danger of simplistically conflating distinct lines of thoughts. At the same time, over-emphasis on distinctions can overstate the separations between fields which do in fact (as the existence of this dissertation contents) share important affinities. To navigate these conceptual overlaps carefully, let us make our way through each area of an imagined Venn diagram of the three. We can discuss each pair in turn — DH and eighteenth century studies; eighteenth century studies and queer theory; queer theory and DH — to make our way toward the centre where all three overlap.</Text>
            <Comments>I think perhaps the key for this section is not to do "1790s" but . - printing and canons in 1790s (and recognize they need to be separate as well as intersecting)

            <Title>ch 5 - Gothic</Title>
            <Text>My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being “unserious” (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about “redeeming literary value” in the Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>background</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.</Text>

Of the 47 editions printed in England between 1784 and 1807, 42 are included in the ESTC, and 5 do not appear in the ESTC because they were printed after 1800 and thus fall outside its purview. ECCO contains 37 of Smith’s 47 editions, all of which also appear in the ESTC. ECCO is missing the 5 editions not listed in the ESTC (since it, too, does not contain works past 1800), as well as another 5 works. HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith’s 47 editions, but unlike ECCO, these are not a simple subset of the ESTC. HathiTrust contains one of the 5 editions excluded from the ESTC, and one of the 5 editions included in ESTC but excluded from ECCO. The remaining 16 HathiTrust editions appear in both the ESTC and ECCO. ECCO-TCP includes only 2 of Smith’s 47 editions, both of which appear in every previous database.

            <Title>computation reveals assumptions</Title>
            <Text>Love’s later article, “Close Reading and Thin Description,” provides a more precise articulation of the kind of close reading that she calls for, in which an “exhaustive, fine-grained attention to phenomena” (404) enables “taking up the position of the device; by turning oneself into a camera, one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully” (407). Although Love is uninterested in “distant reading” as synonymous with Moretti (Love 411), this invocation of the mechanical implies, I argue, an obvious potential for computation. The actual practice of computational research requires a great deal of laborious, intimate encoding. The researcher must occupy a “mechanical” position of receiving inputs and responding to them consistently over time, whether entering details in a spreadsheet with a consistent taxonomy or running the same program over multiple datasets. Love says:
Good descriptions are in a sense rich, but not because they truck with imponderables like human experience or human nature. They are close, but they are not deep; rather than adding anything ‘extra’ to the description, they account for the real variety that is already there. (377)
A computational model is unlikely to “truck with imponderables,” but it absolutely must “account for the real variety that is already there” or else the code will simply fail to run. If you are forced to manually encode your assumptions into a system, you are forced to confront what they are. Even deleting or ignoring information is still a way of “accounting for” it in the coding process: some part of the program will have to say, in effect, ‘if I get an input that doesn’t match what I expect, discard it.’ Choosing to ignore contradictory or difficult information carries the assumption that this information does not ‘count,’ or does not matter to the question at hand. The choice faced by scholars is how to address our encoded assumptions. The encounter with variety does not in itself produce nuanced results: it is possible to selectively ignore any uncomfortable details. But it is also possible to do computation reflectively, asking not “how can I make this work the way I want?” but “where do my assumptions encounter resistance?” and turning one’s attention to the nature of the resistance. Integrating this reflection into the research process can allow a scholar to avoid both the pitfalls of “conquering” their material and of claiming an algorithmic grasp of “objective” truth. </Text>
            <Comments>Appendix B (“Methodology”) contains many examples of these algorithmic procedures executed by the human researcher and the computational programs in concert. The act of writing a program is an iterative process of delegation.</Comments>

            <Text>Minard is actually making a strong and brutal argument in his chart -- against war, against Napoleon, and against history as the biography of celebrity. I need to do a lot of actual research first, to figure out what I think is true, and why I think it, but I will know that I have succeeded, I think, if I can produce something half so rich and persuasive.

Right now this means that I am throwing out my current dissertation outline, which separates things based on which corpus I am pulling my information from. I will describe my methods in the most voluminous appendices the department has ever seen if I must (and I strongly suspect that, in the end, I must) but I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.

I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.</Text>

            <Text>A “corpus” is a body that cries out for Frankenstein metaphor: a collection of disparate parts, joined together and then animated to fend for themselves. This metaphor is sufficiently apt and illuminating that it is worth attending to Victor Frankenstein’s exact design principles as he built his own corpus:
As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began. (CITE FRANKENSTEIN)
Important details: Victor makes a questionable design choice due to challenges with his source materials. (Victor’s ambitions, in the future scholarship he hopes to seed, are also perhaps uncomfortably familiar)</Text>

            <Title>felski, surface readers</Title>
            <Text>I have mentioned moving away from critique as well as from paranoia: in rethinking the role of critique, I draw upon the work of Rita Felski, and the theories of “surface reading” described by Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, and Heather Love. Felski, in her article “After Suspicion” and then further in her monograph The Limits of Critique, seeks to attend seriously to literary attachments, including our own attachments as critics. Felski’s approach to these attachments is essentially sociological, drawing heavily on Bruno Latour’s actor-network-theory, and thus involves almost no close reading. “Surface reading” positions itself as an alternative to “symptomatic reading”; rather than seeking to expose hidden truths concealed within texts, it attempts accurate descriptions that “make visible what is invisible only because it's too much on the surface of things” (Best 13). The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but not perfect: all paranoid reading is symptomatic, but not all symptomatic reading is paranoid. Reparative reading, as described by Sedgwick, is often still interested in ‘deep’ meanings of texts, in which striking textual features can be interpreted to locate additional meanings. Felski’s readings are often symptomatic in this way. In contrast, “surface reading,” as Heather Love describes, pursues “a turn away from the singularity and richness of individual texts” (374), seeking descriptions that are “complex and variegated, but not rich, warm, or deep” (378). Love’s disavowal of “richness” here is part of her attempt to move away from “the ethical charisma of the literary translator or messenger” (374) who characterizes the paranoid, critical figure that both Sedgwick and Felski also seek to escape.</Text>

This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expanding audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3 </Text>

            <Text>Chapter four uses Ann Radcliffe as an important contrast to Charlotte Smith and especially to Mary Robinson, to challenge the ease with which the number of unique titles can stand in for both “popularity” and “importance.” Taking as my premise that Radcliffe was unquestionably both popular and important in the 1790s, I examine the extent to which she does (or does not) rise to attention within my corpora of that decade. I explore both print runs and reviews as important supplementary forms of information, and prototype and test computational methods to integrate these kinds of information with more accessible metadata. Print runs are of particular importance to interpreting Radcliffe’s career, since a large run of one edition can represent far more actual books produced than several small editions, and Radcliffe’s celebrity often meant large print runs. To compare her output to Smith’s and Robinson’s, I test and compare a few methods of calculating the total number of books printed for each author during the decade. To compare her reception to theirs, I hope to use a prototype version of Megan Peiser’s in-progress Novels Reviewed Database. In both cases, my method will begin with manually researching the three authors’ major works, and then exploring scalable computational methods. The chapter closes, again, with a reflection on Radcliffe as an author.</Text>

            <Title>intro - archive formation</Title>
            <Text>My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade.
My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, I will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty.
My subject matter situates me in a densely-discussed intersection of scholarly fields.

The years 1789-99 make an eleven-year “decade” delimited by the major events of the French Revolution, but also home to a crucial literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form. 
18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernacular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. 
The introduction will also address who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.
(How do I define my geographical area? England, or “Britain”? I could just focus on London; even if I try not to, I suspect actually nearly everything will end up being from London.) </Text>

            <Text>A particularly interesting text which might reward a study of both its timeliness and its use of feeling is Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, which was first published in 1766 but continued to be frequently reprinted in the 1790s. The persistence of Wakefield immediately undermines any literary history which wholly relegates the sentimental novel to the 1760s and 1770s. However, by the 1790s Wakefield is no longer competing with The Man of Feeling (which many of its former dedicated readers now regarded with embarassment), and instead was read alongside the contemporary literature of sensibility in the Gothic mode. There is much still to be uncovered about how readers in the 1790s made very different sense of this work’s political and religious sermons, dramatic and moving prison scenes, and moralizing love-plot.</Text>

            <Text>“Out-of-print books, almost by definition, were commercial dead weight. If Google, through mass digitization, could make a new market for them, that would be a real victory for authors and publishers. “We realized there was an opportunity to do something extraordinary for readers and academics in this country,” Richard Sarnoff, who was then Chairman of the American Association of Publishers, said at the time. “We realized that we could light up the out-of-print backlist of this industry for two things: discovery and consumption.” But once you had that goal in mind, the lawsuit itself—which was about whether Google could keep scanning and displaying snippets—began to seem small time. Suppose the Authors Guild won: they were unlikely to recoup anything more than the statutory minimum in damages; and what good would it do to stop Google from providing snippets of old books? If anything those snippets might drive demand. And suppose Google won: Authors and publishers would get nothing, and all readers would get for out-of-print books would be snippets—not access to full texts. The plaintiffs, in other words, had gotten themselves into a pretty unusual situation. They didn’t want to lose their own lawsuit—but they didn’t want to win it either.” (Somers)
”The basic problem with out-of-print books is that it’s unclear who owns most of them. An author might have signed a book deal with their publisher 40 years ago; that contract stipulated that the rights revert to the author after the book goes out of print, but required the author to send a notice to that effect, and probably didn’t say anything about digital rights; and all this was recorded on some pieces of paper that nobody has.” (Somers)

“At the heart of the settlement was a collective licensing regime for out-of-print books. Authors and publishers could opt out their books at any time. For those who didn’t, Google would be given wide latitude to display and sell their books, but in return, 63 percent of the revenues would go into escrow with a new entity called the Book Rights Registry. The Registry’s job would be to distribute funds to rightsholders as they came forward to claim their works; in ambiguous cases, part of the money would be used to figure out who actually owned the rights.” (Somers)

“Book publishing isn’t the healthiest industry in the world, and individual authors don’t make any money out of out-of-print books,” Cunard said to me. “Not that they would have made gazillions of dollars” with Google Books and the Registry, “but they would at least have been paid something for it. And most authors actually want their books to be read.” What became known as the Google Books Search Amended Settlement Agreement came to 165 pages and more than a dozen appendices. It took two and a half years to hammer out the details. Sarnoff described the negotiations as “four-dimensional chess” between the authors, publishers, libraries, and Google. “Everyone involved,” he said to me, “and I mean everyone—on all sides of this issue—thought that if we were going to get this through, this would be the single most important thing they did in their careers.””

“The objections came in many flavors, but they all started with the sense that the settlement was handing to Google, and Google alone, an awesome power. “Did we want the greatest library that would ever exist to be in the hands of one giant corporation, which could really charge almost anything it wanted for access to it?”, Robert Darnton, then president of Harvard’s library, has said. Darnton had initially been supportive of Google’s scanning project, but the settlement made him wary. The scenario he and many others feared was that the same thing that had happened to the academic journal market would happen to the Google Books database.” (Somers)
“Amazon, for its part, worried that the settlement allowed Google to set up a bookstore that no one else could. Anyone else who wanted to sell out-of-print books, they argued, would have to clear rights on a book-by-book basis, which was as good as impossible, whereas the class action agreement gave Google a license to all of the books at once. This objection got the attention of the Justice Department, in particular the Antitrust division, who began investigating the settlement. In a statement filed with the court, the DOJ argued that the settlement would give Google a de facto monopoly on out-of-print books. That’s because for Google’s competitors to get the same rights to those books, they’d basically have to go through the exact same bizarre process: scan them en masse, get sued in a class action, and try to settle. … Google’s best defense was that the whole point of antitrust law was to protect consumers” (Somers)
“No one is quite sure why the DOJ decided to take a stand instead of remaining neutral. Dan Clancy, the Google engineering lead on the project who helped design the settlement, thinks that it was a particular brand of objector—not Google’s competitors but “sympathetic entities” you’d think would be in favor of it, like library enthusiasts, academic authors, and so on—that ultimately flipped the DOJ. “I don’t know how the settlement would have transpired if those naysayers hadn’t been so vocal,” he told me. “It’s not clear to me that if the libraries and the Bob Darntons and the Pam Samuelsons of the world hadn’t been so active that the Justice Department ever would have become involved, because it just would have been Amazon and Microsoft bitching about Google. Which is like yeah, tell me something new.”” (Somers)
”The irony is that so many people opposed the settlement in ways that suggested they fundamentally believed in what Google was trying to do. One of Pamela Samuelson’s main objections was that Google was going to be able to sell books like hers, whereas she thought they should be made available for free. …  In her paper concluding that the settlement went too far, Samuelson herself even wrote, “It would be a tragedy not to try to bring this vision to fruition, now that it is so evident that the vision is realizable.”” (Somers)

““This is not important enough for the Congress to somehow adjust copyright law,” Clancy said. “It’s not going to get anyone elected. It’s not going to create a whole bunch of jobs.” It’s no coincidence that a class action against Google turned out to be perhaps the only plausible venue for this kind of reform: Google was the only one with the initiative, and the money, to make it happen. “If you want to look at this in a raw way,” Allan Adler, in-house counsel for the publishers, said to me, “a deep pocketed, private corporate actor was going to foot the bill for something that everyone wanted to see.” Google poured resources into the project, not just to scan the books but to dig up and digitize old copyright records, to negotiate with authors and publishers, to foot the bill for a Books Rights Registry. Years later, the Copyright Office has gotten nowhere with a proposal that re-treads much the same ground, but whose every component would have to be funded with Congressional appropriations.”(Somers)

“It was strange to me, the idea that somewhere at Google there is a database containing 25-million books and nobody is allowed to read them. It’s like that scene at the end of the first Indiana Jones movie where they put the Ark of the Covenant back on a shelf somewhere, lost in the chaos of a vast warehouse. It’s there. The books are there. People have been trying to build a library like this for ages—to do so, they’ve said, would be to erect one of the great humanitarian artifacts of all time—and here we’ve done the work to make it real and we were about to give it to the world and now, instead, it’s 50 or 60 petabytes on disk, and the only people who can see it are half a dozen engineers on the project who happen to have access because they’re the ones responsible for locking it up. I asked someone who used to have that job, what would it take to make the books viewable in full to everybody? I wanted to know how hard it would have been to unlock them. What’s standing between us and a digital public library of 25 million volumes? You’d get in a lot of trouble, they said, but all you’d have to do, more or less, is write a single database query. You’d flip some access control bits from off to on. It might take a few minutes for the command to propagate.” (Somers)</Text>

            <Title>Mee: is LCS literature?</Title>
            <Text>John Mee: Print, Publicity, and Popular Radicalism in the 1790s. Although his title leaves open the possibility that he could consider any kind of writing in print, Mee is concerned solely with the activities of the London Corresponding Society, placed in the context of Romanticism. He examines “public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS’s name” (28). Mee sidesteps the question of whether the texts he studies are ‘literature.’ A partial claim to the status of ‘literature’ is suggested by the participation of his book within the series ‘Cambridge Studies in Romanticism,’ which, he acknowledges “implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of ‘literary’ culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies” (18). Nonetheless, the book distances itself from “Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights” (18). Mee thus replicates the way that the period’s definitely-literary “poets, novelists, and playwrights” sought to put distance between themselves and the potentially sub-literary “role of print personality as a form of mediation” (29) that interests Mee in the LCS.</Text>
            <Comments>“this formation and the associated identification of the literary with what John Thelwall called ‘sallies of the imagination’ were the product of a crisis brought on by the emergence of the popular radical culture opened up in this book, but the story is not a straightforward one. Thelwall himself could identify ‘literature’ both with a domain of imagination separable from politics and with print as the principal engine of emancipatory change.” (Mee 18)
By this, Mee means “both attacks on personalities by the radical press but also the development of personae by writers and booksellers” \cite{Mee:2016wk p.29}.</Comments>

            <Title>Facer, Ruth. Bio of Radcliffe</Title>
            <Text>”According to The Edinburgh Review (May 1823), ‘She never appeared in public, nor mingled in private society, but kept herself apart, like the sweet bird that sings its solitary notes, shrouded and unseen’. In fact, so little was known about Radcliffe’s life in the nineteenth century that Christina Rossetti abandoned a projected biography due to a lack of material” (Facer).
“We do know, however, that Ann Ward Radcliffe was born in Holborn, London, on 9 July 1764. She was the only child of William Ward, a haberdasher, and his wife Ann Oates. Her mother was relatively well connected. Oates’s cousin was Sir Richard Jebb, physician to George III, while her brother-in-law, Thomas Bentley, was the partner of Josiah Wedgwood. In 1772, William Ward moved with his wife and young daughter to Bath, where he would manage a china shop partly owned by Wedgwood. The young Ann was reasonably well educated… In 1787 Ann married William Radcliffe, a hardworking Oxford law graduate who became part-editor and owner of The English Chronicle. He often came home late and in order to occupy her time, Radcliffe began to write, reading aloud the lines she had written during the day on his return.”
“The Radcliffes’ marriage, though childless, appears to have been happy. In her Preface to A Journey made in the Summer of 1794 through Holland and the Western Frontiers of Germany (1795) Radcliffe touchingly referred to her husband as her ‘nearest relative and friend’ and acknowledged that the account of the journey had ‘been written so much from their mutual observation, that there would be a deception in permitting the book to appear, without some acknowledgement, which may distinguish it from works entirely her own’. The couple loved travelling together and used some of the money made from the publication of Radcliffe’s novels to finance their trips.”
“Like her novels, Radcliffe’s last years are shrouded in mystery. She was said to be depressed in 1797. By the end of her life, rumours abounded that she had become insane as a result of her Gothic fantasies and had been incarcerated in a Derbyshire asylum. The truth may never be known. Radcliffe had suffered from asthma for the past twelve years and her death on 7 February 1823 may well have been the result of a fatal attack. Talfourd’s Memoir of the Author, undoubtedly written under the instruction of Radcliffe’s husband, categorically denies that she was insane: ‘while some spoke of her as dead, and others represented her as afflicted with mental alienation, she was thankfully enjoying the choicest of blessings of life’. Her doctor issued a statement after her death, maintaining that she was in perfect mental health. Ann Radcliffe was buried in a vault in the Chapel of Ease belonging to St. George’s, Hanover Square, in Bayswater, London.” (Facer)</Text>

            <Text>When working with large literary databases, scholars naturally wish to know what kind of literature they are working with. A high incidence of religious language in an eighteenth century corpus, for example, will mean something different depending on how many of the documents included in the corpus are sermons. However, the larger and more heterogenous the database, the less likely it is that all of its contents have been thoroughly and consistently identified. Eighteenth century texts predate systems such as the Library of Congress subject headings, so many of the holdings in widely-used resources such as the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) include no metadata regarding their contents’ subject matter.</Text>

            <Title>OCR accuracy</Title>
            <Text>I started by testing just The Emigrants. To get the text without the XML markup, I viewed it at https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004801766.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext and simply copy-pasted the page into a plaintext file, manually deleting the header and footer website text so that the file only contained the poem. I saved it as emigrants-TCO-OCR.txt.
I attempted to download the HathiTrust edition by going to the “text-only view of this item” at https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ssd?id=uc1.31175035214942;page=ssd;view=plaintext;seq=15;num=ix, where I discovered that I only had “one page at a time access to this item,” even though it was correctly identified under “Rights” as a public domain work. Authenticating through the University of Toronto gave me access to the full work. This page came with the warning “Use of this online version is subject to all U.S. copyright laws. Please do not save or redistribute this file,” which I disregarded under Fair Use to save a personal research copy of the text. Again the easiest method was to copy-paste the page into a plaintext file and delete unnecessary headers. I deleted “Book Text - Front Cover” and everything above, and “End of Section 9” and below, and saved the file as emigrants-Hathi-OCR.txt.
To download the ECCO OCR file, I went to the new Gale Digital Scholar Labs portal (since ECCO itself does not make the OCR available). The “basic search” very annoyingly attempted to autocomplete my search for “the emigrants” to unrelated terms, like “henry the eighth” and “female emigrants”. The “advanced search” did the same, changing “the emigrants” to “therefore” and “mall of the emirates.” Eventually, I was able to find the desired text by searching “the emigrants” as document title and “charlotte smith” as author. Gale Digital Scholar Labs prominently assigns an “OCR Confidence” of 95% to the record. The viewer did not give me 95% confidence. This method of accessing the text was the first to offer a download of the OCR. I downloaded it with their tool, examine the file, and deleted the disclaimer about OCR which appeared at the top, then renamed the file emigrants-ECCO-OCR.txt to match the other files.
At this point I was ready to load the files into Juxta. I signed in to Juxta Commons (at http://juxtacommons.org/home/index) to use the web interface, and uploaded all three files as “sources.” I prepared all three as “witnesses,” then created a “comparison set” of “Emigrants OCRs” with them and collated. It took a long time to collate, and then I discovered that, unfortunately, whichever file appears first (in this case, the ECCO file) is taken as the “base” to compare the others to, and I couldn’t determine how the base could be changed. I deleted the ECCO and Hathi witnesses from the set, then dragged them back in to it, to place them below the TCP witness. This caused unexpected server errors and failed, so I deleted the whole set, then created a new one with just the TCP witness and tried again. This worked, but the ECCO witness was immediately listed about the TCP witness, presumably due to alphabetization. I created a new witness from my TCP source, naming it beginning with A, and added that to the comparison set, then collated. To my surprise, Juxa calculated a relatively low “change index” for each text compared to the TCP witness: ECCO had a .16 change from base (i.e., 84% accuracy), and HathiTrust a .29 change from base (i.e., 71% accuracy).
Since some of HathiTrust’s inaccuracy may come from the fact that it uses the ſ character whereas TCP modernizes this to an s, I then ran a second experiment. Using “find and replace” in TextWrangler, I changed all 1278 instances of ſ in the HathiTrust file to s, and saved this as a new file, emigrants-Hathi-OCR-regularized.txt. I uploaded this to Juxta as a new source and witness for the same set. In doing so, it became clear that Juxta takes whatever the newest witness is as the “base,” so I had to delete/recreate my TCP witness again to make it the base. Once I got this working, the new HathiTrust copy had only a .09 difference from the TCP copy — for 91% accuracy!</Text>

            <Text>Reading Feeling, Writing Timeliness:
Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature
To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two contentious elements of literature, the complex and variable interrelationship of which my study foregrounds, are feeling and timeliness. Both concepts shape eighteenth century writing, and my approach to it. “Feeling” as a central idea refers both to the literature of sensibility as an evolving counterpoint to enlightenment rationalism, and to contemporary processes of reparative reading which foreground the limits of scholarly critique. “Timeliness” encompasses both the urgent responses of the eighteenth century mediascape to a perceived historical rupture, and to an exhaustively particular methodology of historicized textual study. Although my project remains quantitative and computational in its technological foundations, my central interest remains with the field of eighteenth century studies, rather than the field of the digital humanities.</Text>

            <Text>Gothic and Romantic engagements he critical reception of Ann Radcliffe, 1789–1850 
Dale Townshend and Angela Wright 

“the numerous obituaries published in Britain in the months following the writer’s death indicate the considerable esteem in which Ann Radcliffe was held in 1823, a fact that seems all the more remarkable in view of the twenty-six years of creative silence that had prevailed since the publication of her fifth novel” (3)

Mingled with Scott even in her reclusiveness: “The Edinburgh Review in May 1823 seized the opportunity occasioned by Radcliffe’s recent demise in order to pay touching tribute to the writer in an extended footnote: ‘The fair authoress kept herself almost as much incognito as the Author of Waverley’” (Townshend and Wright 3)

“he nonetheless takes care to defend the unquestionable genius of Ann Radcliffe on at least three accounts: her presiding over ‘a separate and distinct species of writing’ (Scott 1824: xx); her ability to sustain her readers’ interest and attention across three major novels … / … and her exploration of extreme human passions in appropriately southern European settings” (Townshend and Wright 5-6)

“In the twenty-six years between the publication of he Italian and her death in early 1823, Ann Radcliffe entered what, for many of her readers and critics, was a profound and enduring creative interregnum. hough it was partially broken by the unauthorised publication of Poems by Mrs Ann Radcliffe in 1816, the material contained therein was largely an anthologisa- tion of most (but not all) of the poetry that had already been published in Athlin and Dunbayne, A Sicilian Romance, he Romance of the Forest and Udolpho and thus not, in effect, a new production by the author’s pen at all.” (Townshend and Wright 13)

“Irrespective of the various ways in which she was aligned with cultural heritage, that Ann Radcliffe even figured in a line of otherwise exclusively male writers was, in itself, both significant and extraordinary, for, since its inception in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the discourse of original genius had primarily served as a category somewhat narrowly reserved for men.” (Townshend and Wright 18)</Text>

            <Title>defining terms</Title>
            <Text>For the purposes of this chapter, I examine Smith’s works which fall outside this dissertation’s decade of interest. As Table &lt;$n#table:Smith-4dbs&gt; shows, Smith’s publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith’s “full” output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. Her 1790s output (that is, the editions published 1789-99) consists of 30 of those editions.  I have slightly expanded my chronological focus in part because some of the most interesting exclusions occur earlier and later in Smith’s publishing career, such as the first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), which is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere, or the publications in the last years of her life, which are excluded from the chronological focus of most resources but can still appear in HathiTrust. Of particular interest is the fact that Beachy Head, which is now one of Smith’s most frequently anthologized and taught poems, does not appear in a single digital database. None of these inclusions or exclusions represent an agenda against (or for) Smith, or indeed an interpretive choice at all, but they nonetheless shape the disciplinary infrastructure.</Text>

            <Title>Bruhm - Gothic Novel &amp; Homophobia</Title>
            <Text>“the equation that critics of the “gay and lesbian Gothic” have understood to be present in the genre since its inception in the 1760s: that is, in Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s often-quoted assertion that “[t]he Gothic novel crystallized for English audiences the terms of a dialectic between homosexuality and homophobia, in which homophobia appeared thematically in paranoid plots” (92)” (p 272)
“ Locating the rise of that paranoid plot within the narratives of three Gothic novelists who were each “in some significant sense homosexual – Beckford notoriously, Lewis probably, Walpole iffily” (92), Sedgwick’s Between Men itself crystallizes a critical tradition that stretches back at least as far as Montague Summers’s reading of Matthew Lewis in The Gothic Quest (1938) and that inflects every sustained discussion of homosexuality and the Gothic (at least the male Gothic) of the past three decades.” (272)
Thus George Haggerty: “The connections between the history of sexuality (and the growth of sexology) and the gothic are not necessarily coincidental. They haunt each other with similarities” (Queer 51). Or Paulina Palmer: “The association of the vampire with the period of twilight, since the sunset is supposed to liberate her from her coin and permit her to venture abroad to stalk her prey, is per- tinent in metaphoric terms to the closeted lesbian who, having concealed her sexual orientation during the day, emerges at night to seek romance in the half-lit world of clubs and bars” (102). Or me: “After ifteen years of teaching Gothic literature and queer theory, I have come to regard the phrase ‘Gothic sexualities’ as self-evident, even somewhat redundant”” (272)
“True Blood is recycling a centuries-old afiliation between the Gothic and the gay; it can only use parodic humor, rather than the heuristics of urgent discovery, to talk about the Gothic and homophobia.” … “overall the series built on the rhetoric of gay liberation focuses on heterosexual plots and conventionally straight love triangles in a way that deploys the language of gayness to render gayness irrelevant.” (273) 
“if homosex is not a central thematic or a representational topos for a twentyirst-century television show, it is even less a representational topos for the eighteenthand nineteenth-century Gothic novel” “A genre that is notorious for its presentation of verboten sex acts – voyeurism, rape, incest, sexual torture and bondage, adultery, cuckoldry, “illegitimate” pregnancy – the classic British Gothic, to the best of my knowledge, presents no scenes of male-male sodomy” (273) 
“This, to my mind, is a remarkable lacuna, one that cannot be explained with references to literary history or censorship practices. We had seen male-male sex acts earlier in the century, in John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (1748) and Tobias Smollett’s Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751), and eighteenth-century French pornography did not stint on the spectacle of male homosexual sex – Sade is enough to cite here (see Hanson, Tuite, and Stoddart) – but no British homophobic Gothic depicts its homophobia with the object lesson of the homosexual. No version of the disgust expressed by Fanny Hill or Peregrine Pickle over the spectacle of the sodomite inds its Gothic equivalent in a genre willing to depict for us the pulverized mass of a Mother Superior’s corpse (see Matthew Lewis’s The Monk) or the teeth marks that lacerate a dead couple’s body as, incarcerated and starved, they turn cannibal to prolong their miserable lives (see Robert Maturin’s Melmoth the Wanderer). The Gothic novel, at least prior to the Stonewall Resistance Riot of 1969, and at least in its male characters, is profoundly reticent about the spectacle of direct homophobia, as reticent as it is about the spectacle of homosexuality. How might we understand this?” (274)
“The role of metonym as the predominant trope in Gothic representations of homophobia is critically important because, if metonym constitutes the homosexual-homophobic relation in the Gothic, it displaces it at the same time.” (275)
“something might be gained in disentangling the homosexual from the paranoid, the metaphor from the metonym, the notorious from the ify, and to ask again what interventions the Gothic might make in the spectacle of normative sexual relations.” (276)
“If the classic Gothic could occlude the site of male-male sex, whose presence is detectable only through the rhetorical double-speak of metonymy, the Gothic makes women’s same-sex pleasure too legible” (277)
THE MONK
“Tuite argues that it presents, explodes, and then retroactively reconstitutes a homoerotic relationship that is “specifically pedagogical and pederastic” (278) “The heterosexual excess that ensues is, for Tuite, made possible by the homoerotic energies established before the unveiling, and retroactively makes of that male bond a sexualized, if unacted on, energy” (278)
“Tuite’s argument that heterosexuality relegates the homosexual to the closet – thus to fears of blackmailability – actually displaces the fear from the site at which it exists: in heterosexual relations. “Ambrosio is in danger – of discovery, of disgrace, of immortal perdition – only by virtue of Matilda’s presence as a woman in the monastery.” (278)
“Miles convincingly notes how biographical concerns have shaped criticism of The Monk so that the “open secret” of Lewis’s homosexuality compels us to read the novel within the personal and political landscape of sodomy in 1790s Britain.” (279)
“In this reading, Gothic novels are less novels than they are creative autobiographies – and we might pause to wonder whether a subject wishing to confess to a desire that might see him hanged on the morrow would turn to the mode of the Gothic” (280)

CARMILLA
“For every part vampire, Carmilla is also part damsel in distress, and for every part distressed damsel, Carmilla is also, for feminist and antihomophobic readers, an agent of sexual liberation.” (281)
“In my reading of The Monk and its critics, lines of desirous light coalesce into a centralizing identity of a Homosexual Author writing his experiences as code within and against a homophobic culture. Antihomophobic critics have read these lines of light as metonyms-begetting-metaphors, and thus of identity writ large. Something similar happens in “Carmilla,” only in reverse.” (282)
“Like Veeder, who argues that the text’s lesbianism is a mere occasion for Victorianism’s larger concerns regarding repression tout court (198), for Stoddart the lesbian makes most sense when she is about something else, about historical, colonial, masculinist pursuits. In these readings, lesbian pleasure in ‘Carmilla’ exists to take us away from lesbian pleasure in ‘Carmilla’” (282)
“Of course, both critics know that the vampire does reproduce – she makes other vampires – but in Stoddart’s estimation, there is nothing life-giving or airmative about such birthing: the story’s lesbianism is “female sexuality, not turned toward itself but turning on itself, and the result is not desire for love but cruelty, possession, contagion, and, potentially, death” (32).6” (283)
“Before we see such textual and social homophobia as an attack on our dignity, we might also wonder whether to prefer “sterility” if sterility’s opposite – compulsory reproduction – might itself be something that queers want to resist.” (283) — Turn to Lee Edelman
“Queer not just for their crossdressing or their lesbian desire, Matilda and Carmilla infect and destroy with the teasing allure of sexuality lived otherwise.” (285)

Conclusion: “It has been my contention in this chapter that the search and rescue mission of detecting gays and lesbians as victims of homophobia in the Gothic has left us trapped in a hermeneutic circle that can only assuredly provide us with what we have been looking for: evidence of phobic persecution. I am suggesting instead that the Gothic propensity to shatter bodies and souls be read alongside the queer propensity to shatter egos and identities that have been sexualized as gay or straight by a culture that fetishizes such identity. In this reading, the “homo” under duress may be less the persecuted or abjected sexual pervert than it is the determined, the stable, the legible self of Western modernity.” (285)

Footnote: “Here I part from Miles, who reads heterosexual incest in Lewis as “a cipher for a yet more heinous – within the codes of polite writing, a literally unspeakable – desire” (52), the desire for same-sex pleasure. The eighteenth-century novel has spoken this desire at length, and the Gothic novel hardly qualiies as “polite writing.”” (285)

            <Text>Bill Readings
“Guillory seems almost to have rephrased Harold Bloom’s account of the anxiety of influence in sociological terms: literary culture emerges as always already anxious about its own waning influence, torn between a general claim about culture and a need to restrict that culture in order to preserve or restore its purity, to establish its distinctiveness and assure its status as cultural capital.” (Readings 322)
“As Balibar and others have insisted, the canon is a false problem, if we only ask what it contains and neglect the social forms of distribution that it implies. We need to look at the syllabus, the curriculum, and the educational system,refusing of the pretensions of the canon either to represent a culture or to present an inclusive account of cultures.” (Readings 322)
“Guillory argues that political economy and aesthetics emerge as parallel discourses structured by their mutual forgetting of the other’s notion of value and by the struggle to distinguish the work of art from the commodity (317)” (Readings 322)
“Guillory pointedly criticizes Smith for not having paid sufficient attention to Kant: she conflates aesthetics with aesthetic value and, like the Marxist critic Tony Bennet, takes value to be a property of the object rather than, as Kant argues, a matter of subjectivejudgment (276)” (Readings 322)
“The issue here is not Guillory’sscholarship but whether his theoretical framework can successfully address the literary curriculum.” (Readings 323)
“Chapter 1 calls for an analysis of the “systematicconstitution and distribution of cultural capital” as part of a “project of political integration” (82).Chapters z and 3 perform such analyses,yet do not reveal how an understanding of literature as cultural capital will lead to a reconception of the literary curriculum, let alone to political integration. In this sense they seem curiously parasitical on the system they expose and denounce. Chapter 4, on the canonization of literary theory, ends by demanding a reconceptualization of the object of literary study without suggesting what direction this might take (265). Likewise, after attacking institutional pedagogy, denouncing charismatic teaching and the role of affect, and finding in de Man and Lacan’s demands for rigor “the desire that the disciplesform a church” ( 2 0 2 ) ,Guillory offers no account of an alternative pedagogy.” (Readings 324)
“Guillory falls into the same trap he detects in Leavis: adversarial culture is devoted to its own effacement, since success means failure (loss of adversarial status)” (Readings 324)
“Every critique of the system is shown to be a move within the system … An other to the system is unthinkable. Hence, what is proposed is not an alternative but the more equal redistribution of capital within the system, which Guillory thematizes as increased “access”to cultural goods.” (Readings 324)
“After several hundred dense pages these closing words make a rather particular claim for the redemptive power of the aesthetic. They suggest that we are not yet ready for Kant, that only after Marx has done his work and the means of production and consumption have been socialized can we really be Kantians, harmlessly engaging in the freeplay of aesthetic judgment.” (Readings 325)
“The apparent plea for the relative autonomy of the aesthetic turns out to be a strong privileging of the economic base: only when social inequality has been set aside does aestheticjudgment become free. Aestheticism is thus unbound because the differences it makes will no longer be real, dire differences.” (Readings 325)
“Only when analyses are entirely restricted within national frontiers can cultural capital seem fungible. Translatability is not a given: instead of describing cultural capital as the currency of a national totality, one has to ask “prestigefor whom?”Since culture is no longer one game but many heterogeneous games, there is no ready-made answer.” (Readings 326)
“From this perspective, the underside of Guillory’s rephrasing of the canon debate in terms of the distribution of cultural capital appears. Does not the appeal to cultural capital finally mask the desire to preserve the nation state as the fundamental unit of cultural analysis, in a world in which global fusion (Wallerstein’s “geo-culture”) and national fission threaten its status? Is the nation-state-withering in the face of the Trans-National corporation-perhaps no longer the primary instance of the reproduction of capital?” (Readings 326)

            <Text>Charlotte Smith is selected as a writer who was productive in multiple genres, only some of which may end up represented in corpora. Charlotte Smith’s literary career began with the publication of her volume of poetry Elegiac Sonnets, in 1784. This work is the one upon which much of Smith’s fame and prestige rested in the eighteenth century. A second edition of Elegiac Sonnets rapidly followed the first in the same year, with only slight amendments. The third and fourth editions of Elegiac Sonnets appeared in 1786, adding new poems. 1786 also saw the publication of Smith’s The Romance of Real Life, a translation of Les Causes Célèbres, her first foray into prose, which would occupy the major part of the next phase of her career. In 1788 she published her first original novel, Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle. 1789 begins this dissertation’s decade of interest, a period of intense productivity for Smith: she had at least one new publication almost every year from 1789-1799. In 1789, she published her second original novel, Ethelinde, or the Recluse of the Lake, and a fifth edition of Elegiac Sonnets. In 1791 she published Celestina, her third novel; in 1792, her fourth novel, Desmond, and a sixth edition of Elegiac Sonnets. Although Elegiac Sonnets continued to be reprinted, reaching its tenth edition in 1812, after this edition no further poems were added. Instead, her new poetry appeared in their own independent publications, and no longer took the form of sonnets. In 1793 she published The Emigrants, a poem in two volumes, as well as The Old Manor House, her fifth novel. In 1794, her sixth and seventh novels, The Wanderings of Warwick and The Banished Man. In 1795 she published her eighth novel, Montalbert, and began writing in a new genre with Rural Walks. With Rural Walks, Smith’s dominant genre again changed: having gone from a poet to a novelist, she now primarily published in a form which does not have a contemporary name: morally instructive natural history for “young persons.” 1796 saw the sequel to Rural Walks, Rambles Farther, as well as the novel Marchmont, and the poem A Narrative of the loss… of several ships. 1797 saw the eighth edition of Elegiac Sonnets, unchanged since the sixth. 1798 saw the novel The Young Philosopher, and more natural history for children in Minor Morals. In 1799, Smith tried her hand at theatre with What Is She?, a comedy — not a form she will revisit. After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Smith continued to write at a slightly less frenetic pace. In 1800 she published the first three volumes of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer, an epistolary anthology of narratives. In 1802 she published two additional volumes of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer. In 1804, she published Conversations, Introducing Poetry, for children. In 1806, Smith published History of England, another work for young persons, and Smith herself died, age 55. The next year saw the posthumous publication of the poem Beachy Head and the work for young persons, The Natural History of Birds.</Text>

            <Title>it's the author</Title>
            <Text>The underrepresentation of unsigned authors cannot be mapped onto the multicultural rhetoric of political representation, the way Guillory has described with gendered representation. “Unsigned” or “pseudonymous” people are not an identity category in the real world requiring equitable social standing: the unsigned and pseudonymous authors, if identified, would all turn out to have names, genders, races, class standings, and all the other traits of humans in the world. What their status as “unsigned” in the database really means is not that those traits are absent — it means that those traits are undetermined at the site of the title page.

Scholars have worked to infrastructurally eliminate the “unsigned” author. “Real” names are placed into the relevant database fields wherever possible, even in cases where this substitution contains little real information. One work, titled “Observations on the origin and effects of the Test Act” and printed in 1790, has its author listed in the ESTC as “Hudson, active 1790.” A note suggests that this attribution is somewhat shaky: “Attribution from Halkett &amp; Laing which seems to be based on a MS attribution on O copy titlepage, no longer legible. O copy with MS date May 18. 1790. Verify number and position of advertisement leaves.” This is the only item in the ESTC attributed to “Hudson, 1790” so identifying “Hudson” in this way does not provide value by linking the work to another. In contrast, the title page attribution identifies the author as “a dissenter.” This, I contend, is a more useful identification of the author.</Text>

            <Text>Introduction:

“This study will examine both the spectacle and the forces that shaped it. Examples of performance, drama and theatrical innovation will illustrate how public entertainment responded to the turbulence in the intellectual climate that sociopolitical changes induced, for, even though London did not suffer the traumas of Paris, it underwent a major cultural crisis.” (1)

p.2: When artists can no longer represent the world in coherent patterns, the recognition of which engenders in the viewer a sense of identification and reassurance with the familiar, they may resort to the use of metaphor. They may rework experience into weird and intriguing patterns that distance the audience from reality -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018

Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery, all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all ± mainpieces, comic or tragic; afterpieces, satirical, farcical, musical or spectacular; interludes of music, song and dance; the wit of prologue and epilogue and above all the attractions of the performers, all received plaudits from all corners of the house. Critics might make sharp comparisons, but little of the programme was dismissed as `trash', or `immoral', or irrelevant `fancy'. (3)
p.3: Disagreement as to what is trash and what is treasure suggests cultural crisis, when values are put under question by social stress or political conflict. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.4: those on the `lower' margins of society had not yet found a distinctive voice; their discontent found safe and symbolic expression in rowdy games and festive sports -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.5: in the 1790s individual voices became shriller and their ideas more persuasive to a different section of the population, thus contributing to social fragmentation and creating what today we call `identity politics'. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.6: Politicians, philosophers and economists may have to hammer out rational interpretations of the seeming chaos of material reality, but for artists, and, more particularly, for their bewildered audiences, the naturalistic depiction of probability can seem inadequate. Only an evocation of the barely possible provides a satisfying response to the contradictions of a world which `self-evident' principles can no longer explain.

p.6: When analysing the statistics gathered for his invaluable work, Theatre, Opera, and Audiences in Revolutionary Paris, Emmet Kennedy argues that previous historians overstated the political content and in ̄uence of the theatre during the Revolution.U -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.6: although `uncommitted' plays far outnumbered those dealing with speci®cally political issues, his analyses of changes in emphasis and attitude show that the impact of events on theatrical taste was crucial ± though indirect. Historians can fall into the same trap as political censors in trying to identify topics, stories and speeches that speci®cally refer to issues of the day, because the relationship is usually more subtle than speci®c precisely because it is unintentional. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
For instance, Pierre Desforges' Le Sourd, ou L'Auberge Pleine was the most popular French play of the period (1789±99), a comedy in which a man pretends to be deaf in order to gain accommodation in a crowded inn. Kennedy accurately summarises the plot and its (p. 7) reliance on conventional tropes and situations: `Stock eighteenth- century themes are skilfully exploited here: marriage of love over marriage of interest, bourgeois frugality and prudence over aristo- cratic honour, testy master-servant relations in which money is the main factor, and the psychology of deaf-mutes . . . It has no political message, only a few social banalities.'V At ®rst glance it does seem very traditional, and, no doubt, contemporary audiences read little into it. But all these `stock themes' have implications in identifying the political sympathies of the audience, and some of the new situations or jokes had a more than stock resonance in the context of its ®rst performance in 1790 ± the legitimate travellers' room and the host's chair at table are `usurped' by an outsider pretending to be deaf. Did the revolutionaries of 1790 seem `deaf to reality'? Or just the provincial ones travelling to Paris? If their policies were a trick, should we admire their cunning or their effrontery? The play posed no such political questions directly of its audience, but its very popularity raises them for the cultural analysts. My own curiosity is raised particularly by the metaphor of deafness being adopted as a strategy for coping with a material problem ± particularly as the number of dramatic characters who are deaf, mute or blind steadily increased during the period under investigation. 

p.8: My own method is fundamentally rooted in principles of historical materialism, which continually raise the question of in whose interest events take place, and look for the ways in which material conditions in ̄uence ideological explanations. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.8: When discussing theatrical production my focus will not always be on the most influential aspects of political or social change, but on how the apparently trivial minutiae of the entertainment business reflected ideological attitudes that were being determined elsewhere on the wide stage of the world. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.9: However, whilst attracted by the oblique perspective of New Historicism, I will continually look to the ultimate shift in material power between social classes to explain the twists and turns of apparent contingency. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.11: My study, of course, intends to explore the very speci®c cultural force of theatre production and how it was involved in `carrying through the transformation'.  -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.14: As shall be seen, throughout this period of cultural crisis, the popular theatre embodied and reflected in many forms not only the material concerns but also many of the wider, less tangible, anxieties of its audiences. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018

Ch 1: lots of references to what is and is not “popular”, with no indication of how he determined them
Notes don’t include any real details on how popularity is determined

Conclusion
p.221: I have, however, argued in some detail that the determining feature of the period for the theatre was the sense of loss, a feeling that things had changed in ways that people did not expect or want, and that theatrical formulations reflected this in images of incarceration, dislocation and supernatural intervention. Plays looked backwards to the past in order to make sense of the present and future. That past provided contradictory settings ± cruel fortresses of feudal power and innocent family homes in rural villages. Homes and security that were continually threatened, but, in dreamlike happy (222) endings, were saved by heroic acts of restoration. But in real life, conflict and change were not resolved so neatly. If traditional powers were restored they were reconstructed in the process, and, when the reconstructions were as thorough as Napoleon's reinvention of autocracy, the factory owner's dispossession of the peripatetic clothier, or Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian reformulation of Enlightenment benevolence, then the oppression seemed worse as it had become more efficient. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.224: These details of theatre administration and financial policy confirm my conviction that capitalism or, as it was then termed, political economy was the one ideology to emerge more confident than before from the intellectual turmoil engendered by the Revolution. What Adam Smith called the `invisible hand' of economic competition was becoming visible. Classical economists and their political equivalents, the Benthamite Utilitarians, began to claim that the market was the only realistic force that could bene®t good, and drive out bad, practice ± not only in commerce, but in all organisations, civic, cultural and even charitable. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.225: The signi®cance of relating these ®nal years is that Godwin encouraged the young Hazlitt to complete Holcroft's un®nished autobiography.W Although Hazlitt probably considered the task a piece of hack work, the book's existence indicates a direct link between pre-Revolutionary radicalism, as professed by Holcroft, and the post-1815 radicalism associated with a new generation of rationalists that included not only Hazlitt but Francis Place and Robert Owen. Holcroft, a self-educated man, never let persecution or disappointment in the course of events undermine his belief that simple honesty could ®nd rational solutions to political problems. In that he was probably the most consistent of those who greeted the dawn of 1789. For many of the so-called Romantics the Terror of 1793, the emergence of Napoleon's personal dictatorship and cultural triumph of bourgeois vulgarity led them to adopt a state of social isolation and intellectual denial. The new radicalism of the 1820s replaced both Holcroft's simple faith in the benevolence of man and the Romantic obsession with individual identity with a new critique of property. Owen called it Socialism. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018</Text>

            <Title>why titles count</Title>
            <Text>In designing this tool, I want to take advantage of one of the unique features of eighteenth century literature: long and descriptive titles. In most periods of literary history, the information that gets input in the “title” field of a database offers a scholar very little to work with. Eighteenth century books were advertised and sold without any visual cues as to their contents; they attracted readers through the strength of their title pages alone. Bibliographers have consistently chosen to record a large amount of this title page information. Their lengthy titles therefore intentionally communicate their genres, and, as my paper demonstrates, their messages can be distilled through topic modelling. I present my results for the 52,000 titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799, and discuss the resulting ontology of generic categories. As I demonstrate, inferring genres based on how texts describe themselves produces a very different picture of the categories of textual production than the post-facto descriptions that later generations of scholars have produced. I am then able to use these subject categories to compare the contents of several commonly-used digital resources, to identify how representative of eighteenth century literature as a whole each database is. Finally, I discuss how my methods might be adapted to address similar gaps in metadata in related fields.</Text>

            <Title>ch 3 - lingering legacies</Title>
            <Text>Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? As in my first chapter, the “case study” texts for this chapter will emerge from my broader research. I am particularly eager to investigate timely re-stagings of plays, given the heightened ephemerality and thus timeliness of theatrical productions compared to print; my first step is to assemble a precise timeline of what was staged during the period. For printed works, some initial exploration suggests that Shakespeare, Oliver Goldsmith, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Johnson, or Milton might be of interest. I will need to determine what distinction, if any, I might want to draw between “canonical” authors like Shakespeare and Milton, whose posthumous prominence is predictable, and any shorter-lived targeted reprintings that I might discover. This chapter, then, is another way of engaging with the idea of “legacy,” exploring the distinctions between “timelessness” and “lasting timeliness.”</Text>

            <Text>A central tension for me is the sense that Hannah More and William Wordsworth are both falling into similar traps of aestheticizing and moralizing their disdain for the very real distress for those in poverty, and that I nonetheless find Shepherd of Salisbury Plain more palatable than Michael. Michael in its beauties disguises its operations; More is so transparent that it’s easy to simply set aside what is unpalatable and read for the other details.

“In 1990, there were 250,000 internet users, and the standard was 360 K disks. In January 1991, Michael typed in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll (published in 1865). In July 1991, he typed in Peter Pan, by James M. Barrie (published in 1904).” (Lebert)
“By the time Project Gutenberg got famous, the standard was 360K disks, so we did books such as Alice in Wonderland or Peter Pan because they could fit on one disk. Now 1.44 is the standard disk and ZIP is the standard compression; the practical filesize is about three million characters, more than long enough for the average book.” (Hart “History and Philosophy”)
“Project Gutenberg gradually got into its stride, with the digitization of one book per month in 1991, two books per month in 1992, four books per month in 1993 and eight books per month in 1994. In January 1994, Project Gutenberg celebrated its 100th book by releasing The Complete Works of William Shakespeare.” (Lebert)
1994, Italian volunteer Pietro Di Miceli developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. (“Credits”)</Text>

            <Title>HathiTrust</Title>
            <Text>The first step was to make a “collection” in the HathiTrust system.
To search the catalog based on metadata is the best way to find what I want, but to add works found in that way, I would have needed to open each individual file. The catalog search returned 4,026 items.
So instead I did a “full-text search” for a bogus search term but with my date range, added a restriction to England, and removed the search term. This method returned 8,220 full-text results, which I could add to my collection 100 at a time. I confirmed that I’d gotten them all by checking that the final collection also had 8,220 items.
HathiTrust also suggests contacting them to make custom collections — which I will do, in part to see if it has a different result that the one I made manually.

I then downloaded the metadata for this collection as “Tab-Delimited Text (TSV)”
To count how many titles are included per year, I opened in OpenRefine and filtered “date” by each year in sequence, to see how many results were returned

            <Title>proposal</Title>
            <Text>Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2nd or 10th edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.
Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.</Comments>

Throughout this work, a ‘title’ is the broadest possible umbrella term for a text: it is synonymous with ‘a database entry which I believe to represent a printed work.’ Each individual database will shape the precise correspondences between a ‘title’ and the printed texts about which I use ‘titles’ to reason. For example, it will vary based on my source whether multiple editions of the same work are several ‘titles’ or one ‘title,’ and whether the titles exclusively represent ‘books’ or also include chapbooks, broadsheets, or even ephemera.

History of the Book Database:
How Four Repositories of Eighteenth-Century Works Select for Gender
Lawrence Evalyn

Despite the impression they give of always being ‘up to date’, digital resources often reflect much earlier conceptions of the imagined whole of literature. It has now been more than thirty years since feminist criticism started having major successes in eighteenth century studies. No eighteenth centuryist is now likely to say that Charlotte Smith, for example, is irrelevant or unimportant to the period, a stance supported by her substantial presence in traditional scholarly infrastructures. Smith is given prominent space in all anthologies of Romantic literature; she regularly appears on introductory syllabi, including surveys of all British literature; there are scholarly editions, and seminars, and dissertations, and conference panels, and every other sign that she is an important and valued writer. But what about digital infrastructures? Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), for example, began in 2003, well after figures like Charlotte Smith had been ‘recovered.’ But the microfilms underlying ECCO date from the 1980s: so ECCO might easily reflect 1980s priorities about what kinds of works are worth investing in and redistributing. To what extent do research infrastructures, especially digital ones, ‘lag behind’ scholarly consensus? And beyond just one author, to what extent do historically uneven practices of digitization shape scholarly access to eighteenth century texts at scale?
Scholarly concerns regarding what is lost in a shift to digital books often focus on physical features of the books themselves, both subtle qualitative features (such as the texture of the paper) and quite important traits which would be obvious in person (such as the relative size of a duodecimo versus a folio). Another form of absence, however, is the book which has not been digitized. It seems obvious that there must be systemic absences, but the precise scope and nature of those absences are difficult to define: to identify what is missing from an incomplete list, one must have the ‘complete’ list elsewhere to make a comparison. A recent experiment by Allen Riddell and Troy J. Bassett, for example, uses exhaustive bibliographies of new British novels in 1836 and 1838, to determine what percentage of these works today have digital editions available. They find that novels by women, and single-volume novels, are substantially less likely to have been digitized than multi-volume novels by men in these two years. Narrowing their focus by genre, year, and geographic region makes it possible to have a reasonably complete initial list. They conclude cautiously that “it seems prudent for researchers to assume that gathering samples of fiction or non-fiction works published in the British Isles during the 1830s and 1840s from the major digital libraries will yield samples which do not reflect the population.” It is by combining multiple partial experiments of this kind that we will eventually be able to describe, and appropriately respond to, uneven digitization on a larger scale. Unexpectedly, I have not found the same bias against the digitization of women’s writing for works published in England between 1789-99 — though I do not therefore conclude that digital archives do accurately reflect the original population of published works. Riddell and Bassett search Internet Archive, HathiTrust, Google Books, and the British Library, and consider a novel to be “available digitally” if it is present in any one of these repositories, but these resources are not interchangeable. I contend that it is also crucial to distinguish between which digital archives contain different works. Doing so highlights the fact that any database is shaped by the material conditions of its creation, and that uneven digitization is not as straightforward as a simple gender bias.
To more fully map the terrain of uneven digitization in eighteenth century studies, I begin with the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) as the largest and most comprehensive set of records: for works printed in England 1789-99, they list 51,090 titles. Eighteenth Century Collections Online, for the same period, has facsimiles of 26,848 works— barely more than half the titles listed in the ESTC. HathiTrust, a different collection of facsimiles, has 8,220 works. The smallest and most specialized academic text repository, the Text Creation Partnership (TCP) collection of meticulously hand-encoded transcriptions, contains only 525 works from the 1790s: an almost negligible 1% of the ESTC. The TCP thus contains an almost negligible 1% of the titles listed in the ESTC. The shrinking size of each resource is a natural result of the different level of investment required to add a work to each. The ESTC might be assumed to be the least influenced by selection bias, since it includes the least information about each work and has the largest commitment to comprehensiveness. Correspondingly, the TCP is likely the most influenced by selection bias, with the highest per-book cost and the fewest claims to represent a complete whole. Comparing the two raises the question: which kinds of works were selected to receive that scholarly investment? If scholars now adopt TCP texts for computational distant-reading, how distorted is their sample compared to the original population of works published in the eighteenth century? Looking beyond what might seem merely technological or methodological: what do the resources we have created reveal about the discipline itself? In posing these questions, rather than questions that might be more directly literary, I bring the emerging field of digital infrastructure studies to the eighteenth century to undertake a history of the book database.
Charlotte Smith in the Digital Archive
To better understand the current state of eighteenth-century works in digital databases, it is helpful to follow a single figure and the specific reasons that their individual works have been included or excluded over the years, beginning with the pre-digital creation and social valuation of those works. Charlotte Smith is now famous in multiple areas of eighteenth-century literature: as an early Romantic poet, for her genre-bending Elegiac Sonnets which influenced Wordsworth and for her longer works The Emigrants and Beachy Head; as a Gothic and political novelist, for works like The Old Manor House and the radical Desmond; and as a pioneer in children’s educational literature, for her natural history. During her lifetime, she achieved critical success as a poet, and some commercial success as a novelist (though her radical politics increasingly jeopardized her ability to sell novels later in her career). Smith’s posthumous critical reception has undergone multiple shifts in appreciation and obscurity. Shortly after her death in 1806, Smith was widely eulogized and anthologized, remembered and emulated as an important British poet. As the nineteenth century went on, poetesses began to be anthologized separately from poets, in collections with ambitions that were commercial rather than intellectual; Smith, too, “lost intellectual ground” even as she continued to be sold. By the end of the nineteenth century, even these volumes marginalized Smith’s poetry, with prefatory material which dismissed them as trite and depressing, unenjoyable reading. In the early twentieth century, Smith began to be considered as a novelist, rather than a poet; this new field did not lead at first to a much better reputation for her. Florence Hilbish produced the first extensive study of Smith, considering her as both poet and novelist, in 1941, to unappreciative reviews: Ernest Bernbaum’s faint praise said that “much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable,” since “the subtle or intricate is absent from Charlotte Smith's writings.”
Duckling credits the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s with the beginning of Smith’s recovery: the renewed interest in women’s writing rediscovered her novels, and especially the radical political content which Hilbish had observed. At the same time, Bishop Hunt published a record of Smith’s influence on Wordsworth, as demonstrated by an almost overwhelming amount of physical evidence: Wordsworth owned copies of her works, which he annotated; he copied out some of her sonnets in his own hand; he paid her a personal visit; he edited some of her poetry for publication; he wrote explicitly of her influence in notes to his works. Hunt calls Smith “an important early influence on Wordsworth which has not been explored in any detail up to now;” his abstract somewhat snarkily asserts that “Wordsworth did not suddenly start writing sonnets in 1802 simply because he happened to read Milton’s.” However, Hunt has little praise for Smith herself: of one poem, he says, “Whatever the artistic value of such verses,” what matters is the underlying theme which Wordsworth would later express more masterfully. Smith continued to be treated separately as an interesting woman novelist, and a minor pre-Romantic poet, through the 1980s. Smith rose to greater prominence in both of these fields in the 1990s: with work by Stephen Curran, Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, Andrew Ashfield, and Jacqueline Labbe, “Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism.” How has this varying reception history impacted Smith’s presence in contemporary databases? Our baseline list of “all works published by Smith,” against which we can compare each resource to locate its absences, includes 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death, as shown in Table 1 below.

None of the four databases I consider (ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, or TCP) includes all 47 of these works. The most interesting exclusions occur at the beginning and the end of Smith’s publishing career. The first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), for example, is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere. The publications in the last years of her life, occurring after 1800, are excluded from the chronological focus of most resources but can still appear in HathiTrust. Of particular interest is the fact that Beachy Head (1807), which is now one of Smith’s most frequently anthologized and taught poems, does not appear in a single digital database. None of these inclusions or exclusions represent an agenda against (or for) Smith, or indeed an interpretive choice at all, but they nonetheless shape the disciplinary infrastructure. Figure 1 shows smaller and smaller databases winnowing down her full output arbitrarily:
￼
Figure 1: An alluvial chart, showing the winnowing down of Smith’s works from database to database. Of the 47 editions printed in England between 1784 and 1807, 42 are included in the ESTC, and 5 do not appear in the ESTC because they were printed after 1800. ECCO contains 37 of Smith’s 47 editions, all of which also appear in the ESTC. ECCO is missing the 5 editions not listed in the ESTC (since it, too, does not contain works past 1800), as well as another 5 works. HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith’s 47 editions, but unlike ECCO, these are not a simple subset of the ESTC. HathiTrust contains one of the 5 editions excluded from the ESTC, and one of the 5 editions included in ESTC but excluded from ECCO. The remaining 16 HathiTrust editions appear in both the ESTC and ECCO. ECCO-TCP includes only 2 of Smith’s 47 editions, both of which appear in every previous database.
What, then, is not selected for preservation? For both ESTC and ECCO, the answer begins with a selection criteria at the site of collection: neither includes any works published in or after 1800. The ESTC, therefore, excludes volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802), three works for children (Conversations, Introducing Poetry, 1804; History of England, 1806; and Natural History of Birds, 1807), and the posthumous publication that now forms a major part of Smith’s reputation as a poet, Beachy Head (1807). ECCO lacks these five editions for the same reason, and then adds a selection bias at the site of digitization. Five works which fall within ECCO’s collection mandate are nonetheless excluded: the first and ninth editions of Elegiac Sonnets (1784 and 1800), the second edition of The Banished Man (1795), the first edition of Minor Morals (1798), and the second edition of Rambles Farther (1800). Presumably, these volumes were too scarce, too inaccessible, or too fragile to be imaged by Research Publications, Inc when they undertook to produce the Eighteenth Century Collection microfilm in 1983.
HathiTrust’s images come not from 1980s microfilms, but from Google Books scans undertaken from 2004 to today. This scanning was undertaken without reference to another bibliography, or any selection criteria over than availability: Google has periodically announced an intention to scan every book in the world. In order to induce university libraries to allow Google to borrow books by the semi truck, Google provided universities with their own copies of any scanned produced from that library’s collection; HathiTrust brings together those libraries’ copies into an academic resource. Although the same jpegs are involved in both Google Books and HathiTrust, therefore, they remain separate institutions, with Google Books still decidedly corporate while HathiTrust is a non-profit academic institution. HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith’s 47 editions, though these are not a simple subset of the ESTC and ECCO. Unlike the ESTC and ECCO, HathiTrust contains volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802). This is the only post-1800 work which appears in HathiTrust, however— the others are also missing, including the important volume Beachy Head (1807). There is one work included in HathiTrust but not in ECCO, the second edition of The Banished Man (1795). Whereas ECCO does not include works unless there is a complete copy available, HathiTrust provides scans of volumes 2, 3, and 4, and simply implies through their numbering that there is a missing first volume — perhaps in the optimism that a volume 1 will appear from another library’s holdings, to complete the set later. The remaining HathiTrust included titles appear in both the ESTC and ECCO, and a further 21 titles appear as facsimiles in ECCO but not in HathiTrust. At first blush it is somewhat surprising that HathiTrust has failed to include works which are, demonstrably, in known locations at institutional libraries, and in physically sound condition to be scanned— but in other ways, too, the scans making up HathiTrust bear no relation to the scans in ECCO. The Young Philosopher (1798), for example, appears in ECCO sourced from a British Library copy, but the HathiTrust images are from the New York Public Library. Google’s rapacious book-scanning, unsurprisingly, was not as thorough as ECCO’s sustained scholarly project.
The smallest subset of all of these texts is the ECCO-TCP holding of just two titles: the second edition of Celestina (1791), and the first edition of The Emigrants (1793). Both titles appear in all larger databases, including HathiTrust. Looking more closely at these two works, as the only works by Charlotte Smith which are available in all four databases, illuminates how none of the four truly offer access to the “same” work. First, of course, there is the obvious detail that they provide fundamentally different information. ESTC gives bibliographic records and library shelf-marks, deferring ‘outward’ to a ‘real’ physical book. The other three choose a specific copy to represent this ‘real’ book, and provide a mediated reformulation of that copy. ECCO provides monochrome images of microfilm scans; HathiTrust, full-colour digital photographs of book pages. The TCP offers meticulously hand-encoded transcripts. The bibliographic metadata for these works is the same between ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records. In HathiTrust, however, the source text for The Emigrants is a University of California Library copy (rather than the British Library copy used by the others), which has been scanned by Google Books and is presented with substantially less detailed bibliographic information. The ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records for The Emigrants all provide the same physical description “ix, 3, 68 i.e. 60p. ; 4⁰” with the same note “numbers 9-16 omitted in pagination; text is continuous.” HathiTrust, in contrast, gives the physical description “ix, 68 p. ; 26 cm,” which is both more and less information. A quarto volume could be a range of sizes, so HathiTrust provides new detail by giving a measurement in centimetres. However, the data on page numbers is now misleading, as HathiTrust omits the detail about the volume’s inaccurate pagination. It becomes clear that HathiTrust, borne as it is from Google’s corporate priorities, has lost effort on reinventing the wheel: even as HathiTrust fills some gaps in existing scholarly resources, it does so at the expense of having to start from scratch, creating new gaps where previous work makes them needless.
In the end, the lacunae of the digital resources have led to Smith’s presence being smaller than might be expected — even in resources created more recently, after her ‘recovery’ might have encouraged more investment in the preservation and recirculation of her works. However, Smith’s absences are not easily attributed to systemic sexism, or even to a bias against ‘unserious’ genres which can often function as a veiled sexism. Instead, the missing works tell us much more about the databases that lack them than they tell us about scholarly embrace of Smith herself. Examining the history of those databases in greater detail, we can see [WHATEVER MY ARGUMENT IS ABOUT THE DATABASE HISTORIES SECTION AFTER I MAKE IT LESS BORING.]
Databases of Eighteenth Century Literature, 1977-2020
These four databases — ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and TCP — are only part of the larger ecosystem of digital book repositories. These databases require substantial description, preliminary to analysis, since they have conventionally been treated as tools for accessing objects of study, rather than objects of study in themselves. Here, I will give a brief overview of how these resources relate to each other, and then a detailed chronological history of their development from the 1970s to the present. Discussing the nitty-gritty specifics of digitization — including Google Books’ lawsuit and the corporate restructures of Thomson Gale, The Thomson Corporation, The Gale Group, Gale Cengage Learning, and so on — recontextualizes these resources as historical artifacts. Figure 2 shows a Venn diagram of the approximate relative scale, and overlap in holdings, of eight databases in three ecosystems relevant to this history. In blue is the purely academic ecosystem: the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and the ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP). In pink is the commercial Google-backed ecosystem: Google Books, Google Ngrams, and HathiTrust. Project Gutenberg is also included for comparison, to indicate the presence of a third ecosystem of textual collection, not-for-profit but also not-for-academics; its complex case is beyond the scope of this article, but offers an important consideration for future work.
	￼
Figure 2: A hand-drawn Venn diagram of the general relative scale and overlapping holdings of databases containing 1790s literature. The orientation and colour-coding of the ovals groups them into three ecosystems: the academic databases in blue pointing left, the commercial databases in pink pointing right, and the crowdsourced database in green oriented horizontally.
The division of databases into these ecosystems represents my own analysis of the institutional processes and selection principles which have shaped them. Databases within a shared ecosystem may or may not be interoperable, but they made their initial textual selections with a similar logic, and make make their holdings available for a similar imagined audience. An immediate difference between them, for example, is that the commercial ecosystem treats textual holdings like a trade secret; Google Books and Google Ngrams as impossible to discuss except through the academically-inflected proxy of HathiTrust. Although each individual database has attracted some discussion, they have not been discussed together as an interlocking system. Instead, each database (or cluster of related databases) attracts discussion within its own conventional sphere. A chronological organization, as shown in Table 2, suggests how many different organizations are in fact responding to shared historical conditions, or even to each others’ development, as they make strategic decisions over time. A chronological organization also contrasts with essentially teleological descriptions of individual resources, which tend to work backward from a current state to present a clean narrative of how that current state was discovered to be ideal. By refusing to gloss over dead ends, periods of stagnation, and other oddities, we can better understand the current state of contemporary databases as the outcome of historically contingent processes which might have turned out differently, rather than accepting them uncuriously as inevitabilities.

Also included are events in the development of related resources, such as Early English Books Online (EEBO).

To narrativize this much history is a necessarily lengthy process even when glossing over many details. Some important threads of this history of mass digital archives begin long before the invention of the computer, with the bibliographic collections which served as the extant solutions to the challenge of large-scale text-tracking. The Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640 first appeared in 1926. Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700 appeared in 1951. After the completion of Wing’s STC, “exploratory studies, poorly funded and inadequate though they were” throughout the 1950s and 60s pursued the feasibility of systematically accounting for the much larger body of printed work produced in the eighteenth century. Concurrently, Wing’s seventeenth-century STC was underwent redevelopment into a second edition, overseen by Katharine Pantzer. The second edition of Wing’s STC published its first volume in 1976. This second edition “represented a vast development of the original,” incorporating thousands of new entries, expanding the titles, and adding explanatory notes and headnotes.
The English Short Title Catalogue began as the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue in the 1970s, operating in a similar line as the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640 and Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700. These catalogues established the ambitious simplicity of the ESTC: to accurately describe every edition of every printed work in English or from the United Kingdom. The Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue began properly in 1976, at a conference jointly sponsored by the British Library and the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies. Here, “bibliographers and librarians attempted both to arrive at a consensus of the size of the task and the methodology that would have to be adopted to achieve a union catalogue. However, until the works were catalogued, it would not be possible to answer basic questions (such as the potential number of extant items) which would predetermine working methods. The very fact that they found it difficult to agree for want of sound and accepted figures indicated the need for ESTC.” A pilot project began at the British Library in 1977, under the direction of Robin Alston. Unlike earlier Short-Title Catalogues, which appeared as lengthy print publications, the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue was conceived as digital from the beginning. As a result, “ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work.”  Robin Alston and Mervyn Jannetta developed their own cataloguing rules, distinct from the Library of Congress MARC and UK MARC standards, and cataloguing began.
In 1980, the ESTC began to go online.  As David Vander Meulen has observed, “One implication of the publication history of short-title catalogues is that they have been deemed functional and valuable even before they were complete. (That estimation is crucial, for their full completion is for all practical purposes impossible.) Judging that even a preliminary form of the records was useful to scholars, the planners of ESTC determined to conduct its development ‘in full public view.’” Accordingly, the in-progress database was made available through the British Library BLAISE British LibraryAutomated Information SErvice system in 1980 and through the US Research Libraries Group RLIN Research Libraries Information Network system in 1981.
Meanwhile, the book facsimiles which would become Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) began as in 1983, when the company Research Publications, Inc began to produce its Eighteenth Century Collection microfilm. Research Publications was a newly-founded for-profit company, which was founded in 1981. They and their rival, University Microfilms, produced many of the facsimile images in contemporary databases. Today, the former Research Publications, Inc is part of Gale Cengage, and University Microfilms is part of ProQuest; as ECCO’s history continues, the private company that owns the microfilms will change many times. 1983 also saw the publication of the first subset of the ESTC which was intended to be accessible beyond the librarians and scholars compiling the file. The ESTC intended to publish editions at particular milestones of completeness, intended for the use of non-librarian scholars. The first, a fiche catalogue and index of the British Library’s holdings, was published in a microform “snapshot” in 1983, but other milestones did not occur according to schedule. The joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file which was expected to follow on microform in 1984 did not appear. Alston attributed the delays partly to the immensity of the task, and partly to the impact of short-term cost-cutting decisions, like the reduction of early-stage proofreading or of in-person examination of books, which dramatically increased the labour of verifying the resulting database record. Although he consistently warned “how easily strategic decisions based exclusively on cost usually lead to greater, not less, eventual costs,” the ESTC each year seemed to be facing a new budget struggle, and important maintenance labour was several times deferred. This created something like a paradox for the ESTC: funding bodies wanted to commit less money to a project which was behind schedule, but the project would remain behind schedule unless it was funded to complete the work required. 
Nonetheless, work continued, and in 1985, the online databases in RLIN and BLAISE were upgraded to allow dynamic updates to a single shared file, which for the first time allowed continuous access to a shared record, rather than the constant exchange and messy merging of individual partially-overlapping records. To facilitate its use, the ESTC distributed a manual for searching the online file, and M. J. Crump took the opportunity of the update to rhapsodize on the database’s potential usefulness for other scholars: “No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page.” This valuable resource was not without cost. Although the manual on how to formulate search queries was free, use of the ESTC itself was notably not. Institutions or individuals paid to subscribe to the ESTC itself, paid per query for searches to be run, paid per minute for being connected to the database, and often paid for access to the computers they must use in their own libraries. Tabor says “the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing.” The second volume of the second edition of the STC was published in 1986. In 1987, the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue expanded its scope to include all materials from the origins of print in Britain to 1800, changing its name to the English Short Title Catalogue.
The 1990s, which saw an explosion of activity fuelled by the popularization of the internet for crowdsourced group-knowledge projects like Project Gutenberg and Wikipedia, were quieter for eighteenth-century academic databases. The second edition of the STC completed its publication in 1991, with a set of exhaustive indexes to its material. Its completion in 1991 also marked the end of the ability of its publisher and sponsor, the Bibliographical Society, to support it. Meanwhile, the facsimiles making up the Eighteenth Century Collection changed hands: by 1997, Research Publications, Inc had become Primary Source Media. In 1998, the Thomson Corporation merged Primary Source Media with two other subsidiaries—Gale Research and the Information Access Company (IAC)—to create a new company called The Gale Group. In 1999, the ESTC officially took over responsibility for hosting and updating STC data. The primary development in the academic world during the 1990s was the beginning of Early English Books Online. University Microfilms had begun microfilming books in the 1980s as the chief rival for Research Publications, Inc, and by the late 1990s, several thousand reels had been published in two series: ‘Early English Books, 1475–1640’ and ‘Early English Books, 1641–1700’.” University Microfilms became ProQuest, and in 1998, ProQuest began to make available digitised copies of its microfilms across the internet to subscribing institutions — the early days of Early English Books Online (EEBO). The next year, the Text Creation Partnership was formed, to produce human-corrected but machine-readable transcripts of EEBO texts. This partnership was a collaboration between the university libraries of Michigan and Oxford, the Council on Library and Information Resources, and ProQuest, to produce polished transcriptions of the page images which EEBO was making available. ECCO emerged four years after the beginnings of EEBO, when, in 2003, Thomson Gale (now Gale Cengage Learning) made digital copies of Eighteenth Century Collection microfilms available to subscribers online. In 2005, the TCP began encoding ECCO texts, as a somewhat-experimental alternative to the transcripts already produced by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. In both cases, the timing suggests that eighteenth century texts are growing more accessible to scholars primarily as a response to developments in EEBO, and Gale’s competition with ProQuest.
The largest impact on the landscape of digital book repositories was the announcement of Google Print in 2004. Google partnered with major libraries and publishers to gain access to what they estimated at more than 15 million volumes, and set the goal to scan them all. Eighteenth century works were also included, almost incidentally. In 2006, the ESTC was made available to search for free online, and began adding more information to its listings, to include full title and imprint transcripts. Meanwhile, Google had scanned almost unthinkable numbers of new books. In 2008, however, Google begin to face legal repercussions for their “scan first and ask questions later” approach to mass digitization. A court case led by the Authors Guild contended that Google violated copyrights on a massive scale by allowing users to search inside books and see “snippets” of relevant pages. At first these legal challenges did not slow things down— Google Books began the 2010s by announcing, in mid-2010, that they had scanned more than 12 million books and intended to scan all known existing 129,864,880 books within a decade. At the end of 2010, they launched the Google Ngram viewer, as a research tool borne of all their scanning. Meanwhile, however, their legal court case continued, and scanning began to slow in 2012 as rulings were made and appealing in escalating courts. In April 2016, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the Authors Guild's appeal, which means the lower court's decision stood, and Google would be allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law — and also meant, therefore, that they could not display more than snippets, even in cases of “copyright orphans” (out of print works with unreachable authors), which Google had hoped to be able to sell access to.
Much has been written outside academic circles about the odd half-death of Google Books, and more than one journalist has taken the position that academics and librarians are partly responsible for killing what could have been an enormous public good. In the long term, its impact in scholarly circles has been to create the underlying condition for HathiTrust, by leaving individual libraries as custodians of photographs of their own books. These libraries have a clearly valuable resource in the images, but Google did not create the images with libraries in mind. As was evident in our case study of Charlotte Smith above, Google often duplicated scholarly work by re-digitizing books that already existed in facsimile. More problematically, Google hindered the ability of book historical research to use its facsimiles by maintaining very little information about these facsimiles. Google Books itself is infamous for inaccurate dates; HathiTrust matches books to library catalogue records to provide slightly more information than Google’s baseline, but there is a true missed opportunity in the lack of clear links between the Google ecosystem of digitized books and the academic ecosystem.
Databases of Eighteenth-Century Literature, 1789-99
Returning to the eighteenth century, and how it has been digitized: the baseline hypothesis, investigating a historical phenomenon, is that factors like systemic sexism are likely to have an effect. As I have shown above, the digital archives currently used by eighteenth-century scholars were created during their own historic moments, which influenced their priorities as texts were digitized. Resources which provide more information about particular works — such as ECCO, which provides PDF scans of microfiche, or the TCP, which provides detailed XML-encoded transcripts — inevitably provide their more thorough information about fewer texts. The ESTC is able to include so many works in its database in part because it includes so little about each work: not much more than the information found on the title page, and a list of libraries where the original can be consulted. Google Books (the source of HathiTrust’s images) achieved its scale in part by dramatically reducing the detail and precision of each work’s records. As the more resource-intensive archives created their digital surrogates, therefore, the texts they include are likely to be less indiscriminate, and more strongly influenced by a personal assessment of what works are most important. In many other areas, writing by women has been dismissed as less important or worthy of serious study than writing by men. If we compare the holdings of major digital archives, do the smaller and more resource-intensive archives show evidence of similar choices to systematically opt out of an investment in women’s writing?
Guillory’s Cultural Capital proposes that, if female authors, for example, do not make up a demographically accurate 50% of our literary syllabi, this is not necessarily because women’s writing has been excluded or repressed. Guillory draws a distinction between rhetoric “construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power” — that is, the patriarchal suppression of works by women, which can be addressed by now ‘representing’ the excluded works within the canon — versus what he sees as the real cause, a historical fact that “women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” Applied to the digital database, the first explanation, which might be termed the ‘exclusion hypothesis,’ would manifest in the form of massive archives with large numbers of works by men and women, which get filtered through exclusionary scholarly processes into smaller, selective repositories where men now make up an oversized share. In the second explanation, which might be termed the ‘absence hypothesis,’ works by women will have a diminished role from the very beginning, since women were prevented from writing in the first place.
I have taken information from four resources most strongly targeted to scholars of eighteenth century literature, namely, the English Short Title Catalogue, Eighteenth Century Collections Online, HathiTrust, and the Text Creation Partnership. Since it would be infeasible in many ways to compare the full holdings of all these resources, we much take a consistent sliver from each resource, and compare within those parameter. Let us examine works published in England, between 1789 and 1799. After removing misclassified works, the ESTC contained 51,090 titles, ECCO 26,848 titles, HathiTrust 8,220 titles, and the TCP only 525 titles. ECCO, in all its capaciousness, therefore contains only 52.5% of the titles listed in the ESTC. The TCP provides access to an almost negligible 1% of the works published. At this scale, let us follow the fate of a larger figure than Charlotte Smith herself, and see how “the named woman” fares.
Smaller, less comprehensive archives do generally dedicate a higher percentage of their space to male authors. As Figure 3 shows, 43% of the 51,090 titles in the ESTC from this decade are identifiably by men, which rises substantially to 69% for HathiTrust and 67% for the TCP. 

￼
Figure 3: The percentage of works published in England 1789-99 with male authors, as identified by the ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP.
However, as Figure 4 shows, the increase in male authors is not at the expense of identifiable female authors, who make up a stable or increasing percentage of the works as databases grow more specialized— including an astonishing 22% of the TCP corpus.
￼
Figure 4: The percentage of works published in England 1789-99 with male versus female authors, as identified by the ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP.
The initial number for women, of course, is extremely low: a mere 3%. This is far below the percentage of women found in genre-specific surveys. For example, during the years 1789-99, 20.2% of the new novels written in England were attributed to female names on their title pages and prefaces. The ESTC and ECCO have a lot of medical texts, sermons, natural histories, legal opinions, and other genres from which women are de factor excluded. HathiTrust’s slight increase in female authorship might show a collections-level bias where university libraries prefer slightly more interesting or recognizably “literary” materials like novels, poetry, and drama, all of which allowed for female authorship. But even if the TCP were assumed to contain exclusively novels, at 22% female authorship it would be statistically overrepresenting women. The TCP is the one operating based on the most recent decision-making, since even HathiTrust is constrained to the library collecting decisions of past decisions, and thus doesn’t necessarily reflect the priorities of 2000s scholars.
In Figure 5, however, we can see that the overlooked group, unable to compete with male authors for archival attention, is not “female authors” but “authors which are not associated with an individual personality.” The category “unsigned” here captures works to which no name at all was signed (essentially, anonymous works, though in this period of course the absence of a name does not imply the concealment of a name as it would in the contemporary definition of “anonymous”) as well as pseudonymous works which offered no clues to an author’s gender (e.g. “A friend of peace”). “Organizations” include missives from various branches of the government, reports from scholarly and charitable organizations, catalogues from various companies, and other works which are easily rejected as “non-literary.” The identifier “blank,” for ECCO, appears to capture both unsigned works and works by organizations.

￼
Figure 5: The relative authorship status of works published in England 1789-99, as identified by the ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP. Works by “org” are attributed to organizations as their authors, such as the House of Commons. “Unsigned” works have no information in the author field. “Blank” in ECCO captures both unsigned works and works by organizations, which I have not yet been able to distinguish. Works by “initials” include those by, e.g., W.H. Ireland, even when the database has provided a clearly gendered expansion of the initials (e.g., a listing of “W[illiam] H[enry] Ireland”), to reflect the fact that the original author listing was of ambiguous gender. From my casual inspection, in nearly all cases of attributed to initials where a known author name is also supplied, the author is male. An author will be identified as “male” or “female” rather than as “initials” if, in addition to the initials, a gendered title is provided, e.g., “Mrs. R.” The “uncategorized” works are those which I have not manually assessed; anecdotally, these appear to consist mostly of pseudonyms, mostly male.

There are two ways to explain the disappearance of unsigned authors from smaller corpora. The first explanation is that unsigned authors have, essentially, faced discrimination due to their status as unsigned: out of a fixed pool of unsigned works, fewer were chosen for further scholarly dissemination than from the pool of signed works. The second explanation is that the further dissemination of a work, or scholarly investment in a work, reduces the likelihood that it will remain unsigned in the database. For an author to appear as “unsigned” here, they need not only be absent from the title page, but they also need to have avoided a later scholarly attribution of authorship. Names are placed into the relevant database fields wherever possible, supplying new information that cannot be found on the title page and may have been entirely unavailable to eighteenth century readers. Ann Radcliffe’s first novel, for example, was published unsigned, and the next several editions identified her as the “authoress” of the previous works, and only with the third edition of The Romance of the Forest did the name “Ann Radcliffe” appear on the book. All of the earlier editions, however, are consistently linked to Ann Radcliffe as the author in the internal database, and in the data I was able to access. There is obvious practical use in disseminating author identifications — indeed, there is very little point in determining the authors of pseudonymous works if this information is not fully incorporated into the scholarly record. But this particular implementation also occludes how eighteenth century readers actually encountered author information. An identified name overwrites the information recorded on the title page. In this way, scholars have worked to infrastructurally eliminate the “unsigned” author.
Rather than finding bias against authors based on the social category of gender, then, I have found a much stronger bias in favour of a particular concept of the author itself. These resources assume, in their very infrastructure, that the “author” must be reducible to a single, known individual. ECCO so thoroughly rejects the idea that organizations could be considered as “authors” that it does not record them in the “author” field. The underrepresentation of unsigned or corporate authors cannot be mapped onto the multicultural rhetoric of political representation, the way Guillory has described with gendered representation. Instead, the meaning of this finding stems from the very lack of a broader social importance to “unsigned” or “non-individual” authors as a class of humans: the conclusions we can draw here are not about the world at large, but about the institutional processes of academic research.
“Representativeness” in Databases
Returning to the idea of “representativeness” — what it means for a database to “represent” or be “representative of” a population — returns us, also, to the still-fraught relationship between distant reading and the conception of the literary canon. Twenty years after Guillory, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain,” now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” is the problem of conceiving of a “world” literature, rather than the “canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature.” His new methods are meant to enable literary studies to examine a new object. The field of distant reading has been moving away from Moretti himself. However, it is still shaped by the attempt to redefine the disciplinary domain of literary studies. In many cases, the new domain is no longer the “canon” but the “corpus,” a collection of texts which are studied en masse for macroanalytical insights. Katherine Bode, for example, in “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading,” argues that Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers replicate the approaches of New Criticism with their corpora, and calls for “a new scholarly object of analysis” that directly examines historical and textual context of corpora as representations of “literary systems.” Lauren Klein, too, treats the textual corpus as the new object of literary analysis requiring curation, contextualization, and interpretation. Her critique argues that “it’s not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading can’t do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so.” Bode, too, despite her strong critique of distant reading as it has been practiced by Moretti and Jockers, does not blame distant reading itself. Distant readers like Moretti and Jockers, she argues, “while claiming direct and objective access to ‘everything,’ … represent and explore only a very limited proportion of the literary system, and do so in an abstract and ahistorical way.” Klein, like Bode, calls for “more corpora—more accessible corpora—that perform the work of recovery or resistance” to allow research “beyond quote ‘representative’ samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole.” This framing re-creates, at the site of the corpus, the identical narratives of exclusion and representation which were previously located in critiques of the canon.
The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus, on the surface of it, is not without grounds. Challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new “great unread.” Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. However, what we learn from these case studies, of Charlotte Smith and of the 1790s at large, is that the decisions made about inclusion and exclusion from digital databases simply do not mirror the decisions made in syllabi or anthologies.
I contend that each database is best understood as a negotiation between the noncommercial values of textual reproduction and the commercial environment in which institutions much remain financially solvent. Each database has the goal of making valuable information available. After the 1990s, they are particularly influenced by the utopian ideal that digital reproduction at last made textual reproduction free. Each had to contend, however, with the fact that before a text can be reproduced digitally it must be created digitally, and that even if the material costs are entirely eliminated (which, of course, they are not) textual creation continues to have costs in labour. In Paddy Bullard’s “Digital Humanities and Electronic Resources in the Long Eighteenth Century,” which surveys the research completed and the resources used as of 2013, Bullard is also faced with the task of explaining why multiple services interact so poorly. Bullard, too, observes the core tension between public access vs private profit: 
Viewing the field of eighteenth-century digital humanities as a single prospect, it is the contrast between publicly funded, open-access sites, and privately owned, subscription-access resources that is most striking. Each side of the divide has much to learn from the other. Publicly funded academic projects must acquire the pragmatism and ambitiousness of scale that commercial developers have always shown. Commercial developers must adapt themselves more generously to the principles of scholarly openness and accuracy. They might also imitate the inventiveness of the open sector, its adaptability to the demands raised by different kinds of primary media. Both sides recognize the desirability of making their resources interoperable across the divide, and the business of interconnectivity will preoccupy all kinds of digital humanist in the coming decade.
Bullard is correct to note that there are major disjunctions between databases like the The British Book Trade Index or careful online editions like The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674–1913, compared to massive archives like ECCO. It seems odd, however, to attribute to ECCO both “ambitiousness of scale” and “pragmatism” as the lessons for noncommercial projects to imitate, since an ambitious scale is only plausibly pragmatic for a project with the money to sustain itself. Even odder is the idea that commercial developers might voluntarily choose to “adapt themselves more generously to the principles of scholarly openness and accuracy,” when the core business model of a private enterprise relies on its lack of openness, and private access only seems worth purchasing when its marketers suppress all nuance about accuracy. As Bode observes, “the commercial imperatives of these enterprises arguably depend on them presenting these collections as comprehensive.” In other words, Bullard has observed an underlying system of profit and non-profit organizations in awkward competition, examined the outputs of each approach in order to articulate their particular virtues, and finally described what a ‘best of both worlds’ might look like if both parts of the system sought to collaborate together on how best to achieve maximally useful scholarly resources. What Bullard overlooks in this process is that not all parts of this system have the goal of achieving maximally useful scholarly resources.
Bullard suggests tentatively that university presses might be the site of bridging efforts between the non-profit and for-profit worlds, but where we can actually see an example occurring is in the Text Creation Partnership. The TCP attempted to intervene in the system with “a public-private partnership, led by libraries;” their materials emphasize the “librarian’s attitude toward content” which prioritizes the widest possible access and use. This “librarian’s attitude” is most evident in the (eventual) availability of all of the transcriptions in the public domain, despite the fact that the images they are based on remain privately restricted by the companies which own them.
Their description of the “partnership,” however, continues to show signs of the strain in value systems when commercial and noncommercial goals are intertwined: “Through our partnership with private vendors, we had access to a huge trove of images from which to transcribe. In return, these companies were supplied with a full-text index to their images —work which would have otherwise been difficult or expensive to produce.” In other words, through purchasing a service (access to images), the academic institutions received that service. These academic institutions carried out an enormous feat of labour at their own expense, using the service they purchased. Then, “in return,” they provided the results of their labour to the company, for the company to then further profit from the improvements to their service. Most telling, here, is the word “otherwise” in calling this “work which would have otherwise been difficult or expensive to produce.” The suggestion here is that, without the TCP, the companies themselves would not have been willing to undertake the encoding that was so desired by the users of their service. However, the TCP certainly did not make the task any less difficult or expensive. Instead, academic institutions absorbed the difficulty and expense on those companies’ behalf. I do not say that they were wrong to do so: on the contrary, the “librarian’s attitude” mirrors my own attitude, and it is surely to everyone’s benefit for a wonderful thing to exist even if that wonderful thing is not profitable. Rather, I highlight this rhetorical moment in the TCP’s self description to suggest that it takes two to collaborate, and that no amount of effort on the librarians’ part can change the core institutional drive of a private company. Companies like Gale are perfectly happy to help achieve maximally useful scholarly resources if doing so it also a good way to turn a profit, but this does not mean that they have the same goals as academic institutions. One of the three key aims of the TCP identified on the homepage is to “collaborate with commercial providers, rather than constantly bargaining and competing with them.” However, the TCP seems instead to have simply come up with a better bargain, one which creatively offers scholarly labour as a bargaining chip.
What do these database histories mean for scholars of eighteenth century literature? First and foremost, these histories provide another reminder that scholarly materials do not exist prior to interpretation or intervention. It is not merely that they are shaped or influenced by their institutional contexts, implying small quirks or edge cases which can generally be ignored: they are constituted in the first place by those institutional contexts. Second, these histories suggest a course of action to be taken in response to the specific institutional factors constituting each database. Scholars periodically acknowledge the gaps between historical events as they occurred and the specific archive, database, or corpus that they are using as a proxy for the idealized concept of “the historical record,” but these acknowledgements typically take the form of a statement that some form of bias is assumed to exist, but that this bias is so unknowable and unavoidable that naturally we will just continue onward as if it was not present. Identifying the specific institutional process that led to the current digital infrastructure undermines efforts to brush off these details as unknowable: directly investigating the actual demographics of each resource’s holdings can also render these biases no longer unavoidable.
Conclusion
As archivists and librarians often note, “the archive” is not only a concept to be brought into play with literary theory, but a specific and materially constructed space, shaped by archivist labor and constraints. A digital archive is no different. To explain the current contents of online databases like ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and the TCP, we must look to histories that begin before the internet itself. Recognizing that they are historically constructed resources, we can be alert to selection factors that cause all of them, even the most comprehensive, to differ from the imagined prior whole of “literature” which we might wish for them to represent. More importantly, attention to their particular details reveals that the systemic selection factors that have defined their gaps and exclusions do not always map onto the demographics we dedicate the most attention to recovering. Corporate business models are likely to play as large a role as social biases. Scholarly infrastructure can create new demographics like “the unsigned author” which do not constitute an identity category in the real world. And sometimes success creates its own new puzzles: it is a valuable accomplishment of the TCP, for example, that it has increased the availability of writing by women — but it seems prudent for researchers to assume that using the TCP to gather samples of works published in England during the late eighteenth century will yield samples which do not reflect the population. Unless researchers takes explicit steps to the contrary, these samples will not reflect eighteenth century history, but their own.</Text>

            <Title>TCP selection</Title>
            <Text>What is in the TCP? Well, when active transcription was taking place, “users (especially those affiliated with partner libraries) were welcome to request works from EEBO that had not yet been keyed, and that their requests would go to the top of the queue” (TCP “FAQ”). So — the TCP contains whatever individual works happened to interest particular scholars.

The TCP, unlike the ESTC and ECCO, intentionally avoids including multiple editions of a given work. This decision was a pragmatic one motivated by “limited funding” and a sense of scarcity: “Simply put, for every book that we chose to convert, a different book does not get converted: duplication, even partial duplication, has its costs” (TCP “FAQ”). Since the TCP never envisioned itself as a fully complete collection, the priority in textual selection “was always to capture as many different works and as great a variety of text as we could, usually focusing on the first edition of each work”(TCP “FAQ”). To a certain extent, this lack of duplication can be useful for text-mining: it places all texts on an equal playing field, rather than double-dipping on some works. However, they “have keyed additional editions where there is sufficient justification for doing so, and a user has made a case for it,” so the corpus cannot be assumed to contain no duplicated works (TCP “FAQ”).

“Selection of works to transcribe for EEBO Phase 1 was initially based on named authors mentioned in the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature.  Though this tended to bias selection a bit toward canonical, or at least attributed, works, anonymous works may also have been selected at this stage if their titles appeared in the bibliography. The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature was chosen as a guideline because it included foundational works as well as less canonical titles related to a wide variety of fields, not just literary studies. In any case, this initial reliance on the New Cambridge soon gave way to a series of deliberate attempts to cast a wider net, for example by selecting works exemplifying a particular theme (food, drugs, piracy, witchcraft), or fitting a particular format (broadsides, pamphlets, etc.)  The intention was to supplement methodical selection with more or less random selection based on arbitrary criteria in order to expand the generic diversity of the corpus. Requests for particular works by faculty at partner institutions were also taken into consideration and, if feasible, placed at the head of the queue. A user willing and able to make a case for a given work almost always prevailed over other considerations.” (TCP “EEBO”)

“Discussion then began on how to further develop the TCP project and insure that we can create 25,000 texts. In order to do this, the Board felt that it needed more information about the complete number of texts possible to include in the corpus, a dollar amount per title required to complete the project, a report on the total number of institutions, and the gap between EEBO subscribers and EEBO-TCP partners. Shawn Martin will work with Mary Sauer-Games to gather this information and report back to the Board. Some members thought that EEBO-TCP should go back to already existing partners and ask for a second round of funds to complete the project. In order to do this, Board members felt EEBO-TCP should look very carefully at what titles it is selecting and come up with summaries of the number of desirable titles to convert and initiate a strategy that could persuade libraries that it would be worth another years commitment to complete, for example, all of the Thomason tracts, or all of a particular genre or canonical category.” (TCP Executive Board, “Meeting Minutes 2005-10-20.”)

“Shawn Martin then discussed the selection process for all of the TCP projects. Though there are commonalities between them, selection runs differently for all 3 projects and each project runs fairly independently. Therefore, it becomes a question of how much should TCP coordinate collection between the three projects and how should TCP manage duplication. Scholars prefer that TCP duplicate titles between EEBO, Evans, and ECCO; librarians prefer to avoid duplication. The Board felt that it should receive a report of all duplicated materials, that TCP create an oversight group of librarians to coordinate the three projects, and where feasible TCP should try to minimize duplication.” (TCP Executive Board, “Meeting Minutes 2005-10-20.”)

 “To users working with the EEBO-TCP texts, the ECCO-TCP texts may form a useful adjunct, since for the latter some attempt was made to select works by authors who straddled the divide between the 17th and 18th centuries, the thought being that authors whose earlier works we had included in our 17th-century corpus could be “completed” by having their later works included in our 18th-century (ECCO-TCP) corpus. That helps account (for example) for the heavy representation of Defoe in ECCO-TCP.” (TCP, “Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) TCP”)</Text>

            <Text>I was trying to figure out how in the world I had 320,000 rows.
It looks like ECCO0 and ECCO1 are mostly duplicates of each other, but with ECCO0 prefixing “ESTC” to the ESTC number (and having field 752 empty, but whatever). I used the GREL value(‘ESTC’,’’) to remove those preceding ESTCs, then sorted by column 001 (permanently) to place duplicates next to each other. Except actually OpenRefine crashed when I tried to do that.

The other problem appears to be that it is not just the 90s! (And not just England, of course)

Just to make the file smaller and easier to work with, I started filtering out obviously unwanted things: 21237 with Dublin as pub place, 20152 with Edinburgh or Glasgow, 11397 other pub places
Tried to make a “clean date” by removing roman numerals, brackets, and periods so I could filter by year (limited success)
Removed everything that matched the filter “175” for 1750s (manual read-through of date facet indicated no false positives) - 22196 rows
Repeated with 170.
Did a lot more cleaning of the dates…
Removed everything that didn’t match the filter for the regex 1789|179[0123456789] — 145267 rows!!

Finally down to 54141 rows — all works are from the 90s, though not all from England.

Then I stripped ESTC from the ESTC nos, sorted by that no, blanked down, and removed the 22946 rows which now had blank ESTC nos, to remove duplicates.
Unfortunately this reduced my ability to filter based on 752, which had such good regularized location data, but at least I could remove 2,599 titles that had non-blank 752 data and filter didn’t match “England”

Basically had a geography quiz manually scrolling through and removing pub locations that weren’t England. If a place with the same name existed in England and outside England, eg Plymouth, I assumed it was the English location unless additional information ruled that out.

FINALLY got down to 26848 rows for just England and just 1790s!!!
Aiming for 25,720 to do 95.8%

I’m not seeing enough orgs… are my “unsigned” titles actually misclassified “org” titles? Due to MARC problems?

            <Text>For the purposes of this chapter, I examine Smith’s works which fall outside this dissertation’s decade of interest. As Table &lt;$n#table:Smith-4dbs&gt; shows, Smith’s publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith’s “full” output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. Her 1790s output (that is, the editions published 1789-99) consists of 30 of those editions.  I have slightly expanded my chronological focus in part because some of the most interesting exclusions occur earlier and later in Smith’s publishing career, such as the first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), which is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere, or the publications in the last years of her life, which are excluded from the chronological focus of most resources but can still appear in HathiTrust. Of particular interest is the fact that Beachy Head, which is now one of Smith’s most frequently anthologized and taught poems, does not appear in a single digital database. None of these inclusions or exclusions represent an agenda against (or for) Smith, or indeed an interpretive choice at all, but they nonetheless shape the disciplinary infrastructure.</Text>

            <Title>Bode on Underwood &amp; Hathi</Title>
            <Text>“Of the data-rich literary history projects discussed in this chapter, Underwood and Sellers’s work on changing standards of literary prestigePage 51 → most consistently enacts the curatorial elements present elsewhere in digital humanities, not least in terms of data publication. As the authors explain in an online working paper on the project, its most time-consuming element was not training their supervised model but constructing their dataset: identifying the different subgenres—poetry, prose, fiction, and drama—present in HathiTrust (“How,” 6). As well as publishing the datasets and code used in their article (“Code”), in collaboration with HathiTrust Underwood takes the major, additional step of releasing the outcome of analysis of that mass-digitized collection for others to use. This takes the form of “word counts for 101,948 volumes of fiction, 58,724 volumes of poetry, and 17,709 volumes of drama” published from 1700 to 1922, as well as yearly summaries of word frequencies for each genre. Underwood refers to this dataset as a “collection” to differentiate it from a “corpus” because “I don’t necessarily recommend that you use the whole thing, as is. The whole thing may or may not represent the sample you need for your research question” (“Dataset” np).
Signifying growing recognition of the importance of data publication, the Underwood/HathiTrust collection is an important undertaking for data-rich literary history in at least two ways. In presenting a dataset designed for literary history, it offers a shared foundation for research. Working with it, researchers can ask a range of questions based on a reliable, standardized dataset and engage with each other’s arguments in terms not only of results produced but of data investigated. In characterizing that collection as the holdings of “American university and public libraries, insofar as they were digitized in the year 2012 (when the project began), Underwood also frames a major mass-digitized collection—HathiTrust—in terms of its history of transmission (“Dataset” np). However general this framing, Underwood thus explicitly associates the dataset he publishes with a sequence of production and reception that profoundly affects its capacity to support historical analysis. In their article, Underwood and Sellers acknowledge that this history of transmission shapes their findings, noting that their model “makes more accurate” predictions for American poetry collections because HathiTrust “mainly aggregates the collections of large American libraries” (“Longue” 338).” (Bode 50-51)

“Seeking to define the scope of their dataset, Underwood and Sellers note that HathiTrust “may represent more than half of the titles that were printed” because it contains “about 58% of titles recorded in standard bibliographies.” Yet their own “work on fiction” with this collection belies the apparently solid basis of this estimate, finding that HathiTrust contains “many titles left out of” existing bibliographies (“How” n11). Underwood and Sellers thus indicate a significant lack of overlap between established bibliographical records and the holdings of a major digital library, although they do not highlight the significance of this finding nor explore its implications for their own study or for literary history broadly (whether conducted by computational or noncomputational means). Emphasizing that we cannot know the documentary past except through the knowledge infrastructure we create to interpret it, this disjunction that Underwood and Sellers discover highlights the potentially major gaps in all existing forms of description and interpretation: neither the analog nor the digital record offers an unmediated and comprehensive view of the documentary past; both are partial, and not necessarily in complementary ways.” (Bode 53)</Text>

            <Text>Provisional title: “Women’s books in digital databases, 1789-99: corpora are not the new canons.”
My essay examines how we remediate early Romantic women’s books today in digital databases. I argue that these digital resources operate structurally according to a logic that is familiar from longstanding debates about literary canons: some works are granted more prominence, and are reproduced by scholarly institutions, in ways that lead to new distant reading research being conducted on collections of texts which look suspiciously similar to old canonically-restrictive syllabi. Seeking parallels between the development of distant reading research and John Guillory’s history of the cultural capital of literary canons, we can also see how responses to underrepresentation of women in corpora mirror responses to their underrepresentation in syllabi, particularly in the creation of specialized smaller databases solely for women’s writing. Drawing parallels between the institutional impact of selective canons and selective corpora also reveals, however, the important ways in which digital resources do not simply function as new literary canons. Indeed, using the same rhetoric of representation to critique digital scholarly tools can deflect attention away from novel challenges which require novel solutions.
To make my argument, I study a sample of late eighteenth century writing, consisting of all works identified as being published in England between 1789 and 1799 within several major databases. I trace the inclusion and exclusion of works by women in the English Short Title Catalogue, Eighteenth Century Collections Online, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation partnership, HathiTrust, and Project Gutenberg. Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building (that is, the accumulation of a large body of text files for analysis) to the interpretation of distant reading research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little information regarding what they include. I have written a customized program for each database to infer a probable gender for each author, and to infer a probable broad genre for each title. I then compare each database’s demographics to prior scholarly attempts to describe the period, such as Peter Garside and James Raven’s bibliographic survey The English Novel 1770-1829. These comparisons form the basis for a broader reading of the positions occupied by Romantic women’s books in the works published in the 1790s, and in contemporary digital resources.</Text>

            <Title>chapter 3: databases</Title>
            <Text>In chapter three, I re-examine my core databases, but no longer with Smith as a focalizing lens. Instead, I undertake computational assessment and comparison of the databases’ contents. My research examines the authorship and subject matter (broadly construed) of all titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799 which are included in each database. I calculate the proportion of the titles in each resource that are attributed to men, to women, or are left unsigned. My naive hypothesis is that, as each resource demanded a greater investment of scholarly effort in each text, women and unsigned writers will grow increasingly underrepresented, so that the ECCO-TCP corpus will have substantially different demographics than the ESTC. Using the titles of these works and a topic modelling tool which I have built, I also roughly identify the subject matter of each title, categorizing works into broad genres such as drama, poetry, Romance, History, or sermons. Although the topic modelling tool is able to cluster what it sees as “similar” titles, individual interpretation is required to make these clusters meaningful. A substantial portion of chapter three is dedicated to discussing how scholars apply genre categories retrospectively to clusters of texts, how publishers sought to advertise their texts to particular audiences, and how the categories I develop ought to be understood in the context of existing eighteenth century scholarship on print genres. Using my resulting genre classifications, I am then able to compare these four resources to each other, and to existing scholarly work on the print production of the 1790s. For example, I compare each resource’s holdings to the statistics on the English novel included in Garside, Raven and Schöwerling’s Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction. In examining genres, I anticipate discovering a preference, in the more specialized resources, for more “literary” forms of writing.
I will also correlate gender and genre. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller corpora. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of exclusion. Asking bibliographical questions of multiple corpora, in order to learn about the corpora themselves, emphasizes an under-examined stage of text mining research, and provides a basis for other scholars to use these corpora more precisely.</Text>

            <Text>“two pervasive theoretical assumptions" implicit in the current canon debate: (6)
1. term ‘canon’ as replacement for ‘classics’ seeks to critique 'classics’, and treats the “traditional curriculum of literary texts" as equivalent to a closed and normative object akin to the scriptural canon. (6)
--- interrogate: is the selection of religious texts actually similar, historically, to the selection of literary texts? (a historical Q subject to proof or disproof) (6)
2. assumed similarity between exclusion (in which social minorities are excluded from power of political representation) and selection (by which some works are deemed canonical and others noncanonical). assumes that the solution is easy, add minorities to canon. (7)
--- interrogation: there is *some* relationship between minorities in power and minorities in canon, but what is it? the university intervenes between these two sites of representation. (7)

“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
the ultimate “policy" position of opening the canon is seen as too politically important to allow theoretical objections to complicate its plan (because canonical representation is now standing in for political representation) (11)

Essentialist assumptions in liberal pluralism
“The sense in which a canonical author represents a dominant social group, or a noncanonical author a socially defined minority, is continuous with the sense in which the work is perceived to be immediately expressive of the author's experience as a representative member of some social group. ... The author returns in the critique of canon, not as the genius, but as the representative of a social identity.” (10)
"it has seemed necessary to many progressive critics to present certain texts by minority authors as intrinsically noncanonical, as unassimilable to the traditional canon.” (9)

Need to consider class
his post-Marxist critique is different from a liberal pluralist critigue because he is "insisting on the theoretical and practical incommensurabiliy of the terms race, class, and gender: the modes of domination and exploitation specific to each of these socially defined minorities thus cannot be redressed by the _same_ strategy of representation.” (11)
"The fact of incommensurability explains why the revisionist critique of the canon has in practice been incapable of identifying 'noncanonical' works by lower-class writers who are not already identified by race or gender.” (14)
lumping together race, class, and gender as all "noncanonical” "equates their works as the expression of analogous experiences of marginalization” (11)

"The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
"Within the history of canon formation we will always be able to discern the arrangement and rearrangement of (1) an institutional practice, or pedagogy; (2) a body of preserved and disseminated writings, or canon; and (3) a produced linguistic knowledge” (71)
“Canonical texts, institutionally preserved and disseminated, constitute the paradigmatic basis of literary language, the guarantor at the lower educational levels of simple grammatical speech, the exemplar, at higher levels, of more expansive as well as more elite standards of linguistic use (stylistic or rhetorical rather than simply grammatical norms)” (68)
“If the term 'literature' can be retained to indicate a transhistorical phenomenon at all, it would have to be defined as the canonical genres of writing, whatever these genres happen to be in any particular time or place, and whatever name may have been given to them collectively. We are speaking, then, of certain genres of writing which become paradigmatic for a socially differentiated speech." (69)
“while the standard or 'common' language seems to efface social stratification by making language itself the vehicle of common national identity, the 'literary’ language reinstates at another level a linguistic difference by which the upper classes can continue to mark their cultural distinction.” (78)
the language taught in composition classes “is employed in its place, the ‘office.’ It is not 'everyday' language.” (79), and “its production bypasses the older literary syllabus altogether.” (79)
“The school functions as a system of credentialization by which it produces a specific /relation/ to culture. That relation is different for different people, which is to say that it reproduces social relations." (56)
“The educational institution performs the social function of systematically regulating the practices of reading and writing by governing access to the means of literary production as well as to the means of consumption (the knowledge required to read historical works)." (19)

"So far from being the case that the canon determines the syllabus in the simple sense that the syllabus is constrained to select only from canonical works, it is much more historically accurate to say that the syllabus posits the existence of the canon as its imaginary totality.” (31)
the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)

"The literary curriculum is precisely not the side of mass cultural production and consumption, but the critique of the canon has proceeded as though it were, as though canon formation were like the Academy Awards. ... in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site.” (8)

“The distinction between serious and popular writing is a condition of canonicity” (23)
he's sort of addressing the idea that women are associated with "unserious”, “ephemeral" writing possibly due to sexism which sees women's writing as inherently unserious and ephemeral... but mostly he's talking about popular vs serious (23)

"Institutions of reproduction succeed by taking as their first object not the reproduction of social relations but the reproduction of the institution itself.” (Guillory 57) --MEMES. Do I need meme theory in the diss??

Rebutting the ‘exclusion’ hypothesis
“The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” (15) — yes: and the presence of women in a genre generally made it seem to be ephemeral rather than serious… which isn't QUITE exclusion, but also doesn't seem like it's what Guillory is noting
"the historical process of canon formation, even or especially at the moment of institutional judgment, is too complex to be reduced to determination by the single factor of the social identity of the author” (17) gender may contribute somewhat to the reception of a given author, but it cannot in itself *explain* canonical/noncanonical status
“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is what any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as /excluded/ from the canon.” (16)
"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the /actively/ excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)

Actually, syllabi are created by selection
"Anyone who studies historical literatures knows that the archive contains an indefinite number of works of manifest cultural interest and accomplishment. While these works might be regarded as 'noncanonical' in some pedagogic contexts -- for example, the context of the ‘great works’ survey -- their noncanonical status is not necessarily equivalent in anyone's judgment to a zero-degree of interest or value.” (30)
“Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To contend otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
"This is finally why the project of legitimizing noncanonical works in the university produces an irresolvable contradiction between the presentation of these works as equal in cultural value to canonical works, and at the same time as the embodiment of countercultural values which by their very definition are intended to delegitimize the cultural values embodied in canonical works.” (47)
“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)

“the current critique of the canon both discovers, and misrepresents, the obvious fact that the older the literature, the less likely it will be that texts by socially defined minorities exist in sufficient numbers to produce a 'representative' canon" (15) —  but is this ACTUALLY true??
“Obviously in order to ‘open' this canon, one would have to modernize it, to displace the preponderance of works from earlier to later. And there are of course many good reasons to do so. The pressure to modernize the curriculum has succeeded again and again” (32)

"The decline of the humanities was never the result of newer noncanonical courses or texts, but of a large-scale 'capital flight' in the domain of culture.” (45)
“The relative decline of literary study in the schools is proof that the status of literary works as cultural capital depends to a significant degree upon their status as linguistic capital." (81)
“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its /market/ value." (46)
“If the liberal arts curriculum still survives as the preferred course of study in some elite institutions, this fact has everything to do with the class constituency of these institutions. …it is only those students who belong to the financially secure upper classes who do not feel compelled to acquire professional or technical knowledge as undergraduates." (46)
university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
“There is not, and should not be, one national culture, but there is, and there should be, one educational system." (53) in order to avoid social re-stratification

“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works [by minorities] /because they are important and significant cultural works/. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
"The fact that we no longer read these [classical] works in Greek or Latin, or that we read far fewer classical Greek or Latin works than students of premodern school systems, represents a real loss; but this loss must be reckoned as the price of the /integration/ of these works into a modern curriculum. The inevitable loss of older works in any humanities curriculum…is the result, as we have observed, of the /absolute/ accumulation of cultural works.” (51)
"A politically effective critique of literary education would be better served now by discarding the problematic of representation for a problematic whose object is the systematic constitution and distribution of cultural capital. For if social groups now imagine that they are too different to speak the same language, or to be represented by the same cultural works in the schools, they are nevertheless always exchanging the same currency, even in the symbolic form of cultural capital.” (82)</Text>

            <Text>“ESTC’s most basic bibliographical function is to provide, for each edition, a description of the ideal copy, meaning the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it” (Tabor 369).

“The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,” especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). “Panizzis ‘Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book inhis or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.” (Korshin 211)

“Because the ESTC was formed from three different projects over many decades, the existence of subject headings varies. For books that are from the periods 1475-1640 (from the original Short-Title Catalogue created by Pollard and Redgrave) and 1641-1700 (from Donald Wing’s short-title catalogue), subject headings exist. But subject headings were not initially created for the eighteenth-century records in the ESTC, and so subject headings rarely occur for the items in ECCO.” (Karian, “Guide” 3)

An Edition:
“Because ESTC is a bibliographical database rather than a catalogue, strictly speaking, its records describe groups of copies,” such as editions, “rather than specific copies,” such as the Exeter Book (Tabor 369). The ESTC sometimes has separate entries for groups within an edition “when certain separately planned marketing units can be identified within the edition, such as reissues, imprint variants, and large versus regular-paper copies” (Tabor 369). Or, in “the later eighteenth century, when reprints from standing type became more common, ESTC cataloguers have occasionally granularized down to the level of individual impressions” (Tabor 369). Tabor and I both deem the term “edition” a sufficient umbrella term “[f]or the purpose of this discussion” (Tabor 369).
“The first problem relates to the unit of classification. A clearly defined unit is necessary to ensure that a study of change over time is reliable and based on consistent terms. What is the unit that the ESTC uses? Scholars sometimes answer by using the terms “edition,” “issue,” or “title” interchangeably. But since the ESTC does not rely in a consistent manner on any of these terms for its unit of classification, one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC.” (Karian 289)
“For the most part, the ESTC contains a record for each issue” (Karian 289) “Sometimes the ESTC contains additional records if there are multiple states of an edition (a different state results from cancels or minor changes to the setting of type).” (Karian 289)

An Ideal Copy:
“As additional reports of copies arrive, it may be that the ideal description must change in response. For instance, the existence of a half-title may only emerge on the evidence of the seventh copy reported. A half-title would then be added to the description of the ideal copy, and the six previously matched physical copies will receive notes recording that they are imperfect in this respect” (Tabor 370).
“In ESTC the matching process hinges on five points of identity: the title, as far as it is given by ESTC; the edition statement; the imprint, again as far as it is given by ESTC; the pagination; and the format” (Tabor 370).</Text>

            <Text>Table &lt;$n#table:Smith-4dbs&gt; shows data that I compiled by hand in Numbers. The first three columns are based on my synthesis of scholarship on Charlotte Smith. As I consulted a range of work on Smith, I updated this information to reflect the most complete and accurate information possible. My editorial decisions included, for example, the exclusion of D’Arcy from consideration, since it was never published in England. I introduced standardized titles for the two volumes of Elegiac Sonnets, retroactively naming the initial publication “volume 1” to distinguish it from the second volume which would appear 13 years later, so that each title has its own edition count. The next four columns represent the results of my queries in the ESTC, ECCO, ECCO-TCP, and HathiTrust databases. I searched each database with several queries to locate Smith’s works, beginning (where possible) by finding all works categorized under her authorship, and then searching individual titles of works. This figure shows the simplified results from a more detailed spreadsheet, which also includes links to the records themselves where they exist, and notes on how the records are encoded (e.g., multiple volumes or all as one volume.) Simplifying inclusion down to a boolean yes/no involved some editorial decisions. If only part of a work was included (as in HathiTrust’s record for the first edition of Celestina, which only includes volumes 3 and 4), I recorded that as a “yes.” If a work was only included in its Dublin edition (as in HathiTrust’s record for Desmond), I recorded that as a “no.” These searches were conducted in February 2020.</Text>

            <Title>ESTC</Title>
            <Text>In 1980, the ESTC began to go online.  “One implication of the publication history of short-title catalogues is that they have been deemed functional and valuable even before they were complete. (That estimation is crucial, for their full completion is for all practical purposes impossible.) Judging that even a preliminary form of the records was useful to scholars, the planners of ESTC determined to conduct its development ‘in full public view’ and to make the incomplete file available ‘warts and all’ (in the words of Henry Snyder and Michael Crump, responding to criticism by Peter Blayney)” (Vander Meulen 270). Accordingly, the in-progress database “was soon available online, from 1980 via the British Library BLAISE [British LibraryAutomated Information SErvice] system and from 1981 in the US Research Libraries Group RLIN [Research Libraries Information Network] system” (Norman). Each of these databases was worked on locally by researchers, and then updated and reconciled with each other weekly.
To supplement these databases, accessible almost exclusively to librarians with specialized training in operating them and primarily used by the scholars compiling the file, the ESTC intended to publish editions at particular milestones of completeness, intended for the use of non-librarian scholars. Their “first step, a fiche catalogue of [the British Library’s] holdings, together with indexes, generated by the computer” (Crump 105) was published in a microform “snapshot” in 1983, but other milestones did not occur according to schedule. The “joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file ” (Korshin 212) which was expected to follow on microform in 1984 (Korshin 212) did not appear. Alston attributed the delays partly to the immensity of the task, and partly to the impact of short-term cost-cutting decisions, like the reduction of early-stage proofreading or of in-person examination of books, which dramatically increased the labour of verifying the resulting database record. Although he consistently warned “how easily strategic decisions based exclusively on cost usually lead to greater, not less, eventual costs” (Alston), the ESTC each year seemed to be facing a new budget struggle, and important maintenance labour was several times deferred. This created something like a paradox for the ESTC: funding bodies wanted to commit less money to a project which was behind schedule, but the project would remain behind schedule unless it was funded to complete the work required. 
Nonetheless, work continued, and in 1985, the online databases in RLIN and BLAISE were upgraded to allow dynamic updates to a single shared file (Crump 106), which for the first time allowed continuous access to a shared record, rather than the constant exchange and messy merging of individual partially-overlapping records. “Until the file was dynamically available online on RLIN in 1985 batch processing was a weekly nightmare” (Alston). At this time, it was hoped that the new RLIN file would “result in a more complete and coherent ‘first edition’ of ESTC” to be published in 1989 (Crump 106), though this deadline, too, was not met. In the mean time “the ESTC file [was] available to scholars on both BLAISE-LINE and on RLIN.” (Crump 106). To facilitate its use, the ESTC distributed “[a] simplified manual for searching the file on-line” (Crump 106). Crump took the opportunity of the update to rhapsodize on the database’s potential usefulness for other scholars: “No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page” (106). This valuable resource was not without cost. Although the manual on how to formulate search queries was free, use of the ESTC itself was notably not. Institutions or individuals paid to subscribe to the ESTC itself, paid per query for searches to be run, paid per minute for being connected to the database, and often paid for access to the computers they must use in their own libraries. Tabor says “the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing” (367).
“In 1987, with the agreement of the Bibliographical Society and the Modern Language Association of America, the International Committee approved the extension of the database to cover the period from the beginning of printing in the British Isles (ca. 1472) to 1700. The file changed its name to the 'English Short Title Catalogue', thereby keeping its well-known acronym.”(Norman)</Text>

            <Text>Mary Robinson’s early biography shares striking resonances with that of Charlotte Smith. Robinson was also married at the age of sixteen to a man who squandered his income. Robinson spent more than a year in King’s Bench debtors’ prison with her husband and infant daughter, from 1774 to 1775, from which she published her first volume of poetry. Rather than immediately taking up the mantle of a professional author, however, in 1776 she became an actress. As an actress, she met increasing success for four seasons — so much so that she attracted the attention in 1779 of the 17-year-old Prince of Wales, who determined to make her his mistress. After a period of semi-public flirtation, Robinson agreed, and retired from the stage. “Although the affair lasted less than a year, 'the Perdita' was notorious from then on; her gowns, her carriages, and her alliances became a constant source of discussion and speculation in the newspapers” (Mark Ockerbloom). The Prince of Wales had given her a bond of £20,000 at the start of their relationship, but when their relationship soon ended, he refused to pay. “She demanded £25,000 for the return of the prince's letters. She apparently settled for £5,000, paid by George III ‘to get my son out of this shameful scrape.’ It was enough to stave off her creditors. In 1782, Mary obtained a further £500 annuity for herself, and a £200 annuity during the life of Maria Elizabeth, in return for the surrender of the Prince's bond.” (Mark Ockerbloom). Robinson continued to live in high society and the public eye, involved with Lord Malden, and then with Colonel Banastre Tarleton in a relationship which would be her longest. In 1783, Tarleton’s debts grew pressing, and his family attempted to sever his relationship with Robinson by promising to pay them if he moved to France without her. He left England in July 1783. Robinson, pregnant, borrowed money for his debts and set out alone to intercept him in Dover. The rough travel led to a miscarriage, the mistreatment of which ultimately paralyzed Robinson’s legs and left her with acutely painful rheumatism the rest of her life. For the next five years, Tarleton and Robinson lived variously in France, Germany, and England, variously together and apart. In 1788, Tarleton’s fortunes and Robinson’s health had recovered enough for her to move permanently back to England, and the two established neighbouring households on Clarges Street in London. Over the next decade, they continued their relationship, while Tarleton’s political career and Robinson’s literary one both flourished. In 1797, Tarleton ended the relationship, and in 1798 married a young heiress, to Robinson’s dismay. Her health worsened, and she died 26 December 1800, aged 43.</Text>

            <Text>Reviewed by: 
Thomas Reinert 
p.222: Guillory argues that reforming school syllabi oers only a kind of symptomatic relief for cultural discrimination. Much more important is the exclusivity of schools themselves, and, with them, the forces that work to make literature feel exclusive.
p.222: Guillory argues that schools have repeatedly reconstituted not just the canon but the general practice of literary study so as to align it with the changing interests of the bourgeoisie. In each case, there was a struggle over what it meant socially to study literature, and in each case schools restricted that study to an educated elite by way of insuring literacy’s prestige, class ailiation, and what Guillory calls its “cultural capital.”
p.223: He rejects the view of relativists who believe that aesthetic judgment merely reflects in a roundabout or mystified form a community’s practical interests. The aesthetic has its peculiar feeling and density, he claims; it cannot be reduced to a purely economic eect. On the other hand, neither does it appear apart from political and economic struggle. This is literally true, he argues, in the intellectual history of aesthetic and economic theory.
P.223: . Perhaps most powerful is the chapter on de Man. It moves with remarkable deharisma, Guillory speaks of how de Man brought charisma to routinization. De Man lost his following unjustly as a result of the scandal surrounding his wartime journalism. The critique here of his strange mode of subversiveness makes for a much more satisfactory challenge to his intellectual authority.
p.223-4: The suppleness of the book’s argument overall places Guillory just where it feels right to be. He does not argue for the demolition of the canon or for the abandonment of aesthetic judgment; he advocates, [End Page 223] rather, a struggle to disjoin the study of literature from markers of class prestige and to open up universal access to it. He is, among other things, a lover of books, and he wants everyone to be able to read as many of them as possible.</Text>

            <Title>Gutenberg overview</Title>
            <Text>Also in the category of smaller and specialized archives is Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly work — its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its use and utility. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard, ‘unscholarly’ source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. It narrows the field substantially to exclude works which have either ceased to be broadly interesting (as in the case of most forgotten fiction), or which were never particularly interesting (as in the case of almanacs and tax codes). Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but nonetheless an order of magnitude fewer than its more-voracious potential competitors. And, like smaller specialized scholarly archives, Project Gutenberg has tailored its holdings to make it easy for readers to read, and quite difficult for its collection to be applied to any other use. By tailoring the structure of the archive itself to its specific materials, these collections are able to thoughtfully achieve their aims — but they also make it correspondingly difficult for users to achieve their own, different aims.</Text>
            <Comments>I have heard it quipped more than once in digital humanities gatherings that you always think you’re going to get your texts from somewhere else, but Project Gutenberg is where you’ll actually get them.

            <Text>Wikipedia: “April 2010: Visual artists were not included in the previous lawsuit and settlement, are the plaintiff groups in another lawsuit, and say they intend to bring more than just Google Books under scrutiny. "The new class action," read the statement, "goes beyond Google's Library Project, and includes Google's other systematic and pervasive infringements of the rights of photographers, illustrators and other visual artists."[101]
Wikipedia: “May 2010: It was reported that Google would launch a digital book store called Google Editions.[102] It would compete with Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Apple and other electronic book retailers with its own e-book store. Unlike others, Google Editions would be completely online and would not require a specific device (such as kindle, Nook, or iPad).
Wikipedia: “June 2010: Google passed 12 million books scanned.[12]
Wikipedia: “August 2010: It was announced that Google intends to scan all known existing 129,864,880 books within a decade, amounting to over 4 billion digital pages and 2 trillion words in total.[12]
Wikipedia: “December 2010: Google eBooks (Google Editions) was launched in the US.[103]
Wikipedia: “December 2010: Google launched the Ngram Viewer, which collects and graphs data on word usage across its book collection.[31]
Wikipedia: “March 2011: A federal judge rejected the settlement reached between the publishing industry and Google.[104]

“At a time when the rest of Google was obsessed with making apps more “social”—Google Plus was released in 2011—Books was seen by those who worked on it as one of those projects from the old era, like Search itself, that made good on the company’s mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” It was the first project that Google ever called a “moonshot.”” (Somers)

Wikipedia: “March 2012: Google passed 20 million books scanned.[105][106]
Wikipedia: “March 2012: Google reached a settlement with publishers.[107]
Wikipedia: “November 2013: Ruling in Authors Guild v. Google, US District Judge Denny Chin sides with Google, citing fair use.[109] The authors said they would appeal.[110]
Wikipedia: “October 2015: The appeals court sided with Google, declaring that Google did not violate copyright law.[111] According to the New York Times, Google has scanned more than 25 million books.[10]
Wikipedia: “April 2016: The US Supreme Court declined to hear the Authors Guild's appeal, which means the lower court's decision stood, and Google would be allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law.[112]” (Wikipedia)

Wikipedia: “As of October 2015, the number of scanned book titles was over 25 million, but the scanning process has slowed down in American academic libraries.[10][11] As of October 2019, Google celebrated 15 years of Google Books and provided the number of scanned books as more than 40 million titles.[14]”

Wikipedia: “Google has been quite secretive regarding its plans on the future of the Google Books project. Scanning operations had been slowing down since at least 2012, as confirmed by the librarians at several of Google's partner institutions. At University of Wisconsin, the speed had reduced to less than half of what it was in 2006. However, the librarians have said that the dwindling pace could be a natural result of maturation of the project – initially stacks of books were entirely taken up for scanning whereas now Google only needed to consider the ones that have not been scanned already.[49] The company's own Google Books history page ends in 2007, and the Google Books blog was merged into the Google Search blog in 2012.[113] Despite winning the decade-long litigation in 2017, The Atlantic has said that Google has "all but shut down its scanning operation."[20] In April 2017, Wired reported that there were only a few Google employees working on the project, and new books were still being scanned, but at a significantly lower rate. It commented that the decade-long legal battle had caused Google to lose its ambition.[113]”

Material is still being sent to Google Books for scanning, however. In November 2019, University of Colorado Boulder announced that their library would be partnering with Google for books to be scanned, with copies appearing both in Google Books and in HathiTrust. (“Increasing Access with Google Books”)
“In total, the process is estimated to take two to four years to complete. With this estimation, Interim Director of Libraries Information Technology Michael Dulock approximated that if Google processed 200,000 books and each book was about 200 pages, this project will save the Libraries about $20 million. 
Another way to measure savings for the Libraries is with time. Dulock said that if Digital Media Services in the Libraries worked on this project full-time, with one staff member at 40 hours a week and five students at 20 hours a week, doing nothing else, it would take close to 100 years to complete.” (“Increasing Access with Google Books”)


“HathiTrust was launched in 2008 by the 11 University of California libraries and the 12-university consortium known as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), with key support provided by the University of Michigan and Indiana University.” (Karels) “As of today [October 13, 2008], HathiTrust contains more than 2 million volumes and approximately ¾ of a billion pages, about 16 percent of which are in the public domain. Public domain materials will be available for reading online. Materials protected by copyright, although not available for reading online, are given the full range of digital archiving services, thereby offering member libraries a reliable means to preserve their collections.” (HathiTrust, “Major Library Partners Launch HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository”)
“When Google partnered with university libraries to scan their collections, it had agreed to give them each a copy of the scanning data, and in 2008 the HathiTrust began organizing and sharing those files. (It had to fend off the Authors Guild in court, too.) HathiTrust has 125 member organizations and institutions who “believe that we can better stewardresearch and cultural heritage by working together than alone or by leaving it to an organization like Google,” says Mike Furlough, the trust’s director.” (Van Helden)
“The vast majority of those digitized books-around 95 percent, as of mid-2017- had originally been scanned as part of the Google Books project; the agreements that Google Books entered into with the libraries typically stipulated that Google had to provide the library with a digital copy of each book scanned from that library.” (Bauder)
In 2010, just two years later, ”HathiTrust is now jointly owned and operated by 52 institutions from the U.S. and Europe, all focused on a common goal – to build an extraordinary digital library that preserves and provides access to the cultural record. The new members to HathiTrust include the Library of Congress, Stanford University, Arizona State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and University of Madrid, HathiTrust’s first international partner.” (Karels)
”In October 2015, HathiTrust comprised over 13.7 million volumes, including 5.3 million of which were in the public domain in the United States.” (Wikipedia)</Text>

            <Title>conclusion</Title>
            <Text>As this brief survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no ‘perfect’ corpus for large scale study of eighteenth-century texts.  Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. As this dissertation will argue, these questions of digital history have important resonance with literary questions about literary canon formation.</Text>

            <Text>account for the impact over time of works which cannot extend back in influence to before they were written, but most certainly do extend forward infinitely; no work is confined to a single moment.
Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.
When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.
(Am I impressed by longevity?? I think what matters to me here is that this is a way that "normal", "average" books have great impact: they form a context/mediascape that only makes sense as a whole.)</Text>

Comparative Drama, Volume 30, Number 4, Winter 1996-1997, pp. 558-560 (Review) 
p.559: n analysis of the most performed plays of the decade reveals that audiences enjoyed complicated plots, comic resolutions, traditional scenes of young love winning out over all odds. This is especially true of the theater up to the Terror; "patriotic entertainments" abound under the Terror, perhaps because so many other plays are prohibited or severely censured. After the Terror, for the last five years of the decade, the notion of good and bad revolutions is born, the Terror being in the latter category and seen as an aberration. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.559: informative chapters on the creation and evolution of genres (in particular, mixed genres, melodramas, and the like) -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.560: the ratio of comedies to tragedies performed was an astonishing 14 to 1 -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.560: We also learn, somewhat to our surprise, that theatergoers even in the darkest days of the Revolution "remained attached to the pre-Revolutionary repertory or that part of the new repertory that mimicked the old" (p. 90), although it must be said that very few indeed of the authors repertoried in the second part of the book are those canonized today. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561:  Racine's position in sixty-first place, with only 298 performances, corroborates the public's preference for comedy over tragedy; and "approved" playwrights of the Revolution also fare poorly: Marie-Joseph Chénier comes in sixty-ninth place, with a total of only 283 performances (sixty two of them for Charles IX), while Jean-Louis Laya's four plays had a mere sixty performances, of which L'Ami des Lois had only eighteen. It is clear that these authors would be even less discussed if earlier critics had had access to the kind of information contained in these pages. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561: very useful and thought-provoking charts showing the top ten plays by year -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561: A book like this can correct many misconceptions that we have of the theater in Paris during the Revolutionary era; it can lead us to understand more clearly than ever before what people actually wanted to see, and permit us to make reasonable conjectures about why. We can, on account of the mass of easily accessible data now available to us in one place, more fully appreciate what living the Revolution was like for the man (and woman) in the street. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018</Text>

            <Title>reparative reading</Title>
            <Text>The theoretical frameworks of this dissertation are drawn from the fields of feminist DH and queer DH, and from non-DH schools of thought which seem to offer valuable tools. My core motivating framework, as I conceptualize my work, is that of reparative reading. Eve Sedgwick’s “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading” persuasively describes in the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism, and attempts to sketch an alternative in what she terms reparative reading. A paranoid rhetoric of exposure and critique strikes me as the most obvious narrative to structure this dissertation’s investigation of the uneven institutional valuation of different writing. However, these obvious critiques also require rejecting many generations of sincere work by my fellow academics, without necessarily offering new discoveries of value to replace them. One experiment of this project, not yet complete, is to articulate an assessment of the limitations of contemporary digital resources which nonetheless allows those resources to be recuperated. My touchstones are two descriptions from Sedgwick’s original chapter:  
The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self. (149)
What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them. (150-151)
What Sedgwick describes, here, is a “desire,” not a methodology. I therefore understand “reparative reading” to refer, not to a precise set of practices, but to a position one might occupy in relation to a text. What I posit is also a desire: that my methods here can provide useful practices for others. The reparative position is a generous one, both in terms of giving of oneself to a text, and in terms of seeking a text’s strengths over its weaknesses. What I learn from Sedgwick, therefore, that attention is the first step toward caring, and that non-judgment can be more informative than rejection.</Text>

Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade, with some discussion of celebrity as it manifests in print culture. Chapter four turns its attention to the radical press, and the social ties underlying radical writing and publishing. A potential fifth chapter could explore the penetration of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode; I would be interested to see what percentage of works during the decade can be said to contain Gothic materials.</Text>

            <Title>Smith at U of T</Title>
            <Text>Searching the ESTC for records which both have “Toronto” in the library name and “Charlotte Turner” in the author name turns up two records: volume one of Rural Walks (1795) and Minor Morals (1798), both held at the Toronto public library. The Toronto Public Library catalogue has two distinct author identities for “Smith, Charlotte Turner, 1749-1806, author.” and for “Smith, Charlotte, 1749-1806,” and the special collections holdings only appear under the latter name (making them initially difficult to find). Under the “Smith, Charlotte” name, however, six titles printed during Smith’s appear: the two listed in ESTC, plus a complete two-volume copy of Rural Walks (1795), the first and second editions of Rambles Farther (1796 and 1800), and Conversations Introducing Poetry (1804). Of these, Rural Walks and both editions of Rambles Farther are listed in the ESTC but without records of the Toronto copies. All six titles are part of the Osborne Collection of Early Children's Books. This is interesting because it shows how scholarly disciplinary interpretations perpetuate themselves infrastructurally: as a Toronto-based scholar, the path is easier for me to study Smith-the-children’s-writer than other Smiths.</Text>

            <Text>I… think I am actually interested in the role of “celebrity” as related to authors, and the observation that too much / the wrong kind of celebrity during an author’s lifetime counteracts the potential for long-lasting literary fame
though, Radcliffe was also like Austen quite reclusive and resistant to the “celebrity author” role, even after she achieved financial literary success
but, that just meant that salacious stories of her Gothic madness &amp; death circulated unchallenged after she stopped writing and scholars are still trying to figure out what really did happen to her
hmm-- it ties into my general interest of trying to pick my way through my decade of choice, trying on a range of different metrics for “important” and then paying attention to the bodies of texts that come forward as “important” for each metric
and my diss authors (other than Radcliffe) are all attempting to use and cultivate literary fame as one of the ends of their writing
(well, even Radcliffe is cultivating fame, but with less directly political ends)

            <Text>“It has been difficult to consider playbills at scale because they were excluded from the catalogs that form the basis for mass digitization efforts. The absence of playbills from Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO), as well as from its pre-1700 counterpart Early English Books Online (EEBO), is a result of the decision, as reported by R. C. Alston, not to include them in the English Short Title Catalog (ESTC) on which those collections are built.” (Vareschi and Burkert 600 — citing R. C. Alston, “The Eighteenth-Century Non-Book: Observations on Printed Ephemera,” in The Book and the Book Trade in Eighteenth-Century Europe, ed. Giles Barber and Bernhard Fabian (Hamburg: Dr. Ernst Hauswedell &amp; Co., 1981), 343–60, quote on 344–45.)

“Alston recalls that the unusually high survival rate of playbills / actually worked against their inclusion in the ESTC during its creation in the 1970s. Often thought of as fragile in their ephemerality, playbills actually “seem to have been preserved more consistently than any other category of ephemera.”17 The compilers of the ESTC decided to catalog approximately 250,000 ephemeral materials like pam- phlets and ballads, but balked at including playbills, which would have added nearly 50,000 items from the British Library and the Victoria and Albert Museum alone.18 This decision has had serious ramifications for the study of British culture in the ensuing thirty years: ballads and pamphlets are now the basis of numerous serious studies by scholars in literature and history, while playbills are not.” (Vareschi and Burkert 600-601)
“Alston’s account reminds us that playbills are infrequently studied today because they were made less accessible and less institutionally supported than other kinds of items. While they once shared a visual field with the other cheaply printed materials of early modern London, such as libels and advertisements,20 today they are nearly invisible to scholars who can access those other cheap prints with the click of a button.” (Vareschi and Burkert 600-601)</Text>

Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what are now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.</Text>

As Johanna Drucker argues, “data” is not neutral/objective. As Safiya Noble and Wendy Chun demonstrate, algorithms are not neutral/objective. As Alberto Cairo shows, graphs and charts are not neutral/objective. Each of these is constructed, by humans, for human purposes, constrained by human biases. As the humanities have long known, of course, things need not be neutral/objective to be meaningful or valuable.

            <Title>Rigby, Mair, Queer Theory's Debt to the Gothic</Title>
            <Text>“Since the advent of academic queer theory in the early 1990s, the proliferation of publications addressing queer reading possibilities in Gothic fiction suggest that Queer Studies and Gothic Studies may be considered complementary fields of inquiry.” (46)
“But thinking about the queer theorisation of the Gothic only in terms of what queer theory has done for Gothic Studies might be a limiting way of approaching the subject. As Michael O’Rourke and David Collings have observed, it is not simply the case that the Gothic is always already queer; queer theory is also always already Gothic. … It is sometimes all too easy to view theory as illuminating literary texts and, in this essay, I will propose that the Gothic has had an equal, if note more important, in enabling the production of queer critical narratives.” (46)
“Judith Halberstam, for instance, now more well-known for her work on transgender politics, published her first book on Gothic horror fiction. George Haggerty publishes on both the Gothic and the history of sexuality, bringing these concerns together in Queer Gothic. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, sometimes called ‘the queen of queer theory’, also began her scholarly career in the Gothic.” (47)
“Haggerty goes so far as to argue that the Gothic ‘offers a historical model of queer theory and politics: transgressive, sexually coded and resistant to dominant ideology.’” (47)
“In these textual worlds of excess and danger we find the institutions of family and marriage shaken, the representation of extreme states of being, encounters with outcast monsters, not to mention conventional preoccupations with forbidden knowledge, paranoia, madness, secrecy, and guilt.” (47)
“What strikes me in the relationship between queer theory and Gothic fiction is precisely the uncannily personal sense of identification with the Gothic that often underscores work on the subject. Sigmund Freud suggested that the uncanny is ‘something which is secretly familiar… which has undergone repression and then returned from it.’ When I say that queer scholarship’s encounter with the Gothic is ‘uncanny’, I mean that it appears to be based on a sense of a ‘secret encounter’ in which the texts bring to light something which ought to be repressed, something that feels particularly pertinent to people whose identities, bodies, and desires have been culturally designated ‘queer’.” (48)
A truly lengthy survey of queer work enabled by the Gothic!
“Although the Italian and Udolpho are not fully-fledged lesbian Gothics, they can be placed in a tradition of Female Gothic texts that utilise the uncanny to speak about the construction of desire between women. I recognise something in these novels which impels me to speak about lesbianism. … All these texts deploy the motif of recognition between women to uncanny effect, indicating awareness that although lesbianism has been constructed under heteropatriarchy as something that must be repressed at all costs, the possibility of desire between women stubbornly returns to haunt the cultural centre. In this respect, the Female Gothic has also enabled lesbian theorists, such as Palmer and Castle, to produce subversive critical narratives which reclaim the Female Gothic for lesbian and queer theory.” (54)
“Instead of viewing queer theory as liberating repressed sexual meaning in the Gothic, is is interesting to view the Gothic as enabling queer scholarship, helping theorists to articulate queer reading practices and discuss the construction of sexual nonconformity.” (54)
“Underscoring much queer-Gothic scholarship, including this essay, is a feeling that people constructed as ‘queer’ have a special relationship with the uncanny and, therefore, with the Gothic. The impression that repressed queer meaning has come to light produces the uncanny sense of recognition in the feeling that Gothic texts are speaking about ‘us’. But perhaps what is demonstrated in the Gothic is the extent to / which the rhetorical construction of sex and gender nonconformity has been mediated through the uncanny, in which case, what we really recognise is our own construction as uncanny beings, bodies of knowledge that ought to be repressed.” (54-55)
“I began to feel, in other words, distinctly ‘uncanny’. At the time, I made no connections between my own experiences and my avid consumption of Gothic and horror novels. Queer theory has brought me full circle, enabling me to recognise that what I recognise in the Gothic is the Gothic’s capacity to convey an uncanny sense of queer awareness.” (55)</Text>

            <Text>Before delving into the more than fifty years of interlocking institutional histories which have created the current landscape of digital databases in eighteenth century studies, it is worth pausing to observe carefully what that current landscape actually looks like. One way to gain our bearings with an overwhelming quantity of information is to particularize it into anecdote: accordingly, our first look at these resources will be with the guiding figure of Charlotte Smith. Which works by Smith are in which database, why, and how? Another way to understand the pieces is to generalize them into systems: to take this approach, our second look at the same resources will examine graphs of their relative scale and overlapping contents. How does the system as a whole draw boundaries between its parts? Which parts are ‘peers’ or ‘colleagues,’ which are ‘rivals,’ and which do not even acknowledge their presence within the same system?</Text>

            <Text>So while the full.tsv contains records for works published as early as 1660 and as late as 1853, you can choose the 18c-full.tsv to look only at records published from 1700-1799, and the 19c-full.tsv for records with publication dates from 1800-1853.

About the Dataset
The Early Novels Dataset contains bibliographic metadata for early works of fiction held in the Collection of British and American Fiction, 1660-1830 (CBAF) at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, as well as other regional repositories. It consists of MARC catalog records enriched with custom subfields designed to offer new kinds of structured data about early fiction in English.

The END dataset is comprised of high-quality, human-generated metadata that captures a much fuller range of edition- and copy-specific information about early novels than traditional library catalog records. The END metadata schema builds on library-standard MARC records with custom-designed subfields that use both controlled and discursive vocabularies to describe a range of bibliographic features outside the scope of traditional cataloging. These include important bibliographic details such as authority statements, full and half title, accurate and controlled place of publication, and edition statement. They capture both copy-specific information about marginalia, inscriptions, and bookplates as well as title-level data on narrative form. And finally, they record the presence of important paratextual features like authors’ notes, epigraphs, footnotes, and indices, which can be found in many works of early fiction but have never been cataloged in a systematic way that would enable faceted search across a corpus.

As of September 2017, the complete Early Novels Dataset totals 2,041 records. The core eighteenth-century subset consists of 1,325 records, which represent all of Penn Libraries’ Collection of British and American Fiction holdings published from 1700-1794 and a sampling of holdings published from 1795-1799. A sample comparison of the CBAF holdings from the decade of the 1760s with all known fiction in English published during this period suggests that Penn's collection represents approximately 14% of this total corpus. In the core eighteenth-century subset, Penn's holdings are supplemented with selected holdings from other Philadelphia-area and regional repositories, including the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach, the Swarthmore Libraries Rare Book Room, Bryn Mawr College Special Collections, and New York University's Fales Library.

Pair END Data with Fulltext for Topic Modeling
While END’s primary focus is metadata, we are also in the preliminary stages of a fulltext initiative for the CBAF novels digitized by Penn Libraries and available through Print at Penn. We have created fulltext files for each of these texts using OCR; cleanup work is ongoing, both computationally and through hand-correcting. The fulltext is available in our digital-collection repostiory. We have also worked with Penn Libraries' Digital Humanities Specialist Scott Enderle to experiment with topic modeling of this fulltext combined with END metadata. Work-in-progress can be found in our earlynovels-topic-model repository, and Scott's enhanced Topic Modeling Tool, which enables pairing fulltext with metadata, can be found here.</Text>

            <Title>Murphy, Peter</Title>
            <Text>Abstract: “Peter Murphy’s book examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history, or poetry as an art. It focuses on five writers in the Romantic period: James MacPherson, Robert Burns, James Hogg, Walter Scott, and William Wordsworth. The first four are Scottish; the economic and linguistic status of Scotland during the period makes its writers especially interesting as examples of poetic ambition. Murphy’s study then crosses the border into England, offering a new perspective on Wordsworth’s poetic ambition and career. Murphy’s engagement throughout with the ballad revival fields fresh insights into some major concerns of the Romantic period: the interest in the primitive and the simple, experiments with poetic form, the problematics of loss, and the emergence of a new literary culture.” (Page i)

Introduction
“The fact that critics want to talk about Wordsworth more than they do MacPherson is a fact, and in what follows I try to deal with that fact.” (2)
“I try to specify the forces that work to produce the poetry that these writers write, and the forces that cause them to choose poetry writing as a job in the first place.” (3)
“That they choose poetry as a means of escaping into the world of higher life puts poetry in a most material and homely setting. Most of the poetry in these careers has the plainest of material purposes, and much the same status as any other thinga person might make and sell for a hopeful profit. By delineating with particularity the sorts of pressure that result in poetry in these lives, I hope to return poetry to the plain and everyday world of human motive and need, and in this sense this book is deeply historicist.” (3)
Burns couldn’t originally mix among the decorous classes. “Society is ruled by form, and poetry is too… Poetic propriety and ‘social’ propriety mix and become indistinguishable. For the ambitious, a poetic ‘mistake’ has exactly the same consequences as / a social mistake: the threat of failure, rejection by the world that the ambitious writer wishes to enter.” (3-4)
Evaluates people based on how much they exploit the oral northernness they sell - MacPherson the worst, Wordsworth and Scott both have integrity (4-5)
“In what follows I do not wish to recreate the poetic haven that Brooks gives us, but I try to acknowledge at all times that some poets are more capable than others, and that this fact must exert an important evaluation of the place and identity of poetry. To revocalize Brooks in a new key: if it is worth talking about poetry as a distinct form of culture, then we must talk about poetic success and failure. … If poetry as poetry exists in any meaningful form for us, we must find a way to tak about what makes poetry different from other forms of writing: we must talk about the life and energy of poetic form.” (7)

Chapter 1: James MacPherson
“MacPherson was once famous; he has now lapsed, and when we turn to him we must first raise him from oblivion. …quite probably he would not have cared about the lapse of his literary reputation. He died a famous and influential man, and, during much of his life, his primary activities and interests were not literary.” (9)
P. 31 - marketing of Ossian. “MacPherson can compliment Ossian’s poems so extravagantly because he claims to be merely a translator… The money, currency, accrues to MacPherson; the golden intregrity is added to Ossian’s account.” But I don’t see much discussion of how much money or from whom
“MacPherson was one of the greatest of Highland exporters, and the Ossian poems drew more attention to the Highlands than anything else, the rebellion of 1745 excepted” (36) — substantiated by a spike in tourism
“What sort of poetry is this, and what sort of poetic status can we give to James MacPherson? … The controversy and the curiously opaque fraud of the poems work in MacPherson’s favor, since he wants notice above all. He can’t lose: I have tried to show who does lose, but MacPherson cannot. His ambition is fulfilled with ruthless freedom, and as long as he is free he will simply ride the wind of the storm he raises. I would insist that his canonical death is justified, though, because he has committed a literary crime. He is a brilliant but utterly unpoetic poet. His contempt for form is a contempt for / real literary beauty, an the divine emptiness of Ossian’s poems is the result. He is a calculator, a poet for whom poetry is quite simply a possible road to success, and so he happily leaves literature behind… Especially after the reworked inspiration that the high romantic poets give to us, MacPherson’s motives, and what they produce, look appalling. I think we should insist on the ugliness of MacPherson’s poetry, but not on the ugliness of his motives. Such motives have produced more poetry than we often admit. Ambition is a human passion and partakes of human complexity. … Burns’ ambition matches that of MacPherson, and he creates a career for himself  in a very similar way, by retailing simplicity to the jaded sophisticate. But Burns was a poet, and he could not blind himself to the consequences of form. This sensitivity derails his career, and he dies romantically young and destitute; but he wrote some beautiful things.” (48)

I HATE THIS. Despite the rhetoric of being realistic and understanding about poetry as an occupation, it’s constantly drawing equivalences between commerciality and quality, and reinforcing the myth of the uncommercial beautiful genius.

Chapter 5: William Wordsworth
“Like Scott (and my other writers), Wordsworth was also profoundly interested in his readers, and profoundly interested in being a popular author. Wordsworth thought much more about success and failure than we tend to remember, and even though recen writing has taken / some notice of his interest in his readers we still remember the ‘fit audience’ of 1815 better than the anxously solicitous Wordsworth of the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads. Unlike Scott, though, Wordsworth’s methods resist popularity: he is constantly scolding and working on his reader, emphasizing moments of discomfort rather than passing them by.” (182-3)
“Poetic integrity does not, however, protect Wordsworth from becoming painfully frustrated by his lack of influence over his readers, as measured by their resistance to purchasing his books. Wordsworth wants to sell books: he wants people to read his books, be changed, and make him famous.” (183)
“For me and for Wordsworth, the proof is in the poetry” (187)
“‘Peter Bell’ s not a bad poem; it is a funny, wry poem, and a sincere poem too; it has more of the zany energies of the lyrics of 1798 than the staid proprieties of its published date, 1819. It is, however, a failed poem: it cannot fulfill its impossible desire of including the whole poetic world inside itself. It fails at the limits of poetry.” (194) It’s also an infamous commercial flop!!!
WW’s 1815 essay is the peak and the end of his obsession w popularity — expresses frustration, then formulates protective argument that greatness is unpopular (194-5). “There is a desperation about the whole argument, and no wonder, since one of its tasks is to prove Shakespeare unpopular.” (195)

Over the past twenty years, her life and work have received fresh attention from scholars and biographers who have become fascinated, as her contemporaries once were, with her dazzling personality, social prowess, thespian skill, and literary artistry. [2] Despite this resurgence in interest, however, relatively little is known about Robinson’s dramas, The Lucky Escape, a Comic Opera (Drury Lane, 1778; never published), Nobody (Drury Lane 1794; never published) and The Sicilian Lover: A Tragedy in Five Acts (never performed; published 1796). [3] Though they comprise an important component of Robinson’s histrionic and literary legacy, they have received less critical attention than her poems, essays, and novels, due in part to academic prejudices and to access issues: Romantic-period plays have traditionally received the short end of the canonical stick, so to speak, and, as a result, Robinson’s contributions to the genre have only ever existed, until just recently, in manuscript or rare book form. [4] Even in the face of these setbacks, Robinson’s dramas are worth investigating because they provide a key to understanding Romantic-period society, the late eighteenth-century stage, contemporary satire, the birth of celebrity culture, and Robinson’s engagement with the theater during and after her acting career, when she took on her new role as a woman of letters. [5]” (Robinson, n. pag.)</Text>

            <Title>Coker and Ozment</Title>
            <Text>Commenting on the potential impact of their enumerative bibliography of women in book history, Coker and Ozment say “bibliographic lists become the first step towards canon development, and from there to actual disciplinary creation" (6). 

“Gathering sources around an idea for which there is no critical consensus is a deeply ideological act that can influence how users will conceptualize the field moving forward. All of our subfield editorial choices are political, even more so than the explicit idea of a bibliography that is focused on women.” (Coker and Ozment 11)

“It is true that no database, including the WBHB, is perfect in its comprehensive surveillance of its intended topic, despite its best efforts. It is also true that the ways in which the MLA indexes sources inhibits visibility when it comes to English women and the book trades and authorship. The disparity between the WBHB and the MLA suggests a key difference in indexing practices. According to its online guidelines, the MLA employs a very broad vocabulary of 68,000 words used by a team of professional indexers and selected field bibliographers [FAQ n.d.]. The MLA also appears to not retroactively allow keywords to change (nor can we imagine many authors would find value in re-indexing dated scholarship). These are practical decisions, but they mean that listed sources do not always reflect how current scholarship is categorized and understood. Book history is an interdisciplinary field, so it is logical that authors and indexers may not always select the same terms that would link together studies that are truly on the same topics. Scholars may be participating in studies of book history implicitly rather than explicitly (as noted above), or pieces may have been published in an emerging discourse that now goes by another name. Since book history is a relatively new term for a broad and complicated field, it is not wholeheartedly embraced by its practitioners who may see the term as a needless derivative of historical bibliography, limited in its emphasis on the “book” as a printed codex, oddly fetishizing the material in an increasingly digital world, or less precise for a dozen other reasons. In short, what the field lacks is a set of values that is reflected in a lack of a centralized taxonomy.” (25)</Text>

            <Text>“Theory's suspension of the category of the literary, institutionalized as the inclusion of nonliterary works in its syllabus, might seem in a narrow sense more radical than a movement to open the canon to minority works that remain, after all, literary works" (176)
“the enormous significance of the /word/ 'theory,' as the unifying name of manifestly heterogenou critical practices." (177)
“deconstruction stands in a peculiarly representative or symptomatic relation to all theory” (178)
“what problem within the discipline of literary criticism becomes manifest as the symptomatology of the deManian ouevre” (179)
theory relies on "the charismatic persona of the master theorist"; theorists are seen as masters by the fact that they have disciples (179)
“By referring all language to rhetoric the literary critic can read anything, but in practice this has meant reading non-literary texts as literary“ (180)
“rhetoricism itself, the equation of literature with rhetoric, is the ideology of theory” (180)
“Althusser suggests that a symptomatic reading of a text reveals that the text provides an answer to a question which does not itself appear in the text.” (180)
de Man does ask “what is literature?” but the real question he answers (with “rhetoricism”) is "what shall replace literary criticism as it was formerly practiced, [ie] as the appreciative interpretation of the syllabus of 'literary’ works?” (180)
de Man framed his methodology as technically rigorous. conforming to new social norms of intellectual work as technobureaucratic (181)
“I will attempt to read this problem as the failure of de Manian theory (and theory in general) to function as anything other than an interim, imaginary solution to the new conditions of intellectual labor, conditions that will certainly require a thorough rethinking of what it is that literary critics do in the classroom and in their writing. In the meanwhile we can say that the reconstruction of criticism as a ‘technical' practice revealed the intrinsic inadequacy of the literary syllabus as the object of that intellectual labor; hence the ‘rigor' of theory had to be embodied not in literary works but in the philosophical or other nonliterary texts supplementing that syllabus. It is these works, the 'canon of theory,' which signify rigor." (181)
"If the institutional locus of canon formation is the school, and its instrumentality the syllabus, the social relation between teacher and student oddly effaces its institutional conditions in producing nothing less than a kind of love: first the love of the disciple for the master, and then the love for what the master teaches, his 'teaching,' and beyond that, as we shall see, a love for the very texts the master loves." (182)
"By transferring the eros of the transference to the lesson, the transference itself will disappear; it will be terminated. ... And this is to say that nothing will remain of de Man in the lesson, that loving the lesson is not, finally, the same as loving de Man." (185)
"The possible indistinction between religion and science is the achievement of psychoanalysis to have discovered, but at the (possible) cost of its own scientificity” (190)
de Man repurposes vocabulary of psychoanalysis for a linguistic reading (191)
de Man says that teaching is not an intersubjective relation, and there IS no intersubjective relation (192)
"What de Man gains tactically by reducing all intersubjective relations to the possibility of cognitive (that is, linguistic) error is the total obliteration of the transference from the terrain of the discussion." (193)
“The concept of error, then, as a linguistic concept, takes the place of the concept of the unconscious only by transferring an unconscious agency to language itself, in its privileged linguistic forms such as literature, rhetoric, or the text." (194)
“Lacan and de Man appear to set off resolutely on opposite theoretical directions, but ... they end up in the same place, the place of the ‘the subject who is supposed to know.’” (195)
"some account of what de Man means when he says that the 'resistance to theory’ which takes the form of  simple rejection of rhetorical reading is a ‘displaced symptom' of a reistance internal to the theoretical enterprise itelf. It is a displaced symptom of something the master actually encounters in his disciples, namely, /no resistance at all/, a boundless receptivity to the transmission of his doctrine as a positive knowledge." (197)
“‘it is not certain that there can be a science of literature' (RDR, 171). It is certain, however, that there can be  a  /discipline/ of literature." (198)
“Lacan expresses the problem of psychoanalytic theory's transmission as the thematic of the distinction between science and religion. What the theorist wants (but this is not yet equivalent to the 'desire of the analyst’) is the transmission of theory, that is, the solution to a problem in pedagogy. Whether or not a theory carries with it a claim to scientificity, its transmission would be better assured by its organization in the form of a science” (198)
“In the context of the pedagogic objective, discipleship is simply intstrumental (as Lacan says) and no transference which took as its final object the person of the master theorist would be adequate to the task of transmission" (198)
“Transference transferred is the form of transference /in general/. How would this transference, formally speaking, be different from the transmission of a science? We are forced to conclude that it would not, that the desire for one's works to be received as a science is not distinguishable from the desire for discipleship, for the /form/ of a church.” (198)
distressing when disciples get it wrong, but also when they get it /exactly/ right
”the self-discipline of the disciples, the mechanism by which theory is reproduced with an exactitude which then becomes the object of the master's ambivalent fixation" (199)
“If one nevertheless finds the examples quoted above unusual in their imitative precision..." -- I do not; I don't even see a lot of connection. (200)
“in pedagogy no dissolution of the transference occurs” (200) -- I think this is Guillory's idea
the point “is not that de Manian discipleship is anomalous for permanently fixing the transference, but that pedagogy itself is a social relation constituted by a transference which tends toward permanent fixation. ... The transferrence in pedagogy is least likely to be dissolved when the thought is transmitted in the ‘impersonal' form of a science.” (201)
disciples follow de Man's technique fundamentally by imitating his style -- that's what makes it ‘teachable, generalizable, and highly responsive to systematization’ (201)
"the transference onto theory always misses its object, the positive content of theory, by cathecting in and behind that object the image of the master.” (201)
Lacan's matheme: “By reducing transmission to a rote process the doctrine was supposed to escape a certain contingency of the transference, its constitutive ambivalence, its love-hate. But the reception of the matheme marked a greater investment in the transference than ever before, even as both master and disciple deferred to the impersonal form of the algorithm.” (202)
“the teaching of both de Man and Lacan attempts to account and compensate for the vicissitudes of transmission by attributing those vicissitudes to an epistemological defect of language, or by refusing in principle the possibility of the dissolution of the transference. The two positions amount in practice to the same thing." (202)
“what unifies the syllabus which includes (among others) Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, or Nietzche, Freud, Saussure, and Heidegger, is the fact that these oeuvres can be taken to embody a discourse of mastery, which is always by definition an imitable discourse." (203)
“The names which circulate as ‘theory' in this canonical sense are actually very few in number, much more restricted a list than that which constitutes ‘canonical' literary work. Furthermore the very canonical organization of these texts, their recategorization as 'theory', has the effect of neutralizing the generic, disciplinary, and ideological differences between them in much the same way that the literary canon tends to define all canonical literary texts as the embodiment of a single quality of 'literariness’.” (203)
"The larger question, for which I shall attempt to provide a properly sociological analysis in the latter part of this chapter, is why the literary critical profession should now require a canon which signifies in its totality a discourse of mastery, in addition to the traditional 'literary' canon, whose significance, as we shall see, is considerably altered by its interrelation with the theory-canon." (203)
the works which get studied are in fact chosen because the great masters LIKE them, personally -- but we don't say that's why (204)
“a contempt for the very discipleship which is the mechanism of theory's transmission... is inevitably cultivated by the master theorists, as the inevitable accompaniment to the cultivation of disciples” (205)
de Man's "terminology produces certain discursive effects. These effects are (1) the conflation of linguistics with rhetoric; (2) the equation of literature with rhetoric; and (3) the reduction of rhetoric to trope." (208)
1. The conflation of linguistics with rhetoric (209)
de Man defines literary language: “literariness, the use of language that foregrounds the rhetorical over the grammatical and the logical function" (210)
2. The equation of literature with rhetoric (212)
rhetoric and literariness have to be historically defined, not theorized universally, though de Man says otherwise (213)
“What is at stake in the noncoincidene of literature and rhetoric is the historical relation between them.” (213)
"The identification of literature with rhetoric is conditional upon the appearance of the category of ‘literature' in the later eighteenth century as a set of genres both segregated from, and elevated above, the general field of writing.” (213)
we now do Fielding in lit and Hume in philosophy "a categorization that would have been exactly reversed earlier in the eighteenth century, when Hume had a distinguished literary career and Fielding could be dismissed as a mere writer of 'novels’.” (213) -- so, not EXACTLY reversed, bc Fielding wouldn't be in philosophy
end result of Early Modern concept of scientific truth creates the idea of "fiction”; in 18thC ”the category of the 'literary' could then be restricted to the fictional genres. The new generic system had to develop a conception of truth proper to its form and the theorization of this truth describes in the largest sense the project of 'Romantic' criticism" (214)
“To be sure, we are always prepared for another rehearsal of the quarrel between poetry and philosophy ... but it remains a historically determinate fact that, for us, the question of this relation can only be posed /after science/." (214)
“it is by means of a return to rhetoric that the generic distinction between literary and non-literary texts can be reconceptualized as a linguistic distinction, the problem of 'literary language’” (214)
de Man's theory has a gaping hole re: what it can study, but because students can just fall back on studying the fixed syllabus he has used of a relatively fixed and institutionally normal set of texts, "the discrepancy between its stability and its theoretical groundlessness need never be examined” (216)
de Man’s privileged tropes are metaphor and metonymy (221)
de Man's reading detaches the names of tropes (metaphor, metonymy) “from their conventional significations in rhetoric” (226)
de Man's reading is thematic; the use of 'tropes’  "permit the methodology to advertise itself as rigorously rhetorical or non-thematic” (227)
for de Man “metaphor and metonymy mean necessity and chance” (227)
In valuing chance over necessity/identity/totality, "What is at stake, always, is the locus of agency, or the illusion of the determination of language by an autonomous subject or person." (228)
“Shall we now say that the thematic of chance and necessity has led de Man to a version of /materialism/?” this is how his disciples have interpreted it (228)
“while the project of theory was to produce such a thematic sublation of literature, this project could be accomplished only by supplementing the literary canon with another set of texts whose function was to reflect precisely the identity of literature." (230)
section: "De Rigeur, or the Charisma of Routinization" (231)
people want "the artficialist illusion that the Work of Schooling could escape bearing the mark of the institutional conditions of its exercise. All school culture is necessarily standardized and ritualized, i.e., ‘routinized' by and for the routine of the Work of Schooling” (Bourdiew and Passeron, /Reproduction/, qtd in Guillory 231)
rhetorical reading gets its rigor from its ability to produce readings that the reader doesn't want -- but "Let us consider the possibility that nothing is more desirable than that the conclusion of the reading be known in advance" (231)
“The rigor of rhetorical reading is not by any means the rigor of an argument in which the knowledge produced at its conclusion can actually take the reader by surprise." (232)
“The rigor of rhetorical reading is thus more rigor than a science requires: it is the rigor of a prescience, a foreknowledge.” (232)
de Man "will praise the work of a disciple as ‘technical rather than aesthetically pleasing’ (CW, 121), by which he means that it achieves the condition of rigor” - relying on a contemporary ideal of 'techne' as science rather than its classical definition as art (232)
"I shall be attempting to locate the political effects of deconstruction initially in the conditions of intellectual work, the labor specific to the literary academic. It is in the latter context that the fetishization of ‘rigor' has particular force, where rigor signifies less the fatedness of human beings in general as it does the nature of the intellectual work of theory." (233)
there are places where de Man has to 'force' his reading; these coincide with “the appearance of lurid figuration, and such proximity raises questions about the rigorousness of rigor; for what if the trajectory were being determined by the effect of pathos itself-- that is, a /narrative/ effect-- and not by the argument's unassailable logic” (235)
"As rhetorical reading's most overdetermined concept, rigor facilitates an imaginary reduction of the social totality to the structure of the trope, and it thus permits rhetorical reading to function as a political theory just by virtue of being no more than a theory of literature." (236)
“If de Manian deconstruction authorizes no specific political practice, as its critics have been eager to claim, that is beside the point. We should do better to ask why a theory of literature (much less of trope) should imply a political practice." (236)
deconstruction responded to an external demand (that the syllabus serve a political purpose) "by imposing a limit to curricular revision, a limit intended to preserve theory as literary theory." (237)
“that ethos is irrelevant to the situation of American academics, for whom Marxism has not been a /political/ force in many decades.” (240). burn!
American universities are more marginalized in the culture than European ones; graduate study in America is not about real politics but the politics of the profession -- grad students will be profs, not go on to other jobs (241)
“Deconstruction is always and from the first ‘institutionalized,' as it has no other locus of practice, dissemination, or resistance than university literature departments. Nevertheless the motif of 'institutionalization' has large discursive effects because it allows deconstruction to occupy, at the moment of its origin, an imaginary locus /exterior/ to the institution." (242)
discussing politics “by addressing directly the institutional dilemma of deconstruction -- not resistance but discipleship (transference-resistance), and the routinization effects at once produced and lamented by the disciples. This is t say that what theory responds to is not immediately politics, but the conditions of institutional life, the everyday life of the professors of literature." (245)
“de Man's argument is that departments of literature have denied their institutional identity as departments; they have constructed an institutional self-image which devalues their own purely institutional functions. Against such institutionalized anti-institutionalism de Man proposes a thorough reinvestment in the form of the department, as the basic structural unit of the university.” which means no longer being 'large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter' but instead ‘much smaller units, dedicated to.. professional specialization’ (247)
“professionalism names an ideological discourse, the ego-ideal of the professoriate, and not simply an institutional practice." (247)
Weber makes charisma and bureaucracy “the historical and structural antipodes of his sociology” (248)
"According to this formulation, it should be impossible for charismatic authority to appear within bureaucratic institutions at all. Truly bureaucratic authority dissolves charisma and replaces it with a cathexis of the office rather than the person” (248)
he's setting up to produce an analysis of bureaucracy (250)
“the degree of bureaucratization, or what I will call ‘heteronomy’—the degree to which one's work is prescribed by superiors in the bureaucratic hierarchy—exists in a certain ratio to the degree of 'professional activity,' a realm of more autonomous behavior, defined for teachers both by the privacy of the classroom and by academic freedom of discourse among colleagues in a field" (251)
“acknowledging the overdetermination of the concept of 'autonomy' in the contemporary school by the complex interaction of the two relative autonomies, the pedagogic and the bureaucratic”
"the charisma of the master theorists could be translated into bureaucratic prestige" (255)
“the institutional position of the master theorist, as the person in whom institutional and personal prestige is ‘blended,’ and in whom the concept of 'autonomy' is maximally overdetermined, was always a condition for the emergence of theory.” (155)
“The increasingly technobureaucratic organization of the professional field of literary criticism was a condition for the emergence of theory, which we can understand in retrospect as the reassertion of charismatic authority in the face of that technobureaucratic domination." (256)
"Within the larger discourse of 'theory,' rhetorical reading has the important symptomatic function of figuring a  rapprochement with the institutional conditions of criticism, by acknowledging the loss of intellectual autonomy as a theory of linguistic determinism -- at the same time that autonomy is continually reinvested in the figure of the master theorist. But this is an autonomy which exists only on the imaginary /outside/ of the institution, as an 'anti-institutional' charisma.” (259)
theory introduces to grad pedagogy "a syllabus whose symptomatic function is to signify precisely methodological 'rigor,' rather than the taste or discrimination which for so long determined the ideological protocols of literary criticism.” (260)
theory has become “work on a set of problems that concern all critics” (26), working on "the problem of 'specialization,' or the effects of the technobureaucratic organization of labor on the discipline of criticism" (261)
grad seminars offer unique freedom for theory to appear, but “The indifference of university administrators to the graduate curriculum reflects less their respect for the traditional autonomy of the graduate teacher as it does an accurate estimation of the diminished significance of the literary curriculum in the context of the university’s perceived social function, the perceived demand for the knowledges it disseminates." (261)
“the hegemony of that technobureaucratic organization of intellectual life which has rendered the literary curriculum socially marginal by transforming the university into the institution designed to produce a new class of technical/managerial specialists possessed of purely technical/managerial knowledge." (261)
struggles to identify a 'rationale' for literary study that would produce a syllabus of literary works (262)
schools used to be tasked with "the impossible task of at once democratizing the distribution of knowledges and maintaining class distinctions" but now "the nation-state…no longer requires that a distinctive practice of … language identify a culturally homogenous bourgeoisie. That class has long since been replaced by a culturally heterogenous New Class” (263)
“it is the absence of such a crucial social function which the professors of literature experience as powerlessness in the face of a political entity--the state--which they misrecognize as the source of disempowerment." (263)
“It is not yet clear whether a 'cultural studies' curriculum has been conceived which does not replicate the theoretical and hermeneutic paradigms of literary interpretation.” (265)
“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)

“1n the argument to follow, I will be using the term "symptomatic" in the specific sense developed by Althusser in Reading Capital, trans. Ben Brewster (London: Verso, 1970),28. For a somewhat different use of Althusser's technique of symp- tomatic reading to interpret de Man's oeuvre, see Ellen Rooney's Seductive Reasoning: Pluralism as the Problematic of Contemporary Literary Theory (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1989). Rooney very persuasively demonstrates the fact that pluralism is a problematic which underlies much critical theory, even theories which appear to contradict each other. She finds in de Man another version of the problematic of "general persuasion" which posits "a homogeneous commu- nity of readers" (161). While I would agree that de Man shares certain pluralist assumptions with much other contemporary criticism, I have attempted to discern in this chapter a problematic which is more specific to the project of deconstructive theory in its symptomatic relation to the institutionalized theory syllabus.” (371)
“I use the terms "deconstruction" and "rhetorical reading" interchangeably, de- spite the fact that the former term is attached equally to the work of Jacques Derrida. In making this terminological choice I mean to draw explicit attention to the problematic conflation of rhetorical reading with the concept of deconstruction in general usage. While the term "deconstruction" encloses the work of de Man and Derrida within a set of generalized theoretical motifs and procedures, it does so only in the practice of literary criticism. This fact has ensured the consequence that Derridean philosophy is largely transmitted to literary critics through the lens of his reception in the immediate context of de Man's critical writing. It is through de Man's work that the term deconstruction is disseminated, as the name of a school of criticism; in the preface to Allegories of Reading, he remarks that he "first came across" the term in Derrida's writing. On the question of the differences between de Manian and Derridean deconstruction, it is customary to defer to Rodolph Gasche's scrupulous appraisal, "Deconstruction as Criticism," in Glyph 6 (Bal- timore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979). I would of course agree with Gas- / che that there are crucial differences between the respective projects of de Man and Derrida which need to be, so to speak, "reiterated." But where does that leave the term "deconstruction"? It is my supposition that there is very little "deconstruc- tive" criticism which is not capable of being regarded as a version of "rhetorical reading. " To this point we may add a reiteration of the differences, first by de Man, then by Derrida. From The Resistance to Theory: "In some cases, a direct link may exist between philosophy and literary theory. More frequently, however, contem- porary literary theory is a relatively autonomous version of questions that also sur- face, in a different context, in philosophy, though not necessarily in a clearer and more rigorous form" (RT, 8). And from the Afterword to Limited Inc: "But it may be permissible to underscore that I have never assimilated or reduced, as is often said, concept to metaphor. . . . Instead, I have sought to deconstruct the concept of metaphor itself and proposed an entirely different 'logic,' 'a new articulation' of the relations between concept and metaphor, which is to say, also, between philosophy, science, logic on the one hand, and rhetoric on the other. Deconstruction, as I have practiced it, has always been foreign to rhetoricism-which, as its name indicates, can become another form of logocentrism-and this despite or rather because of the interest I have felt obliged to direct at questions of language and at figures of rhetoric. What is all too quickly forgotten is often what is most massively evident, to wit, that deconstruction, that at least to which I refer, begins by deconstructing logocentrism, and hence also that which rhetoricism might owe to it" (Limited Inc [Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1988], 156).” (371-372)
“8Fredric Jameson seems to me entirely correct in remarking that "De Man was an eighteenth-century mechanical materialist, and much that strikes the postcon- temporary reader as peculiar and idiosyncratic about his work will be clarified by juxtaposition with the cultural politics of the great Enlightenment philosophes." Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic o f Late Capitalism (Durham: Duke Univer- sity Press, 1991), 246. I would qualify this statement only by deemphasizing the idiosyncracy of this materialism, and arguing for the symptomatic generality of the- oretical notions such as the "materiality of the letter. " (374)
“For a rather different analysis of the kind of "work" that goes on in English departments, see Evan Watkins, Work Time: English Departments and the Circulation of Cultural Value (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1989). Watkins emphasizes the function of the "evaluation" of students in his analysis rather than, as I have, the process of credentialization in linguistic or other knowledges.” (375)
“57fhe only critic I have encountered who has remarked on the "cathexis" of boredom in the practice of rhetorical reading is D. A. Miller, who detects and ex- poses such a cathexis in J. Hillis Miller's citation of precisely this passage from de Man's work. See "The Profession of English: An Exchange," J. Hillis Miller and D. A. Miller, ADE Bulletin 88 (1987),42-58.” (377)
“1t seems evident in retrospect that deconstruction's solution to the problem of autonomy has been displaced in recent years by a more openly professionalist dis- course that vehemently reasserts professional autonomy by celebrating precisely the "blending of personal and organizational prestige." Such an ideology of profes- sionalism once again represses the bureaucratic determination of professional activ- ity, though it is no less troubled by the omnipresence of such heteronomy; it wishes rather to play the game well, "pragmatically." Most importantly it no longer needs to project its solution to the problem of work autonomy onto a theory of reading. Indeed, the versions of pragmatism and relativism now circulating in the wake of theory can display a relaxed disdain for theory's "rigor," as that term signifies a kind of prior restraint upon professional activity. In that sense pragmatism is the theory of which professionalism is the practice.” (377)
“3Raymond Williams has always argued forcefully for maintaining a sense of the historical interrelation between High and Low Cultural works. See his comment in "The Future of Cultural Studies," in The Politics ofModernism: Against the New Conformists (London: Verso, 1989): "It is necessary and wholly intellectually de- fensible to analyse serials and soap operas. Yet I do wonder about the courses where at least the teachers-and I would say also the students-have not themselves en- countered the problems of the whole development of naturalist and realist drama, of social-problem drama, or of certain kinds of serial form in the nineteenth cen- tury, which are elements in the constitution of these precise contemporary forms, so that the tension between that social history of forms and these forms in a contem- porary situation, with their partly new and partly old content, partly new and partly old techniques, can be explored with weight on both sides" (159).” (378)

            <Title>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993</Title>
            <Text>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993) goes furthest in investigating the cultural and political significance of the also very neglected gothic plays – a ‘popular literary mode’ in the 1780s and a ‘mania’ in the 1790s (149). In Backscheider’s analysis these plays were easily applicable to the politics of the 1790s, over and over again depicting villainous aristocrats violating the sanctity of life, liberty, property and female chastity, and powerful crowds able to overthrow them. But, she quickly adds, ‘Year by year, the plays show stronger and stronger strategies of containment’ (226). They characterise mob-rule as being just as inimical as despotism, and they represent the virtuous and legitimate protagonists as able to conquer abuses and restore order though non-confrontational means. Ultimately then, the plays ‘propagated a comforting vision of community, of human nature, and of a providential, benignly ordered world’ (232). More powerfully still, they provided a safety valve for a nervous and agitated public: 
By acting out repressed anxieties and hopes in overt and symbolic representations, the plays released tensions and made social contradictions momentarily innocuous. Social antagonism became opportunities to demonstrate the idealized British self-image and to confirm that no revolution was needed in their country . . . The aristocrats could be restrained and the poor would be taken care of . . . Conflict became spectacle, a containable and consumable product. (233)

            <Text>Chapter 3 of this dissertation examines the works of Mary Robinson across several digital corpora. Mary Robinson is selected as a contemporary of Charlotte Smith’s with remarkably similar patterns of publication, but remarkably different reception. Mary Robinson’s first literary foray was the volume Poems by Mrs. Robinson, published by C. Parker in 1775, shortly followed by the poem Elegiac verses to a young lady on the death of her brother. “Though Poems received little critical support, and made little money, Mary Robinson continued to write” (Mark Ockerbloom), but she would begin her career as an actress before this writing saw publication. Robinson’s theatrical debut as Juliet in December 1776 led to an increasingly acclaimed and prolific acting career. In 1777 she published a volume of works written earlier, Captivity, A Poem: and Celadon and Lydia, A Tale, and in 1778 she wrote and starred in her own musical farce, The Lucky Escape, from which she published The Songs, Chorusses, etc. In 1780, Robinson retired from the stage. The next volume under her name did not appear until 1791, but the intervening decade was not empty of literary activity. From 1784 to its publication in 1787, Robinson collaborated with Banastre Tarleton on the composition and revision of his History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781. In 1788, Robinson began the writing which would make her career as an author. She contributed poems to The World and The Oracle under the pseudonyms “Laura” and “Laura Maria” which responded to popular poems by a coterie of writers now called the Della Cruscans, who addressed each other in periodicals with Miltonic, Italianate, and political poetry. Robinson’s poems successfully inserted herself into their conversation, prompting replies from the other poets. This dissertation’s decade of interest, 1789-99, captures Robinson’s most prolific period. Her 1790 poem Ainsi va le Monde, published under the pseudonym Laura Maria, was her breakout Della Cruscan poem. The success of her Della Cruscan poetry led to the publication in 1791 of another Poems by Mrs. Robinson, this time by J. Bell, as well as The Beauties of Mrs. Robinson, another collection of poetry. She also produced a pamphlet that year, Impartial Reflections on the Queen of France, under the name “a friend to humanity”. The next year, 1792, saw the arrival of a successful novel, Vancenza, or the Dangers of Credulity, which went through three editions in that year, and two elegiac poems. 1793 saw three more poems, two under her own name and one under the pseudonym “Horace Juvenal.” In 1794 she published her second novel, The Widow, or a Picture of Modern Times. In 1795 she published another novel, Audley Fortescue, under the name “Mr. Robinson.” In 1796 she published four major works: the novel Angelina; the novel Hubert de Sevrac; a sonnet series Sappho and Phaon; and the play The Sicilian Lover. The next year, 1797, saw two more novels: Julie St. Lawrence and Walsingham. 1798 was Robinson’s first year since 1790 with no publications, but in 1799, she perhaps made up for it by publishing two novels, The False Friend and The Natural Daughter, as well as a political treatise, A Letter to the Women of England on the Cruelties of Mental Subordination. She also began contributing weekly essays to the Morning Post and Gazetteer in 1799. After 1799 (and thus after this dissertation’s decade of interest), Robinson’s career and life is short. In 1800, she published her tenth novel, Ellinda; her verse collection Lyrical Tales in volume form as well as The Mistletoe, a Christmas Tale (as Laura Maria) in its own small book; and a translation from the German of Joseph Hager’s travel narrative A Picture of Palermo. Robinson died in December 1800. After her death, her daughter Mary Elizabeth Robinson oversaw the posthumous publication of three more works: Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself (1801), a collection of poetry titled The Wild Wreath (1804), and a final collection of The Poetical Works of the Late Mrs. Robinson (1806).</Text>

            <Text>What do these database histories mean for scholars of eighteenth century literature? First and foremost, these histories provide another reminder that these things do not exist prior to interpretation or intervention. It is not merely that they are shaped or influenced by their institutional contexts, implying small quirks or edge cases which can generally be ignored: they are constituted in the first place by those institutional contexts. Secondly, these histories suggest a course of action to be taken in response to the specific institutional factors constituting each database. Scholars periodically acknowledge the gaps between historical events as they occurred and the specific archive, database, or corpus that they are using as a proxy for the idealized concept of “the historical record,” but these acknowledgements typically take the form of a statement that some form of bias is assumed to exist, but that this bias is so unknowable and unavoidable that naturally we will just continue onward as if it was not present. Identifying the specific institutional process that led to the current digital infrastructure undermines efforts to brush off these details as unknowable: directly investigating the actual demographics of each resource’s holdings, as I do in future chapters, can also render these biases no longer unavoidable.</Text>

            <Text>“The shift from conventional parable to a more ambitious fictional synthesis of the whole machinery of moral reform involves More in a complex and frankly promotional set of references to her own activity.” (497)

“This glimpse into the contractual foundations of a political economy of charitable relief vividly confirms Dorice Elliott’s argument that More treated charity as a form of exchange, in which the female philanthropic benefactor acquires ‘the right and responsibility . . . to superintend those she relieves.’” (497)

To be clear, my point is not that we should substitute More for Burke as the avatar of reaction in Britain; the cultural field is too uneven to be represented by any single writer or activist. Yet More’s career does usefully shift our attention away from the twin poles of a reconstructed debate (Burke/Paine), which never really occurred in the way we tend to imagine, and towards a set of literary texts, whose remarkable conditions of production suggest not abstract ideological positions but the social and cultural conditions under which political expres- sion and persuasion actually took place.16 As More herself observed, the French Revolution occurred at a time when “an appetite for reading had, from a variety of causes, been increased among the inferior ranks in this country,” and the Cheap Repository was designed “to supply such wholesome aliment as might give a new direction to their taste, and abate their relish for . . . corrupt and inflammatory publications” (5:vii–viii). If, for Romanticist readers, the language of this passage brings to mind William Wordsworth’s 1800 preface to Lyrical Ballads, where voracious reading habits and revolutionary upheaval also threaten “the present state of the public taste in this country,” this unexpected intersection of two very different literary careers should encourage us to reconsider the Cheap Repository as the most institutionally ambitious, and arguably the most influential, of the many Romantic-period efforts to create the taste by which a new literature was to be enjoyed.17 (502)</Text>

            <Text>History of vernacular literature entering schools
	•	“the impetus behind the / standardization of speech does not come from the landed nobility but from a much wider and more heterogeneous group, which is beginning to recognize itself not as other than aristocratic but as part of a society of ‘gentlemen,’ defined according to norms of behavior and education rather than blood” (98)
	•	"The fact of increased upward mobility is at once the premise of ‘bourgeois ideology' -- that anyone can succeed -- and its prime source of social anxiety. … there must be neither too little nor too much social mobility.” (95)
	⁃	"Historians are now inclined to emphasize a disparity between the perception of up- ward mobility and the actual rate at which this mobility occurred. … Setting aside the question of whether this use of statistics is not intended to confound the very possibility of a class analysis, one may at least argue that the perception of upward mobility, which was ubiquitous and even hysterical in the eighteenth century, is a real event with real historical consequences.” (363)
	•	“since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless’ knowledge comes to stand… as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent." (96-97) "This ambivalence... is ultimately resolved with the entry of vernacular literature into the new, middle-class schools. The study of vernacular literature is thus at first a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97)
	•	“Just as the late medieval nobility acquired literacy but did not care to master the scholastic canon of the clergy, the middling sort wished to acquire polite speech but not necessarily a knowledge of Latin or Greek." (100)
	•	"The anxiety expressed by Sheridan is that, in the absence of an institutional form of dissemination, literary culture cannot be entrusted to preserve English works of the past; vernacular works must be revalued as equal in value to classical works and therefore worthy to be taught in the schools. This is the crucial point: the judgment of vernacular works throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries already elevates some works over others, but only the institutionalization of these works as a curriculum can revalue their cultural capital as the equal of the classics.” (101)

Merging of poetry and prose
	•	18thC prose, unlike Renaissance prose, eschewed "neologism, archaism, complex figuration, and foreign borrowing,” defined itself as being "a normalized language” (121) -- raising the stakes of prose and poetry merging
	•	elision of poetry and prose puts entire English canon in question, since "in the two previous centuries, all literature was poetry and only poetry was literature" (121)

Serious vs popular is the new high vs low
	•	the distinction between 'serious' prose and 'popular' prose is a new form of the high/low culture schism, because unlike poems vs ballads, the forms of prose are the same form (131)
	⁃	“When the successful dissemination of the standard permits production in genres which have no canonical authorization, but which are nevertheless unimpeachable vehicles of polite speech, a canonical crisis arises in the form of an anxious discrimination of ‘serious’ from ‘popular’ writing.” (132)
	•	“canonical /forms/, the categories of textual appropriation and reproduction in their institutional sites, operate as mechanisms of selection before individuals exercise judgments, of whatever kind." (123)
	•	Wordsworth, like Gray, presents “the socially distinct character of the poet threatened with effacement of obscurity in the very identification of his language with the language of the rustics” -- fear of failure of social distinction (128)

The school makes the canonical distinction
	•	what now distinguishes "serious" literature from “popular" literature is its penetration into the school system: reserving a work until higher in the school hierarchy is what grants it higher status (133)
	⁃	“As the school becomes the exclusive agent for the dissemination of High Canonical works, replacing the quasi-educational institutions, the coffeehouses, literary clubs, and salons of eighteenth-century literacy—the realm of the bourgeois public sphere—the prestige of literary works as cultural capital is assessed according to the limit of their dissemination, their relative exclusivity.” (133)
	•	the school "as the site at which social mobility is choked off" (95) -- the poor should be actively deprived of education in order to minimize too much mobility
	•	“the distinction between serious and popular genres produces no corresponding linguistic differentiation within the reading public.” (133)
	⁃	“The division of literary production into ‘literature’ and the genres which are by definition subliterary or nonliterary does eventually produce a corresponding linguistic distinction when genres are distributed by the curricula of the educational system in order to separate them out according to the levels of the system” (133)

Implications for the concept of ‘literary language’
“When a finite set of genres becomes the supergenre of ‘literature,’ all canonical works can be regarded as exemplifying a language essentially different from the language spoken by ‘real men,’ namely, ‘literary language.’ But from the vantage of the longue dureé, ‘literary language’ is nothing other than the successor to poetic diction, the reduction of all literature to a written language which produces a difference in speech, a social distinction, among those who have access to this second language through the schools. … The fact that it is still possible to speak of the intrinsic difference between literary language and ordinary language is a measure of how successfully the conservators of literature have erased its origins even in the act of writing its history.” (Guillory 132-133)


Gray’s Elegy
	•	“the proposition that the noble makes a better peasant than a peasant. ... The poem does not really address the peasantry. While the noble habitus can be represented by the imperturbably and natural nobility of literary peasants, these peasants cannot at the same time be represented as miserably impoverished. The peasants, in other words, cannot be both literary and real peasants.” (113)
	•	“The hypothetical achievements of the peasantry can be represented in the poem as at once tragically repressed; but on the other hand, no achievements are named in the poem which are not deplored as instances of Ambition, Luxury, and pride: hence Milton is flanked by Hampden and Cromwell.” (112)
	•	“Gray's landscape contains no historical social institutions, no historical aristocrats or peasants, and that is just the point of it. It is a landscape of abstract repression: ‘Penury' represses 'rage’.” -- this contrasts with Barbauld critiquing laws that blocked Dissenters from schools. (106)
	•	the lack of class mobility is “stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it. ... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that the man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities. ... Many people, without being communists, have been irritated by the complacence in the massive calm of the poem, and this seems partly because they feel there is a cheat in the implied politics” (Empson 4-5, qtd in Guillory 94)
	•	“impression of an immediate but sophisticated accessibility” -- a sense that it is all made up of familiar poetic phrases — due to the 'commonplace book’  (87)
	•	"The affect of complacence is produced... by the relation of the commonplace... to the ‘universality and impersonality’ of the style. I would like to propose that this style is produced by the systematic linguistic normalization of quotation … The cento of quotable quotations which is the poem thus generates a reception-scenario characterized by the reader's pleased recognition that 'this is my truth,' while at the same time concealing the fact that this pleasure is founded on the subliminal recognition that 'this is my language.’” (92)
	•	“The Elegy is thus at once peculiarly accessible to a wide reading public at the same time that its narrative reinscribes this access as innate rather than acquired. ... The cultural entitlement that for Gray is defined by classical literacy, by his immense learning, is thus acquired by his readers at a discount, at the cost only of acquiring the vernacular literacy requisite to reading the poem." (121)

Barbauld’s poem
	•	“Gray's poem... is followed by a poem enitled ‘Warrington Academy,' by one 'Mrs. Barbauld,' a writer no one would regard today as canonical. The adjacency of so titled a poem to Gray's call attention either to itself or to Gray, or to both." (103) No -- I don't think it CALLS attention to anything, though it might REWARD attention. Also weird that he dismisses Barbauld as if I've never heard of her, even though I totally have; she's still in the anthologies. I guess the feminists put her back in the 90s?
	•	"Barbauld was very much in the vanguard, then, of that anthologizing movement by which English literature was given a canonical form. In this context the pendant position of ‘Warrington Academy' in relation to Gray's poem is, as we may now demonstrate, not at all accidental: Barbauld's poem reads Gray's /Elegy/ and so enacts its reception.” (104) DISAGREE - could be completely accidental, or placed because it, too, describes a place.
	•	“Behind the generic veil certain social facts come sharply into focus: the struggle of individuals and social groups to rise. Gray's peasants of course do not struggle. Barbauld's word for the social fact she firmly grasps is "emulation,” which here has all of the senses to which I have assigned it, preeminently ‘to compete by imitiation.’" (104)
	•	“The important point here is that the opening lines express the fact of struggle through a rhetoric of literary culture; that culture is where the struggle takes place.” (104)
	•	“The significance of middle-class women in this movement has been recently stressed by Nancy Armstrong, "Literature as Women's History," Genre 19 (Winter 1986),367: "Today few of us realize that many features of our standard humanities curriculum came from a curriculum designed specifically for educating polite young women who were not of the ruling class, or that the teaching of native British literature developed as a means of socializing children, the poor, and foreigners be- fore we became a masculine profession." Barbauld was uniquely privileged in he / educational opportunities (she even persuaded her father, Dr. Aiken, to teach her Latin and Greek), although she was not an advocate of schools for women. She seems to have promoted instead the more unofficial instruments of literary culture as a means of disseminating knowledge to women.” (365-366)

            <Title>critical context</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. </Text>

            <Text>Reforming Gothic readers: repurposing the supernatural in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads
Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]
Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)
My project filling the gap: Hannah More!
Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.
[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

            <Text>Sandvoss, Cornel. “The death of the reader: literary theory and the study of texts in popular culture.” Fandom: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World, edited by Jonathan Gray, C. Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrington. NYU Press.

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.
What do you think?
(via fanhackers)
“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!
I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.
Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

            <Text>Dear Dr. Kahan and Dr. Menon,

I hope I can sneak in under the wire for your Friday 13th deadline, to be considered for your MLA panel of “Queer Lists.” An abstract of my proposed paper follows. I have also attached an abbreviated 2-page CV (focused on my research), in case that will be useful to you. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information which would be helpful, and many thanks for your consideration.

Tentative title: “Reparative Algorithm Studies”

Abstract: My work takes a critical algorithm studies approach to digital databases of eighteenth century literature, examining the structural assumptions of the most-used resources (including some that scholars don’t like to admit to using). I close-read the database structures, file formats, and historical documentation for the English Short Title Catalogue, Eighteenth Century Collections Online, the Text Creation Partnership, HathiTrust, Project Gutenberg, and Google Books, to examine how each resource’s algorithmic definition of a “book” (and the information that might matter about a book) is shaped by the material, historical conditions of each organization’s development. My initial research question was, by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s definition, a classically paranoid approach: I sought to expose the under-representation of women’s writing underlying apparently “neutral” digital infrastructures. This question carried the combined urgency and futility of paranoid critique: urgent, because an unfair database would expose an unfair society; and futile, since the research could only be motivated by the conviction that its answer was already known. My paper will touch briefly on some specifics of this research and my findings, as the basis for a broader discussion of critical algorithm studies, and the project of imagining reparative algorithm studies.
One of the current problems of critical algorithm studies is how difficult it is to move from critique to action: it seems that no matter how carefully we dissect the flaws of oppressive computational systems, we cannot opt out of them. Excellent work by scholars like Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Safiya Noble, for example, meticulously historicizes computational systems, and there is real value to the denaturalization of the systems they thus reveal. But this work relies on the paranoid logic of exposure, and I am interested in other attitudes. In my examination of digital infrastructures for eighteenth century studies, I take a brief detour through Marxist thinking (via Bourdieu and John Guillory) to diagnose a deep tension between capitalist and anticapitalist value systems as the likely cause of the flaws in these systems today. I then am to move beyond the obvious paranoid critiques prompted by this observation. I confess that, at this stage, this is the point at which my thinking remains speculative— but I feel certain that the right direction lies in queer strategies of creative reappropriation, subversion, and resistance.

            <Text>“Privileging one kind of writing, however ‘‘invisibly,’’ means demoting others linked closely enough to it to be perceived as viable substitutes.” (Gamer 7)

“Rather, then, than echoing Anne Williams’s argument that ‘‘ ‘Gothic’ and ‘Romantic’ are not two but one’’30 because of their shared poetics, I wish to focus upon the economic and ideological processes that have insured their lasting separation.” (Gamer 10)

“As Jon Klancher has argued persuasively, reviewers and readers hardly constituted homogeneous, let alone mutually exclusive, groups.17 Yet the relevance of Jauss’s strata does not lie in the accuracy with which they represent actual British readers or reading habits, but rather in the uncanny resemblance those conceptual catego- ries bear to the similarly imprecise ideas that late-eighteenth-century British writers and reviewers held about the makeup of their own readership.18          This imprecise knowledge of fellow readers has been confirmed in recent scholarly research on literacy and reading habits at the end of the eighteenth century – research that has characterized British culture as experiencing exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences.19 Few conservative prose writers in the s, for example, display an informed awareness of this new diversity of readership beyond making increasingly anxious calls to police the reading of women and adolescents and to contain the circulation of radical texts like The Rights of Man (). (32)

“Both Fergus’s and Kaufman’s findings concerning the readership of fiction suggest statistically about gothic readers what Austen’s Henry Tilney here embodies: that men ‘‘read nearly as many as women,’’ and that gothic fiction attracted educated and elite readers capable not only of understanding irony but also of treating their own reading experience with it. For Austen, as for Kaufman and Fergus, the actual gothic reader has little in common with the ‘‘young ladies and . . . luckless reviewers’’ assumed by the Monthly and other Reviews to be the only readers of gothic fiction. That Austen raises and explodes this assumption about the gender and level of education of gothic readers twice in the same passage provides us with some sense of the prevalence of the stereotype and degree of irritation it caused her. Looking to Northanger’s famous passage defending novels, furthermore, the perpetuators of such a stereotype are equally clear: ‘‘Let us leave it to the Reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans.’’38 		These ‘‘threadbare strains’’ of ‘‘abuse,’’ and the effects that they had on other writers in the period, require further investigation and theoretical work. In writing prose fiction, Austen has little choice but to defend the novel against reviewers and to supplement their portrait of the naive female gothic reader (Catherine) with an older and more sophisticated counterpart (Henry). For a poet, dramatist, or learned editor, however, such a direct defense of – and association with – popular fiction is both unnecessary and, in the face of the repetitive vitriol and cliche ́s of eighteenth-century reviewing, undesirable. By the end of the eighteenth century, in fact, gothic reviewer–writer discourses have become so hyperbolic and so mechanistically conventional as to force us to re-examine their cultural function. Gothic writers and reviewers may ostentatiously speak to one another, but the utter sameness of their mutual addresses spurs us to ask for whom these authorial prefaces and critical reviews are intended, and where, if anywhere, communication exists in these discourses. Put another way, in discourses so predictable in their rhetoric and modes of address, why do gothic writers and reviewers write with so much energy?” (40)

“I wish to argue, however, that the ritualistic abuse of gothic writers by gothic reviewers involves more explicit acts of intimidation as well. Gothic reviewers most often attack individual gothic works, and gothic as a genre, not to remonstrate with gothic writers to write in other genres, but rather to make clear to other readers – and especially to other writers – the cultural costs of reading and writing gothic texts. However indirectly stated, this communication constitutes a palpable threat, and if gothic reviewers perform a specific kind of cultural work, it is to define and reiterate the risks of reading and writing gothic to those members of the British readership contemplating it. Looking back to the above-quoted review of The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, for example, gothic readers risk associating themselves with the ‘‘unformed mind[s]’’ of adolescents, with the ‘‘stupidity’’ of female ‘‘nonsense,’’ and with the vitiated tastes of readers for whom ‘‘wonders, and wonders only, can charm.’’ More seriously, gothic writers risk losing their cultural legitimacy, social respectability, and standing as serious authors. I read gothic’s critical reception, therefore, as a regulatory discourse – carried out under the fiction of paternalistic advice to a given gothic writer, but functioning as an implicit threat to other readers and writers potentially attracted to the gothic.” (42)

“At the end of the eighteenth century, gothic emerges next to, and comes to play a special role within, these larger debates about the utility and risks of reading in the absence of formal education and training. With Ian Duncan, Robert Miles, and Edward Jacobs, then, I read the emergence of gothic fiction between 1760 and 1790 as a response to the novel and as an attempt to align romance with the dignity of history and with the poetics of the medieval metrical romance and Shakespearean tragedy. ”(57)

“romance’s reception provided a language for reviewers to criticize gothic’s other perceived transgressions against existing literary and social codes: among them the need to keep genres ‘‘pure,’’ disciplinary boundaries distinct, and ‘‘better books’’ in appropriate hands” (51)</Text>

For female: value.replace(/Mary|Hannah|Charlotte|Ann|Eliza|Jane|Anne|Maria|Margaret|Stéphanie|Catharine|Frances|Sophia|Hester|/,"female") &lt;— problem here was probably the extra “|” at the end
…. Though this led to problems like William becoming “femalemfemaleafemalelfemaleefemale” so then I undid two steps and started verifying that no strange results were being produced by looking at a text filter of the gender column.
“George|Charles|Robert|Samuel|Richard|Joseph|Henry|Edward|David|Alexander|Francis|Benjamin” worked as expected.

Timeliness and feeling, as investigated through bibliographical research and reparative reading, thus chart a tangled network of interrelated concepts. Reparative reading requires an openess to the multiplicity of meaning which works may accrue as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and adapated in response to the pressures of timeliness. Precise bibliographical research can recapture and contextualize the complex and variable strategies of feeling that competed throughout the period.

            <Text>Review Reviewed Work(s): Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation by John Guillory Review by: Jan Gorak Source: Modern Philology, Vol. 94, No. 2 (Nov., 1996), pp. 286-290 Published by: The University of Chicago Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/437977 Accessed: 01-06-2019 21:45 UTC 
Gorak has particularly good summaries of Guillory’s arguments within individual chapters, esp. his close readings.
“Impatient with the frustrating course of the current debate, the author wants to expand and, in expanding, change utterly the terms of that debate. Rather than increase the number of works taught in the classroom, Guillory wants to widen access to the school. Without universal access to the school, he suggests, entry to the literary canon appears a cruel irrelevance, a key that promises entry to the palace of art but leads only to the dungeon. In an expanded school system, however, canons wither away or dwindle to less imposing significance. For once the school becomes the construction site for diverse and autonomous communities embarked on an ongoing process of judgment and creation, then there is no need for a special class of cultural monuments that carry special privileges. "Reschooling society" tolls the knell for monumental canons, and maybe even for art itself; but it rings in the arrival of any equitable social order. This is how Guillory's last chapter wraps up his bold "thought experiment" (p. 340).” (Gorak 287) — I don’t think she totally got it?
“Such idealistic hopes for the school of the future will almost obli- gatorily involve an author in some harsh verdicts on the schools of the past and the present. In an opening chapter that matches the breadth of his last, Guillory demonstrates how canonizers and canon busters are both locked into the restrictive notion of "representation" that has tacitly controlled the contemporary controversy about the canon. "Representation," he argues, leads to the politics of the image, where a few "marginal" authors find their way into classrooms still in- habited by a privileged social and ethnic minority. "Representation" overlooks the demographic composition and social functions of the institutions responsible for instruction in public literacy and advanced literary study that Guillory labels "the school.”” (Gorak 287)
“By now it is clear that Guillory has constructed his case studies to convict literary studies of abdicating from the public space. Hence it appropriate that the third case study should turn to Paul de Man, the Captain Grimes of the Yale graduate program, whose wartime journalism supplies further evidence of the political deficiencies of the twen- tieth-century literary mind” (Gorak 289)
“The cribbed, cabined, confined condition of the English Studies bequeathed by the de Man legacy clears a vast space for the emanci- pation narrative unfolded in Guillory's last chapter.” (289)
“Guillory's classroom without walls is something few educators at a time of shrinking budgets, declining enrollments, and burgeoning radicalism will find it in their hearts to resist. I wonder, however, whether a work on the problem of literary canon formation can pro- ceed in the way Guillory's does. It is surely the case that people who produce art and people responsible for teaching it both form canons. It is surely the case, too, that from Thomas Love Peacock to Ezra Pound the first group of people have rarely venerated the contribution made by the second. But the importance of artists, so central to much of Bourdieu's work, is something Guillory barely registers, nor does he make an adequate inventory of the range of textual operations per- formed in the literature departments of twentieth-century schools. Consequently, Cultural Capital launches its broad utopian projections from a dangerously narrow base.” (Gorak 290)</Text>

            <Text>Smith’s posthumous critical reception has undergone multiple shifts in appreciation and obscurity. Duckling’s study of her presence in anthologies indicates that shortly after her death in 1806, Smith was widely eulogized and anthologized, remembered and emulated as an important British poet. As the nineteenth century went on, poetesses began to be anthologized separately from poets, in collections with ambitions that were commercial rather than intellectual; Smith, too, “lost intellectual ground” even as she continued to be sold (Duckling 2016). By the end of the nineteenth century, even these volumes marginalized Smith’s poetry, with prefatory material which dismissed them as trite and depressing, unenjoyable reading. In the early twentieth century, Smith began to be considered as a novelist, rather than a poet; this new field did not lead at first to a much better reputation for her. Florence Hilbish produced the first extensive study of Smith, considering her as both poet and novelist, in 1941, to unappreciative reviews: Ernest Bernbaum’s faint praise said that “‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable,” since “the subtle or intricate is absent from Charlotte Smith's writings” (138). Hilbish presents Smith’s emotional poetry as sincere rather than conventional, and her prose as more motivated by politics than commerce.
Duckling credits the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s with the beginning of Smith’s recovery (217): the renewed interest in women’s writing rediscovered her novels, and especially the radical political content which Hilbish had observed. At the same time, Bishop Hunt published a record of Smith’s influence on Wordsworth, as demonstrated by an almost overwhelming amount of physical evidence: Wordsworth owned copies of her works, which he annotated; he copied out some of her sonnets in his own hand; he paid her a personal visit; he edited some of her poetry for publication; he wrote explicitly of her influence in notes to his works. Hunt calls Smith “an important early influence on Wordsworth which has not been explored in any detail up to now” (85); his abstract somewhat snarkily asserts that “Wordsworth did not suddenly start writing sonnets in 1802 simply because he happened to read Milton’s.” However, Hunt has little praise for Smith herself: of one poem, he says, “Whatever the artistic value of such verses,” what matters is the underlying theme which Wordsworth would later express more masterfully (89). Smith continued to be treated separately as an interesting woman novelist, and a minor pre-Romantic poet, through the 1980s. Smith rose to greater prominence in both of these fields in the 1990s: with work by Stephen Curran, Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, Andrew Ashfield, and Jacqueline Labbe, “Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism” (Duckling 217).
Throughout this history, two aspects of Smith which have prompted frequent re-assessments are her personal life, and her work across genres. The first matter, the importance of a female author’s life as a woman to her importance as a figure worth remembering, is implicit in several phases of the rise and fall described above. Fry is not alone in concluding that “[f]ew writers have presented themselves in their works so fully as did Charlotte Smith” (3): Smith’s poetry lyricizes her personal experiences, her novels feature autobiographical stand-in characters, and “the often intensely personal pleading prefaces” (Behrendt 189) to her works explicitly ask for them to be read light of her ongoing struggles. Perhaps as a result, much scholarship on Smith takes the stance of The Literary Encyclopedia in defining her as a woman who wrote because of, and chiefly about, her personal distress. Antje Blank’s article there highlights Smith’s financial motive to write: “Smith turned to writing when a failing marriage and a costly lawsuit left her without resources to raise her large family” (Blank). “And so,” Blank says, Smith “churned out” her novels (and the many editions of Elegiac Sonnets, and her other poetry, and her educational writing) to support herself and her nine children (Blank). Even when Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets “won her the reputation as an author of serious verse,” this is important primarily because it “lent greater respectability to her ensuing productions in a less prestigious but more lucrative genre – the novel” (Blank). At the same time, as Labbe argues in her article “Selling One's Sorrows: Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and the Marketing of Poetry,” Smith cultivated a public persona as a paragon of victimhood and motherhood, suffering deeply but turning her suffering into marketable prose out of a duty to her children. In periods where this image of womanhood is valuable, Smith is more easily valued, as in the eighteenth and nineteenth century anthologies which saw Smith as a moral exemplar (Duckling 203-4). Or, in periods when women’s resistance to patriarchal oppression is of scholarly interest, the direct, personal nature of Smith’s writing is valuable in itself, as in early feminist scholarship.
A complicating factor to these evaluations of Smith is that, as Labbe’s edited volume Charlotte Smith in British Romanticism thoroughly demonstrates, Smith’s writing is neither as uniform nor as simplistically personal as autobiographical readings sometimes see it. Labbe contends that Smith-the-novelist and Smith-the-poet have been largely studied as separate entities, “and consequently we have been learning about two separate Smiths, each closely linked to the genre she writes in, neither closely linked to the other” (5). Labbe is not quite the first to attempt to unify Smith: Carol L. Fry’s 1996 monograph Charlotte Smith also addresses her poetry before moving on to the several phases of her novel-writing, including the children’s writing which made up much of Smith’s later career but does not appear in Labbe. Indeed, from the beginning, Hilbish’s 1941 monograph explicitly identifies Smith as “Poet and Novelist” in its title. However, Labbe is accurate regarding the somewhat different assessments of Smith current in the somewhat separate study of novels and of poetry in general: Labbe argues that as a novelist, Smith is now often praised for her innovative narrative techniques (implying a mode of writing that is intellectual and ‘distant’), whereas as a poet, she is praised for her innovative expressions of interiority (implying a mode of writing that is emotional and ‘close’). Labbe draws greater attention to important differences between Smith’s writing personae in different genres, and her edited collection “pulls together many Smiths” (2) to address these disjunctions. The volume not only addresses her novels and poetry, but also includes her plays, letters, and posthumous reception. Each of these Smiths, the volume contends, has something innovative and unexpected to reveal, important to the formation of British Romanticism. In Judith Phillips Stanton’s “Recovering Charlotte Smith's Letters,” for example, Smith’s letters, less studied, reveal a third kind of writer, different from both the novelist and the poet, who conceives of herself as a professional businesswoman of her craft. More Smiths are available in genres not included in this volume, such as Smith the naturalist and children’s author (touched on only lightly in Labbe’s volume), or Smith the political philosopher who drives Amy Garnai’s Revolutionary Imaginings in the 1790s, a highly political Smith who consciously participates in the “political public sphere” conceived by Habermas, despite Habermas’ insistence that women were excluded from this sphere (1). From these distinctions, Labbe concludes that “Smith, significantly, composes herself anew according to genre” (2) — and then asks, “Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres?” (5). This question about genre is one of the initial questions to inspire this dissertation: to see it asked as a core question about Smith demonstrates Smith’s suitability as a figure whose career can shed light on important questions about the mediascape of the 1790s.</Text>
            <Comments>[Something about each Smith having her own peers…? Political Smith now becomes peers with Mary Robinson and Elizabeth Inchbald, whereas Poetic Smith is peers with Wordsworth &amp; Coleridge, and Novelistic Smith with Radcliffe etc]

            <Title>Coleridge wrote "We Are Seven"</Title>
            <Text>“My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-'A little child, dear brother Jim,' —I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jim.” (WW)

And it’s even an IN JOKE, and he uses the stanza just as Coleridge wrote it, deleting the joke without replacing it with anything!! This is not transcendent inspiration and individual genius. (He had long left behind the mountain and the girl when he wrote; he was thinking about tea time!)

— It is perfectly fine to be thinking about tea time; the poem is still wonderful. But the myth simply doesn’t work.</Text>

            <Text>Wikipedia: “In September 2011, the Authors Guild sued HathiTrust (Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust), alleging massive copyright violation.[12] A federal court ruled against the Authors Guild in October 2012, finding that HathiTrust's use of books scanned by Google was fair use under US law.[13] The court's opinion relied on the transformativeness doctrine of federal copyright law, holding that the Trust had transformed the copyrighted works without infringing on the copyright holders' rights. That decision was largely affirmed by the Second Circuit on June 10, 2014, which found that providing search and accessibility for the visually impaired were grounds to consider the service transformative and fair use, and remanded to the lower court to reconsider whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue regarding HathiTrust's library preservation copies.[14]”

            <Text>This dissertation has been centrally concerned with textual selection. In this final chapter, I wish to experiment with a perverse and speculative form of textual selection: true randomness. The value of speculative computing, as a methodology in a liminal space between the humanities and computer science, lies in its ability to be useless in a thought-provoking way. Of course one would not seriously suggest that we study literary history through texts chosen at random… but what would happen if we did it anyway? To write this chapter, I used a random number generator to choose [X] texts from [Y] resources. [LITERARY BLUF - last thing to write]</Text>

            <Title>this is why: corpora rely on databases</Title>
            <Text>What is “out of scope” for almost all discussions of corpus building, even when framed as textual selection or sampling or modelling, is how the scholars go from the list of texts they wish to examine, to the digital surrogates for those texts. To be more explicit: underneath many a carefully-curated well-theorized corpus is, usually, a database. Again Bode is unusual, because she describes the creation, maintenance, lacunae, and even the irregular funding of the Trove database underlying her own corpora. More common is an approach like Underwood’s, where methods sections dead-end in HathiTrust or, perhaps, the British Library. 

“the suggestion implicit in databases such as EEBO and ECCO that this deluge of texts they make available is complete, constituting a form of universal coverage, leads the average users, especially the average students, to be lulled into a false sense that they now have access to “everything.” This in turn reinforces a belief that if you don’t find something—an author, a text, and a document—in these massive digital repositories, it did not exist” (Ezell 9)

For essentially practical reasons, moreover, researchers often work within just one database ecosystem.

This, then, is why the rest of this chapter will tell a long and perhaps even excruciatingly detailed history of databases: because the implicit arguments of textual selection must be made explicit, and a database, too, carries an implicit argument in its textual selection.</Text>

            <Text>“Divided into three sections, the collection aims, firstly, to address the literary–cultural contexts in which her fictions first circulated, be that in relation to critical assessments of her work in the period 1789–1850, her relation to earlier eighteenth-century writers, her complex political engagements or her singular position within Romantic-era print culture. The chapters in the second section seek to provide a fresh and systematic re-examination of Radcliffe’s œuvre, taking care, in each instance, to situate her works in relation to some of the major preoccupations of Romantic aesthetics. The chapters in the third and final section seek to chart Radcliffe’s relations to Romantic poetry, her influence upon other prose writers of the period and the adaptations of / her popular romances on the Romantic stage. Composed by an international cast of scholars, Ann Radcliffe, Romanticism and the Gothic aims to extend the appreciation of Radcliffe in critical directions that, to date, are only in the early phases of development, particularly with regards to those aspects of her œuvre that lie beyond the narrow confines of the Gothic.” (xiii-xiv)</Text>

            <Text>Betty T. Bennett’s estimate that there were over 3,000 short poems on the war published in newspapers, periodicals, and magazines supports such contemporary claims (BWP&gt; p. ix). Over 200 individual volumes of poetry with titles referring to the war, battles, or military or naval figures, were reviewed in periodicals between 1798 and 1820, a count which obviously excludes those works not reviewed and. does not give any idea of the number of war poems contained in collections of (p.4) verse with non-specific titles.

During the period of the invasion crisis, from 1797 to 1805, poetry, along with, other forms of writing, was seen as almost exclusively devoted to the French threat; as the Gentleman’s Magazine commented, ‘[i]n poetry or prose the universal, object of patriotic Britons is, to pursue and expose the Invader of the rights of human kind’ (p 4)

The British war effort was indeed huge, ‘prima facie at least as big. as France’s’, according to Geoffrey Best, with the regular army expanding from 40,000 men in 1793 to 250,000 in 1813 and the navy from 45,000 sailors in February 1793 to 145,000 in 1812.11 These regular armed forces (p.6) were supplemented by volunteer forces which at the height of the invasion crisis of 1803 numbered as many as 400,000 men.12 It has been estimated that during this period of invasion crisis, from 1797 to 1804, as many as one in six, or even one in five, of all adult males was involved in the armed forces in either a voluntary or an enrolled position.13

They have also been estimated to have cost 315,000 British lives, which, as Best argues, by one statistical method can be presented as a higher proportion of servicemen than that lost in the first world war«15 As David Gates has shown, the casualty rate of the wars was high, with 18,596 dying in 1794 on active service and 40,639 men discharged ‘on account of wounds or infirmity’ over the next two years. The attrition rate remained high throughout the Napoleonic wars, 16,000–24,000 casualties being incurred each year,16 (p. 6)

For example, the broadsheet ballad ‘Millions be Free: A New Song, Tune—“To Anacreon in Heaven”’, part of the Bodleian ballad collection, was also printed in a less radical version as ‘An Ode on the Restoration, of Freedom to France’ in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in January 1793.30 The broadsheet version of this poem, ‘Millions be Free’, written in the context of the French decree of November 1792 offering ‘fraternity and assistance to all peoples who seek to recover their liberty’31 concludes each stanza by looking forward to the spread of revolutionary ideology with a variant of the couplet—‘While FRANCE rises up, and proclaims the DECREE, | That tears off our Chains, and bids MILLIONS BE FREE’. The ‘Ode’ ends each stanza with ‘That tears off their our chains, and bids millions be free’ (emphasis added), which like its title (‘An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France’) and certain subtle but significant changes in tenses, allows the poem to be read as a celebration of the Revolution in France without the broadsheet’s call for the future spread of revolutionary freedom, The ‘Ode’ version illustrates Michael Scrivener’s argument that ambiguity was a necessary feature of much of the radical verse published in newspapers and magazines, enabling a text to satisfy different factions or ‘sides’ (PR.28–9), whereas the anonymous broadsheet version was able to present a more direct and extreme message. As this suggests, texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration (PR 26). (P. 10)

In this context, it is unnecessary and reductive to make too careful a distinction between ‘poetry’ and ‘song’, given that the same text could be experienced in these different ways, though it is important to bear in mind how different realizations of the text may have an impact on its mediation of the war. (P. 11)

As well as its links with the ballad and song tradition, poetry had strong connections to theatrical and visual culture, which also mediated the war to the British public, frequently calling upon a deep-rooted Francophobia which held a strong place in the popular imagination. The theatre provided one arena for the singing of patriotic songs and the performance of bellicose poetry. As Gillian Russell has argued in an excellent study of the interrelation between the theatre and the war, the various elements of ‘an evening’s entertainment at the theatre consisting of music, song, interlude, occasional addresses, afterpieces, pantomime, pageants, and spectacle … considered together. «.… reveal the extent to which the whole enterprise of the theatre at this time was dedicated to the commemoration of the war and the enhancement of patriotic values’.37 ) (P. 12)

Similarly, poetry and visual culture were frequently mutually reinforcing in their constructions of the war. The interrelation of the two forms is well illustrated by the republication in the government-controlled newspaper The Star in December 1793 of David Garrick’s two (p.13) inscriptions written to accompany William Hogarth’s pair of prints, The Invasion39 These prints had been published in March 1756, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years War with France, and Garrick’s verses read like a collection, of the clichés of French and English national identity … The republication of these verses illustrates the extent to which at the outbreak of the war in 1793 there already existed a powerful set of ideas about British and French national identities that could be easily invoked (p.14)through stock, images and phrases.

The poetry of the 1790s often stresses the continuity of the French threat, even if Hogarth’s and Garrick’s embodiment of it in the figures of priests with ‘their axes, wheels and ropes’ are replaced by sansculottes with their guillotine. For example, a widely read poem of 1793, ‘A Word to the Wise, A New Ballad on the Times’,45presents the French ‘Mounseers’(echoing the word used by Garrick) as threatening ‘Englishmen’ in various ways, including stealing their food, teaching them to dance, talking in clubs, murdering women and priests, destroying the institution of marriage, and indulging in wife-swapping and cannibalism, With its (p.15)presentation of dance teachers as a kind of advanced guard, the poem draws on eighteenth-century anxieties about French fashions and interests making England, ‘a province of France’.
— How does he know it’s widely-read?

Just as anti-Gallican and pro-war writers and editors had a range of sources from which they could draw in their representations of the war, so too did ‘the friends of peace’, the various groupings who held a variety of anti-war convictions during the period.47 For example, a feature of the early issues of the Cambridge Intelligencer, which was founded in July 1793 and gained a ‘national reputation as it promoted anti-war opinions’,48 was its republication of earlier poems of anti-war protest, such as John Scott’s ‘The Drum’, first published in his Poetical Works (1782) and widely reprinted (BWP 80). (P. 15)

The continued power of ‘The Dram’ during the wars is illustrated by the pro-war, patriotic parody of it. beginning ‘I love that drum’s inspiring sound’, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1804 (BWP 330). Like its republication of ‘The Drum’, the Cambridge Intelligencer’s publication of a sixteen-line extract from a poem by Bielby Porteous, who became Bishop of London in 1787, written when he was a student at Cambridge in 1759, shows how the anti-war sentiment of the opening years of the war drew on the eighteenth-century enlightenment critique of international conflict. Printed under the title ‘The Bishop of London’s Opinion on War’, the lines present a powerful critique of war as the product of kings’ ‘Ambitions’

While Scott crucially transformed the way in which conflict was imagined during the Napoleonic period, as I will argue his emphasis on poetry’s power in enabling the reader to imagine battle exemplifies one of the era’s key ideas about the representation of war. As a number of critics have observed, for the majority of the population, war, at least in the form of battle, was something that took place outside their immediate experience, Mary A Favret has put this case most forcefully in her essay ‘Coming Home: The Public Spaces of Romantic War’, in which she sees print culture as protecting the population from the conflict, arguing that in ‘the years between 1793 and 1815 when England was almost constantly at war with France, publicity raised a paper shield—a shield of newspaper reports, pamphlets, songs and poems—against the destructive violence of war’.53 Denied the empirical, contact with war’, the population experience it only through the mediating, filtering, and altering forms of intellectual, and. verbal conventions which ‘shield’, ‘cloak’, and even make ‘invisible’ ‘the first major European war in. the era of the public sphere’ (539). In this book I want to counter Favret’s argument by stressing that writers were acutely aware of this sense of distance between the reading public and the war and that they saw the imagination as the means of bridging this gap and of making war visible (p. 18)

For example, when the publication of the Wickham-Barthélemy correspondence in April 1796 brought to an end Coleridge’s hopes that negotiations between Britain and France would lead to peace, he responded by publishing in The Watchman extracts from An Accurate and Impartial Narrative of the War describing the British campaigns of 1794–5, prefacing them with the (p.19) comment: ‘The horrors of war must therefore be re-commenced.—Let those who sit by the fire-side, and hear of them at safe distance attentively peruse the following’.54 Here Coleridge places his faith in an eyewitness account of the treatment of the wounded and of the casualties of war to bridge the gap between the safety of the fireside and the scene of war, but in much of the war writing of the period it was through the ‘imagination’ or ‘fancy’ that readers could themselves become eyewitnesses to the conflict (p. 18)

Though, probably written in 1791 prior to the outbreak of the war with France,72 Southey published ‘To Horror’ in. Poems (1797), where it becomes an important part of the anti-war strand of that volume (in which it was followed by two of Southey’s best known anti-war poems ‘The Soldier’s Wife’ and ‘The Widow’) and he heightened the poem’s attack on war and linked it to the current conflict by attaching to it a lengthy footnote which presented a ‘picture of consummate horror’ in the form of the eyewitness account of the campaign of the British expeditionary force in Flanders in 1793–5 that Coleridge had quoted in The Watchman.73 (P. 24)

If the imaginative grand tour of the sublime ode provided one means of transporting the poet and reader to the battlefield, another poetic (p.25) means of paying an imaginative visit to the scene of conflict was provided by the sub-genre of ‘The Field of Battle’ poem, a category which I have named after Thomas Penrose’s highly popular mid-eighteenth-century work of that name.74 Penrose’s poem remained popular throughout the romantic period; it was republished in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in May 1794 and The Courier in January 1800 and included by Thomas Campbell in his Specimens of the British Poets (1819), as well as being widely adapted.75  (P. 24-5)

As these versions of the ‘Ode to Fancy’ and ‘The Field of Battle’ illustrate, throughout the 1790s poetry was adopted as a form through which the imagination could ‘paint’, ‘picture’ or ‘portray’ war. … The picturing of war through the poetic imagination was used by both those who sought to celebrate war and those who wished to condemn it. (P. 27)

Fawcett reinforces the overall claim of this poem, and of the volume as a whole in a note to this stanza in which he provides a prose equivalent to his poetic strategy, arguing that the cold reports of the newspapers disguise the individual histories of war, in which each statistic: (p.30) “stands for a long pathetic story (which, if told at length, could not fail to bring tears into all eyes) of a dying man, extended on the cold, uncurtained, unpil-lowed, unattended, conch of earth; trampled on, or passed by, with savage neglect, instead of being surrounded with soothing ministers to his final necessities; and encompassed, instead of the silence of the chamber of death, with scenes of tumult and distraction! Who, that contemplated, in the sum of the slain, at the conclusion of a battle, an accumulation of such affecting pictures as this, could read the tragical amount, without a horror that should cause his head to swim, and strike a sickness into his heart?” (11)
As this Hymn suggests, representations of suffering on the battlefield were central to- anti-war poetics, contrary to influential recent arguments that the British, reading public was protected, from the horrors of war by print culture. After all, the Anti-jacobin identified the portrayal of the physical damage of war as one of the central features of Jacobin poetry: ‘we are presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered peasants, and deserted looms’.85 To use the terms of the texts themselves, the war poetry of the period is a poetry of piercing and boring,86 of wounding and bleeding,87 of mangling, shattering, breaking, (p.31)maiming and scarring,88 of agonizing pain and groaning,89 and of dying.90 The ‘horrid scene’ of ‘The Field of Bailie”, strewn with ‘Slaughter’d men and mangled cattle’,91 becomes the crucial site for the representation of war’s damage, whether represented in the poetic diction of the eighteenth century as ‘th’ensanguin’d plain’ and ‘the blood-empurpled plain’, or in the graphic terms used to describe the scene of conflict in January 1795, ‘Belgia’s reeking plain’ where ‘Alternate horrors rise and reign!’92 Rather than, protecting, the British public from the destructive violence of conflict, much of the poetry of the period aimed to make the reader feel war’s pain and suffering; war poetry was more like a paper bullet than a paper shield.

As much recent theoretical work has shown, war is inextricably linked (p.33) to the production, reproduction, and circulation in society of ideas about gender and gender roles.93 It has been argued that, after biological reproduction, war is the activity where the division of labour along gender lines has been the most obvious and where sexual difference has seemed the most absolute and natural

In all these cases the enactment of a specific role demanded by the emergency of war enables women to move beyond what is perceived to be their natural role, a process which can be presented as either only a temporary necessity before the natural role is resumed or a more radical questioning of the construction of such roles. (P. 34)

But for other poets war threatened to overwhelm poetry and to render it irrelevant, an anxiety expressed by Elizabeth Moody in the “Preface’ to her collection of poems of 1798, Poetic Trifles:
I am well aware that this is no period favourable to the Muse.
	•	This is no time for calm, familiar talk,
	•	Like man and maidens in an evening, walk.
	•	War is our business. POPE’S HOMER
At a season, therefore, like the present,—when the monster WAR is sounding his terrific alarms;—when the spirit of discord is in the air, and pervades every Atmosphere,—when it not only stimulates the combatants in the field of battle, but in the field of Literature,—when the fiend POLITICS is sharpening the pen to make it like a two-edged sword; and the Pamphleteer builds his hopes of Celebrity on the basis of Spleen and Acrimony—How I presume to ask, may the compilation of a few harmless Numbers be expected to engage the public attention?106
Here Moody locates, poetry within the context of the ongoing pamphlet war of the 1790s, and suggests the tension between the dominating political concerns of the decade and poetry’s supposed ability to transcend (p.38) such historical crises. While displaying the diffidence required of a woman poet in the later years of this decade (especially in a volume beginning with a poem entitled ‘Thoughts on War and Peace’), Moody’s comments raise a number of the major concerns of this book. How could poetry, ‘a few harmless numbers’, engage the attention of the reading public in wartime? Was there a role for it when confronted with ‘the monster WAR”? If poetry was constructed, as feminized, particularly in its elevated forms, in a period when the nation was demanding manliness-embodied in the active figures of the soldier, the sailor, the volunteer, and even the nation itself, how could poets—be they men or women-speak on international events with authority? And at a time when ‘Literature” itself was becoming defined by the field of battle, what would be the impact on poetry of more than two decades of conflict between Britain and France?107 (p. 37-8)

As mentioned above, it has been estimated that one in four families was directly involved in the wars and like much of the poetry of the 1790s ‘Effects of War’ emphasizes that while war is fought abroad its effects are felt at home. Much of this poetry focused on widows and orphans, calling on their tears and sighs as the ultimate indictment of war» a technique with biblical and classical precedent.114 Already an important figure in the literature of sensibility, the widow was used in numerous poems to represent the cost of conflict  … The widow also became the subject of the writing of some of the most ambitious poets of the decade, including Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, and Robert Southey, whose work will be examined in the next two chapters. These writers made particular use of one of the sub-genres of war poetry in the period, the ‘ruined cottage’ poem which figures war’s impact on the domestic sphere through the image of the increasingly dilapidated building, often a symbol for the widow herself.116 Poets also used the ‘ruined cottage’ form to represent the more general social and economic crisis caused by conflict (p. 40)

Robert Merry’s poem ‘The Wounded Soldier’, written circa 1795 and printed in The Spirit of the Public Journals in 1799, illustrates this fusion of war’s damage to the soldier and to the home in startling fashion (BWP, 242).

Other poems rewrite returning soldier narratives to contain the troubling implications of the figure. One such piece, ‘The Soldier’s Return’, published in the Scat’s Magazine in April 1804, reads like a rewriting of Merry’s ‘The Wounded Soldier’ as a returning soldier worries that his sudden reappearance might produce a similarly fatal effect on his loved ones (p. 43) … ‘The Soldier’s Return’, then, repeatedly invokes the tropes of anti-war poetry only to present them as fictions; the soldier’s injuries are lies and his story ‘feign’d’. Published in the year after the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens and during the period of invasion crisis, ‘The Soldier’s Return’ reclaims an anti-war figure for patriotic purposes, making the returning soldier a figure in a comic narrative of war that ends in marriage rather than the grave. Yet it is a narrative shadowed by its tragic other, in a poem of illusions, the father’s exclamation that he and his wife may ‘escape the grave’ strikes a note of romantic fantasy that emphasizes that it is the soldier’s own escaping of the grave that is the poem’s real illusion. (P. 44)

While the writers of such verse may not really expect their poems to be read by ‘the self-call’d great’ or ‘Monarchs’, they use such figures as a means of illustrating poetry’s potential power on the reader, calling especially on the language and models of sensibility. (P.45)

Published in November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin’s lament predates Nelson’s much celebrated triumph at the battle of the Nile of 1 August 1798, yet even before this ‘glorious victory’ there was no lack of poets keen to sing the actions of British heroes, with the naval victories of Howe over the French on the ‘Glorious First of June’ 1794 and Duncan over the Dutch at Camperdown in 1797 providing popular opportunities. Similarly there did exist a poetic register for overwhelming the ‘horrors of war in its glory’, seen, for example, in a poem by ‘Panormus’ published sixteen months before the declaration of war entitled ‘The Triumphant Warrior’ which celebrates war as a uniting force that provides an opportunity to prove one’s bravery and to gain honour and fame (p.47)

One poet who might have hoped that he filled the Anti-Jacobin’s role of ‘one good and true poet’ was Henry James Pye, appointed Poet Laureate in 1790, whose ‘duteous Muse’ produced two ‘Odes’ each year, one for the New Year and one for the king’s birthday, as well as other occasional pieces to celebrate particular occasions.128 These odes were set to music by the court musician and sung before the king at the state drawing rooms, after which they were widely published.129 (p. 48)

In his non-laureate verse, Pye sought to use poetry to urge the war’s continuation and to inspire his readers’ participation in it, publishing translations of the elegies of the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus in 1795, for example.135Pye’s attempts to inspire martial fervour met with a mixed reception, however, and an amusing account included by T. J. Mathias in a note to the 1796 edition of The Pursuits of Literature illustrates the varying appeal of his poetry to different sections of society. According to this account, ‘[s]everal of the ReviewingGenerals … were much impressed with (the] weight and importance’ of the translations and had them “read aloud at Warley Common and at Barham Downs, by the adjutants, at the head of five different regiments, at each camp, and much was expected. But before they were half finished, all the front ranks, and as many of the others as were within hearing or verse-shot, dropped their arms suddenly, and were all found fast asleep!”136 (p.50) The laureate’s failure to inspire the troops reinforces the Anti-Jacobin’s sense of the lack of ‘One good and true poet’ and suggests the need for a different poetic mode to bolster the war against France, a mode that would be supplied by the metrical romances of Scott, who would become the unofficial laureate and whose poetry was capable of inspiring soldiers even in the arena of conflict.
Over the next few years the Gentleman’s Magazinewould adopt Tasker as their version of the bard whose work was ‘so well calculated to animate loyal Britons against invaders, and to inspire the necessary unanimity and concord’ and was ‘exceedingly well adapted to the present times; since it breathes a threefold spirit of Poetry, Loyalty, and Patriotism’.151 Over a nine-month period from December 1798 to August 1799 it reprinted the ‘Ode to the Warlike Genius of Great Britain’, originally published in 1778, in which Tasker presents the Bards as divinely inspired figures whose role was to ‘Inspire the sons of Mars in dreams, | And fire their souls in warlike themes’.152 But the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott. (P. 53)
A bold claim!!! Is it also possible that a reprinting offers something important that contemporary poetry does not…?

While this opening chapter has looked at a wide range of examples, subsequent chapters will focus more closely on particular writers and texts produced at key moments of crisis or emergency to show how poetry was conceived and employed as a vital form in representing and imagining war and how the conflict with France shaped the self-conceptions of individual poets as well as broader formulations of the function of poetry itself. The next three chapters will look at the issue of the poetic (p.54) role in wartime in the writing of four of the major poets of the opening decade of the conflict, Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. Chapter 2 argues that Smith and Coleridge responded to wartime moments of crisis (the declaration of war and the invasion threat respectively) by making the imagining of the conflict a crucial function of their poetry and a key element of their identities as writers. Chapter 3 examines how Southey and Wordsworth defined their poetic identities in relation to war, war poetry, and each other during the years 1798–1802, while Chapter 4 argues that in his political sonnets of 1802–3, written during the invasion crisis, Wordsworth reconceived his poetic role, and poetry and the nation more generally, as ‘manly’. Chapter 5focuses on Walter Scott, who transformed the poetic imagining of war during the conflict (and for a century to come), shifting the emphasis from war’s horrors to its picturesque excitements in his metrical romances. The influence of this transformation of war is examined in Chapter 6 which examines the way in which the dominant new understanding of the war as romance was deployed and resisted in poems written on the Peninsular War by Felicia Hemans, Lord Byron, and Robert Southey, as well as by Scott himself. The final chapter will look at two poets writing in the decade after Waterloo whose identities were shaped by their sense of themselves as war poets, Byron and Hemans, and argue that looking back on the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars they find in the siege a figure for the total and dominating conflict that defined the age through which they had lived.

Charlotte Smith’s reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, two months after France’s declaration of war on Britain, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the eighteenth century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. Smith begins the poem, with a model of fancy as a delusive power to which women are especially vulnerable, a continuation of her conception of it in Elegiac Sonnets. But. the encounter of her poetic persona with the figures of war in boo-k II forces a reassessment of the poetics of sensibility that had characterized the collection of poems which had made her famous. Moving away from a poetics which finds its metaphors for the self in the suffering other, in The Emigrants Smith presents the victims of war as beyond the limits of suffering known to either her persona or to the British public, all of whom are ‘safe’ from the conflict, ‘by the rude sea guarded’ (II. 210).1 It is through imagining war in poetry, and insisting on the public’s imagining of war, that the poet can bring the war home to the reading public and bring the conflict to an end. In conceiving of the wartime role of the imagination in this way, Smith transforms the function of a faculty that was becoming particularly associated with women (p.56) and constructs her poetic role as specifically feminine, finding her model for the poet in the figure of the mother.

writing five years later in ‘Fears in Solitude’ Samuel Taylor Coleridge addresses, what he sees as a national failure to imagine the war. Like Smith in The Emigrants, in ‘Fears in Solitude’ the poet addresses a nation distant from the scene of conflict—’Secure from actual warfare’ (l. 88)2—and, like her, he ultimately offers his own imagining as a model for the nation. But while Smith represents her imaginative powers through the feminine figure of the mother, the Coleridgean poet is a specifically masculine figure, mature and paternal If in Smith’s text the imagining of conflict will lead to war’s extinction, Coleridge’s poem is driven by an opposition between the poet’s imagining of war and the nation’s failure to do so that threatens, to bring ‘actual warfare’ to Britain. While ‘Fears in Solitude” emphasizes the challenge of war to the poet and war’s role in the development (and remasculinization) of this figure, it also occupies a place as an important document in the evolution of Coleridge’s ideas about the imagination, A text which supports Nigel Leask’s ‘demand of Imagination’ that it occupy ‘a position of accountability in the practical realm’,3 ‘Fears in Solitude” illustrates the political function that Coleridge outlined, for the imagination in much of his writing of the 1790s. Yet in creating an opposition between the ‘imagined’ and the ‘actual’, Coleridge was establishing the framework for his influential post-Waterloo accounts of the imagination, the poet, and the absolute genius which would detach them from the world of “realities’. The imagining of war, then, plays a major role in the development of the romantic imagination. (P. 56)

Smith develops this concern with fancy in book I of The Emigrants, her two-book blank-verse poem which, describes the encounter on the south coast of Britain, of her poetic persona with various religions and aristocratic exiles from revolutionary France, Smith began the poem in 1792,7 three years after the publication of her sonnet, and throughout book I emphasizes the delusive nature of fancy which she associates with women, especially a series of mother figures and her own poetic persona. (P. 58)

It is the demands of war on Smith as a poet that leads her to redeem fancy in book II of The Emigrants and to reconstruct her poetic identity and role’ France declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793 and, by positioning the two books, of The Emigrants either side of this date, Smith emphasizes how the change in historical moment from book I to book II is crucial to her poetic reconceptions. Whereas book I is set on ‘a Morning in November, 1792’ (p. 135), book II is dated ‘an afternoon in April, 1793’ (p-149); and while the events of war that Smith describes in book II are those of the civil war in France of the previous year, 1792—‘The Summer past’’ (II. 213)—as described by the emigrants, it is Britain’s entry into the war that leads to the change of emphasis, No longer a poem about exile, in book. II The Emigrants becomes a poem about war (a shift emphasized by the epigraph from Virgil (p. 149)) and Smith constructs a very different model of the role of fancy in response to this changed context.

In The Emigrants Smith puts her faith in the émigrés’ first-hand accounts of the war to provide the basis for her own and her readers’ imaginings of conflict. Her attachment of detailed prose footnotes to her poetic pictures of the war seeks to further emphasize the accuracy of her text’s representations of the events of summer 1792.13 However, to guarantee the impact of her recounted depictions of war on her readership, Smith frames them through cultural forms that evoke an emotional response enacted by her poetic persona. (P. 63)

Smith’s depictions of ‘savage War’ in these pictures and tales culminate in a daring and powerful denunciation of ‘the closet murderers’ whom we style | Wise Politicians’ (II. 320–1 ) and the polemical nature of her poem is suggested by her use of the phrase ‘plunder’d peasants’ in her description of the pictures of war (II. 229). When in 1797 the Anti-Jacobin outlined the favoured topics of Jacobin poetry, it commented that ‘we are presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered peasants, and deserted looms’.15 While the Anti-jacobin may not have had The Emigrants specifically in its sights here (though I have not found the phrase elsewhere), its use of the phrase does locate Smithes text within a political poetics that the periodical sought to counter and which it strikingly sees as characterized by its emphasis on the physical damage of war. (P 64)

While Smith’s quotation from Gray’s ‘Elegy’ emphasizes both her poetic-identity and the- role of sensibility in her work, she here insists on sensibility being directed away from ‘selfish sufferings’.16  (p. 65)

But. six months after she-had completed The Emigrants, the nature of her relation with the war would again change, and with it her sense of the authority of her poetic role, For on 6 September 1793 her seventh, son Charles, an. ensign in the Bedfordshires, was wounded during the Duke of York’s campaign on the borders of France and Holland.17 (p. 66)

‘Written in. April 1798, During the Alarm of an Invasion’, as its subtitle announces, ‘Fears in Solitude’ has long been regarded as one of the (p.68) crucial accounts of Coleridge’s shifting response to the war with France, with the strident anti-war poet, lecturer, and journalist of the mid-ijgos seeking to realign his political position as a result of international developments, especially the French occupation of Switzerland in early 1798, itself the subject of Coleridge’s ‘The Recantation: An Ode’, published in the same quarto pamphlet by Joseph Johnson.22 Yet while a poem of political crisis on both international and personal levels’ ‘Fears in Solitude’ is also a poem which presents the threat of invasion as at least in part the product of a poetic crisis, and. specifically a national failure of imagination and feeling. Like Charlotte Smith, Coleridge identifies the separation of the British public from the scene of war as crucial to their response to it (p. 67-8)

As Coleridge argued in a piece entitled ‘Insensibility of the Public Temper’ in the Morning Post in February 1798, the familiarity of European, events to the reading public meant that their impact on the imagination had lessened: ‘What is familiar to the imagination ceases to-be terrible; and what ceases to be terrible we no longer feel a strong inducement to resist’ (EoT, I. 22), (p 69)

The euphemistic language of war has become detached from what. Coleridge elsewhere terms ‘realities’, realities registered here through the physical damage to the soldier’s body, the emotional response of the widow (a variation of a figure previously used in ‘On the Present War’ and ‘Religious Musings’)25 and through divine Judgement. (P. 70)

Like Smith, Coleridge imagines war through the figure of the fleeing widow and baby, but whereas for Smith such a. scene was unimaginable in Britain, in 1793, except as an. imagining, for Coleridge the feared invasion threatens to turn a literary trope into a reality in his native isle. (P. 73)

Writing in the 1790s, Charlotte Smith and Samuel Taylor Coleridge both offer the imaginative poet as a model for the nation’s response to war, and their detailed poetic examinations of the functions and effects of the imagination reveal the extent to which they saw this faculty as having an essentially political function, contrary to influential accounts of the imagination which see it as transcending, compensating for, or displacing, the political.38 Yet paradoxically ‘Fears in Solitude’ can also (p.78) be seen as a text which begins the detaching of the imaginative from the political on which such later accounts are built For while Coleridge could appeal to the nation’s ‘truth-painting Imagination’ in his 1795 slave-trade lecture, ‘Fears in Solitude’ distinguishes between the poet’s imagining of the war and the nation’s failure to do so. The poem differentiates the poet from the rest of the nation and establishes an imaginary world created by him and peopled by the creatures of his imagination

Coleridge’s definition of the faculties of the poet remain much the same as in the 1790s, but if in that decade feeling and imagination were the base of his politics, twenty years later they have become entirely separate from it. While the poet’s imagination (or ‘fancy’, as it is now) continues to paint, it is no longer ‘truth-painting’ and its images would no longer be confirmed by the fleshly eye; indeed the very power of the poetry is proof of the lack of observation of war. Rather than the poem having its origin in ‘realities’, it is the poet and his ‘seething imagination’ who becomes its source, in an anticipation of Abrams’s expressive model of romantic poetry.43 In this ‘Preface’, Coleridge completes one of the major transformations of the imagination in the romantic period, but even while seeking to discredit and disclaim his earlier construction of his poetic identity, his account, emphasizes the extent to which his highly influential ideas about poetry and imagination were formulated in relation to the era of war in which, he lived. (P.79)

———

IN ROBERT SOUTHEY’S blank-verse poem ‘History’, written between mid-1798 and early 1799, the poet asks himself the repeated, question ‘Was it for this …?’1 Examining the development of his ‘young mind’ and ‘swelling heart’ and his aspirations to ‘love | his fellow kind’, the troubled writer finds himself confronted by the ‘crimes’ of history and calls on ‘gentle Poesy’ to receive him from, scenes such as ‘the fields of war’ so that he may ‘nurse | My nature’s, better feelings, for my soul | Sickens at man’s misdeeds’ (II. 1–8). This familiar narrative of an overwhelming sense of personal and political crisis producing a turn away from ‘History’, often figured as here as a retreat to a bower, has been a major feature of accounts of canonical romanticism, and still holds considerable sway. (P. 80)

It seems likely that Southey and Wordsworth drew on the same sources in Ariosto, Milton, Thomson, and Pope for the phrase “Was it for this …?’ but less certain is whether either knew of the other’s use of it in their contemporaneous explorations of poetic identity. (P. 81)

Wordsworth was probably the first to use the formula, beginning his first draft of The Prelude with the phrase in October 1798 in Goslar.5 Southey’s poem was published in January 1799 and the evidence of his Common-Place Book suggests it was written shortly before this, though in later editions he dated it to Westbury 1798, which would mean it could have been written any time after June 1798.6 At 31 lines to The Prelude’s eventual 8,000, ‘History’ may seem more like a reductio ad absurdum of Wordsworth’s epic than a genuine answer to it, but it does offer a manifesto for a different poetic mode to the one normally defined as romantic, one that is politically committed and speaks with what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ’the calm, collected public voice’.7 (p. 82)

If Southey’s poem opens by establishing an opposition between two kinds of writing’History’s ‘Chronicle’ and the strains of ‘poesy’, only to collapse that distinction in his own historically inspired song, this opening opposition invokes and parodies the way poetry was often feminized in the writing of the 1790s as a trembling or timid Muse who turns away from the subject of ‘war, horrid war’, seeking like the poet of ‘History’ the shelter of the bower, removed from ‘the court’s polluted scenes, … dungeon horrors, … [and] … the fields of war’ (II 4–5). This chapter will examine the way in which Southey and Wordsworth responded to the war in their poetry and show how the war played a major role in the shaping of their poetic identities. (P. 82)

These developments in Wordsworth’s writing, particularly as they affected the relationship between his poetic role and his response to the figures of war, can be examined through a discussion of one of his encounters with history in ‘The Discharged Soldier’, a blank-verse fragment describing an incident that probably took place in 1788 and that Wordsworth would later include in book IV of The Prelude.26 Written in 1798, the year Southey’s encounter with history in the form of Clio prompted his poetic rededkation, Wordsworth’s encounter also produced a moment of poetic dedication, but one in which ‘History’ remains an other that troubles the poet’s sense of vocation. Wordsworth represents the experience of war through encounter and tale-telling, as his wandering poetic persona, on turning a corner, finds ‘Presented to my view an uncouth shape’, who he later sees is ‘clad in military garb’ (II. 38, 54).27 Like the figures of war in Wordsworth’s earlier poetry and like the many returning soldiers of the newspaper and magazine poetry discussed, in the opening chapter, the soldier tells his tale:
	•	when erelong
	•	I asked his history, he in reply
	•	Was neither slow nor eager, but unmoved,
	•	And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,
	•	A stalely air of mild indifference,
	•	He told a simple fact: that he had been
	•	A Soldier, to the tropic isles had gone,
	•	Whence he had landed now some ten days past;
	•	That on hts landing he had been dismissed,
	•	And with the little strength he yet had left
	•	Was travelling to regain his native home.   (II. 94–104)

(p.89) The soldier’s history is a familiar one, and Toby R. Benis has given, a powerfully contextualized reading of the poem as one that ‘criticizes Britain’s leaders’. seeing the soldier as a figure ‘whose sickly condition and wanderings are direct products of government policy and military service’.28 Yet in the context of the newspaper and magazine verse on wounded and returning soldiers, what is striking in Wordsworth’s presentation of the soldier’s telling of his tale is its lack of political and polemical force and its failure to produce the conventional poetic responses of sympathy or indignation on the part of the poet, In its attack on the Jacobin Poet in the second issue of 27 November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin had criticized the political use of sensibility ‘by-many authors … in sonnets and elegies without end’, giving an outline of the standard poetic techniques used by the writers of such verse:
A human being, in the lowest state of penury and distress, is a treasure to a reasoner of this cast. He contemplates, he examines, he turns him in every possible light, with, a view of extracting from the variety of his wretchedness new topics of invective against the pride of property. He indeed (if he is a true Jacobin), refrains from relieving the object of his compassionate contemplation; as well knowing, that every diminution from the general mass of human misery, must proportionally diminish the force of his argument29

In his treatment of the discharged soldier, it is as if the Wordsworthian narrator is responding to this attack, recommending that he accompany the soldier to the dwelling of a labourer who ‘will give you food if food you need, | And lodging for the night’ (II. 114–15). And reinforcing the soldier’s failure to fulfil the polemical and emotive role that would be allotted to him in political poetry, the poet again questions him about his ‘history’, this time providing him with a veritable checklist of the radical agenda of anti-war poetry:
	•	While thus we travelled on I did not fail
	•	To question him of what he had endured
	•	From, war and battle and the pestilence.   (II. 137–9)

But again the soldier’s answer fails to produce the ‘topics of invective’ we have seen in other treatments of the figure: (p.90)
	•	He all the while was in demeanor calm,
	•	Concise in answer: solemn and sublime
	•	He might have seemed, but that in all he said
	•	There was a strange half-absence and a tone
	•	Of weakness and indifference, as of one
	•	Remembering the importance of his theme,
	•	But feeling it no longer.   (II. 140–6)

The soldier’s delivery of his tale, like the fact that ‘He appeared | To travel without pain’ (II. 122–3), undermines the poet’s expectation that he would encounter one of the physically damaged victims of war, akin to Robert Merry’s ‘The Wounded Soldier’, discussed in Chapter 1. The normal ‘feeling’ response to tales of war is blocked by the poet’s sense that the soldier himself no longer ‘feels’ the importance of his theme and rather than producing expressions of just indignation against contending governments the encounter leads only to silence (II. 149).

Southey’s and Wordsworth’s poetic, encounters with ‘History’ in 1798, in the forms of Clio and the discharged soldier, exemplify the developments (p.92) of their poetic identities, evolving out of and continuing to inform their treatment of the figures of war. Their different trajectories as poets and their contrasting poetic responses to the war can be traced through their poetic dialogue over the next few years. While Southey reviewed Lyrical Ballads for the Critical Review in 1798, mo-re revealing of his response to the collection and to Wordsworth’s poetry of the late 1790s in general were the many poems he wrote in 1798 and 1799 which directly echo and rewrite Wordsworth’s published and unpublished poetry of the period.35 As Mary Jacobus has argued, these borrowings should not be seen as plagiarism but as ‘a deliberate attempt [by Southey] to put right what he had criticized in his review’, restoring the Ballads to the context from which they had been taken, replacing what Jacobus terms their new sophistication, oddity, arnbitiousness, imagination, universality, and symbolism with topicality, simplicity, and familiarity.36 Developing Jacobus’s argument, I think Southey’s rewritings of Lyrical Ballads counters what I have been arguing is one of the fundamental manœuvres that characterizes the development of Wordsworthian romanticism, the shift from a polemical humanitarian concern with suffering individuals to a psychological interest in their state of mind. Instead, Southey writes history back into Lyrical Ballads. (P. 91-2)

Wordsworth had himself subscribed to the fifth edition, of Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets of 178937 and ironically, given his failure to acknowledge her influence over his own sonnets in the account of 1843, he described Smith in 1835 as ‘a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered’.38 (p. 108)

——

Epilogue:

ADAM FERGUSON’S READING of The Lady of the Lake to ‘the rough sons of the Fighting Third Division’, with which this book began, and Felicia Hernam’s poetic imagining of war in response to the ‘magic page’ of The Talisman, with which it has ended, illustrate the centrality of Walter Scott’s writing to the envisioning of conflict during the romantic period. While the popularity of Scott’s metrical romances was superseded by the phenomenal sales of Byron’s poetry and his own success as a novelist in the years after the war, his reimagining of war remained tremendously influential throughout the nineteenth century, playing a major role in the chivalric revival, in the elevation of the warrior to heroic status, and in the romanticization of war that Michael Paris has seen as defining the ‘warrior nation’ from 1850 to 2000.1 For example, Scott’s description of the battle of Flodden in Marmion continued to be regarded by many as the greatest ever battle poem throughout the nineteenth century. In 1833, W. B. O. Peabody described the ‘glorious battle scene’ as ‘one of the finest passages of narrative poetry in the language’,2 while in the 1880s John Ruskin assessed it as ‘the truest and grandest battle-piece that, so far as I know, exists in the whole compass of literature’, adding in a note: ‘I include the literature of all foreign languages, so far as known to me: there is nothing to approach the finished delineations and flawless majesty of conduct in Scott’s Flodden’.3 Indeed, (p.226) Marmion became the benchmark for assessing all poetic accounts of war. Thomas Hardy once responded to criticism of Homer’s Iliad, Oh, but I admire the Iliad greatly. Why, it’s in the Marmion class!’4
The continued influence of Scott’s poetry on the imagining of conflict can be felt in verses written at the opening of the First World War» such as Julian Grenfell’s ‘Into Battle’ with its emphasis on ‘the joy of battle’ and Herbert Asquith’s ‘The Volunteer’ with its portrayal of a clerk fearing that ‘his days would drift away | With no lance broken in life’s tournament’,5 And the attacks of the poets of that war on the idealization of conflict were in part a response to a verse tradition, as well as a broader cultural movement, that can be traced back to Scott. For example, when Siegfried Sassoon condemns the conception of the war as romance in ‘Glory of Women’—’you believe | That chivalry redeems the war’s disgrace’6—he does so by invoking and undermining a typically chivalric moment in The Lord of the Isles when the King sends his cavalry into battle:
	•	‘Forward, each gentleman and knight!
	•	Let gentle blood show generous might,
	•	And chivalry redeem the fight!’ (VI. 24)

And Scott’s influential transformation of the imagining of war was not limited to Great Britain. In Life on the Mississippi (1883), Mark Twain diagnosed the ‘Sir Walter disease’ which infected the Southern states of America prior to the American Civil War through Scott’s creation of a ‘Middle-Age sham civilization’ (while Twain’s particular target is the novel Ivanhoe, his account of Scott refers equally to the poetry).7 The ‘Sir Walter disease’ attacked the imaginative self-conception of Scott’s readers» turning many of them into warriors (as the Eclectic Review argued Scott’s poetry had done to his British readers). Twain writes that ‘It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major or a Colonel, or a General or a Judge, before the war’ (469) and that ‘Sir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the war, (p.227) that he is in great measure responsible for the war’ (469). While Twain qualifies this argument by describing it as a ‘wild proposition’, it remains one for which ‘something of a plausible argument might» perhaps» be made’ (469). And Twain concludes by restating his argument, commenting that ‘The change of Character [responsible for the war] can be traced rather more easily to Sir Walter’s influence than to that of any other thing or person’ (469). Scott’s influence was such» Twain argues, that he can be held responsible for the American Civil War. While Twain symbolically enacted the end of Scott’s influence in Huckleberry Finnwhen he named the wrecked steamboat the Walter Scoff»8 it was the First World War which marked the culmination and the conclusion of the cult of chivalry and of Scott’s century of influence. But to borrow the formula of Twain’s ‘wild proposition’, in his poetry Scott transformed the writing of conflict during the Napoleonic wars and it is to the influence of Walter Scott» more than to that of any other thing or person» that we can trace the changed imagining of war in the nineteenth century.

            <Title>ECCO TCP</Title>
            <Text>Somewhat oddly, because the Text Creation Partnership texts are made freely available, they are also somewhat difficult to track down. There is no central location with all of them and their related information — not even the TCP’s website. In [YEAR], the website contained many broken links to possible places to download the corpus, and the best guide was actually a blog post. By [YEAR], a general redesign of the TCP’s website added more up to date links for TCP texts and clarified what kinds of information are available about them in each place. However, the focus was on searching and reading TCP texts, or downloading corpora of their full texts. It is possible to download the XML “headers” of all ECCO-TCP files from a University of Michigan Dropbox (last updated Nov 5, 2012 by Paul Frederick Schaffner), though these headers consist of thousands of individual xml files.
I was also able to download, from a source I no longer recall, a csv of title information for all TCP works (including EEBO, Evan American, and ECCO); this csv includes years for me to filter out the 90s, but no publisher information that would allow me to focus on England.

To guess at the number of titles per year, I searched PhiloLogic4, which showed 511 titles for the range 1789-99. I searched individual years and the numbers added to 511, indicating that each work is only associated with one year.
The UMich site doesn’t allow this kind of search, even in the “Bibliographic” search mode — the closest it can come is selecting specific decades from a dropdown.

Each volume has its own entry.</Text>

            <Text>Google Books prioritizes low-quality information over no information. The algorithmic extraction of publication dates from title pages, for example, can never be perfect. But algorithms give their predictions with certainty estimates: if accuracy was a higher priority, Google Books could calibrate the algorithm to simply provide no answer when none of the possibilities cross a given certainty threshold.

Per http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1701 , they actually OVERWRITE metadata provided by partners with their algorithmic information!! They could very easily not.

“At its peak, the project involved about 50 full-time software engineers. They developed optical character-recognition software for turning raw images into text; they wrote de-warping and color-correction and contrast-adjustment routines to make the images easier to process; they developed algorithms to detect illustrations and diagrams in books, to extract page numbers, to turn footnotes into real citations, and, per Brin and Page’s early research, to rank books by relevance. “Books are not part of a network,” Dan Clancy, who was the engineering director on the project during its heyday, has said. “There is a huge research challenge, to understand the relationship between books.”” (Somers)</Text>

            <Title>STAR</Title>
            <Text>The ESTC is not actually only one database: “The STAR file, maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. … In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC’s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.” (Tabor 373) There are two kinds of information, in particular, which the STAR file contains and which is concealed from ESTC users: the true ‘verified’ status of individual edition matches, and edition-specific notes on known errors.
A “match” in the ESTC is a known copy of a book held in a library which serves as a representative of a particular edition. A match can be encoded as “verified” when an ESTC staff member consults the book to confirm that it corresponds to the edition in question, or “unverified” when this has not happened. But the STAR copy contains two additional verification statuses: when a contributor such as a librarian or a scholar submits a match, it is coded as a “web match.” “Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the ‘verified’ and ‘unverified’ levels” (Tabor 374). Automated uploads of various outside databases can also generate new matches, encoded as “catalogue matches;” these “have a comparatively low level of reliability” (Tabor 374). However, in the transition from STAR to ESTC, “The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to ‘verified’. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt” (374).

            <Text>Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99

My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise …  
TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters – or can you?
TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.</Comments>

            <Title>ECCO - DSL</Title>
            <Text>Several years in to the project, Gale released a new interface for their various collections, the Digital Scholar Lab, which provided new forms of access to ECCO texts. Through the Digital Scholar Lab, it was now permitted to download the OCR transcripts of facsimiles, though only 10,000 items could be downloaded at a time. To work within the Digital Scholar Lab’s restrictions, I created eleven “Content Sets,” one for each year 1789-99, and downloaded them individually. The query used to find each year’s works was “LIMITS: Archive (Eighteenth Century Collections Online) And Publication Date (1789).” All content sets were downloaded on June 2, 2020. For each content set, I downloaded the provided “metadata” .csv, and then used a simple Terminal command (cat *.csv &gt;merged.csv) to merge them together.

The merged spreadsheet of all eleven years had 45,027 rows. Adding the number of files in each year gives a total of 45,017, so the merged spreadsheet has 10 extra rows — probably repeating the title headings.
For reference, I ran a search with the query “LIMITS: Archive (Eighteenth Century Collections Online) And Publication Date (1789 - 1799),” which returned 44,121 results. This is a particularly unexpected mismatch, since it means items did appear when I searched for one year (e.g., 1797) but didn’t appear when I searched for a range of years that ought to have included that year. Unfortunately, since I can’t make a “content set” of all 44,121 items, there is no simple way to determine which 906 items mysteriously failed to appear.
Olli McMullin cleverly suggested that this mismatch might be due to serial publications, which appear in each of the years with which they are associated (counting them multiple times in the merged set) but only once in the full-span search. I investigated Helen Maria Williams’ Letters Written in France as a 1790s serial publication to see if this might be occurring. Indeed, Letters on the French Revolution, written in France, in the summer of 1790, to a friend in England; containing, various anecdotes relative to that interesting event, and memoirs of Mons. and Madame Du F--. By Helen Maria Williams (CW0104715153), which has the publication date “MDCCXCI[-MDCCXCII] [1791-1792],” appeared in both 1791 and 1921 content sets. This is not exactly a serial work, but rather a work of uncertain or flexible date, making the double-counting less appropriate. However, it can be addressed by removing duplicated Gale document ID numbers.</Text>

            <Text>“This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is "taken" actively while data is assumed to be a "given" able to be recorded and observed.” (3)
“the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework” … “The graphical force conceals what the statistician knows very well — that no "data" preexist their parameterization” (8)
“the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a "picture" of "data".” (12)
“In some circumstances (the example of the bar chart given earlier that was displaying information about gender, nations, and populations) ambiguity merely requires a higher order level of complexity in the model, so that apparent "certainties" are qualified by variables and nuances that can be specified in mathematical terms. But the idea of capta as fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena, is fundamentally different from the concept of data created as an observer-independent phenomena.” (50)</Text>

            <Title>Chi squared test</Title>
            <Text>OKAY, so, this is way less ~science~ than it probably appears, but: the rule of thumb for chi squared tests is to only do them when the expected value (if the null hypothesis is true) in any given cell is 5 or greater. In this case, we would have 4 cells (has tag/male, has tag/female, does not have tag/male, does not have tag/female), and the null hypothesis would be that the tags are just as likely to be in mens’ work as in womens’ work
(It could also probably work as a 2 cell test, and the nuances of which it should be are slightly above my read-about-this-for-10-minutes pay grade, but it doesn’t matter because you aren’t actually doing the test)
So the expected value in each cell would have to be 5 or above, which means that you would need at least 10 total works with the tag

Alyssa Fowers:
	this is less science-y than it appears because there are other statistical tests that you could do with smaller sample sizes, hOWEVER
	it’s something to go off of!
Lawrence Evalyn:
	thank you so much!!!!
Alyssa Fowers:
	and the chi-squared test is definitely the basic test you’d be most likely to use in this case


Alyssa Fowers:
	Actually, crud, what is the general % of mens/womens/unknown works in this set?
Lawrence Evalyn:
	uh, more women than men, lemme see
	His corpus is 43% female, 31% male, 26% unknown.
Alyssa Fowers:
	Ohhh okay, hm
Lawrence Evalyn:
	215 f, 156 m -- 58% female
Alyssa Fowers:
	So you’d want at least 5 in each group you’re looking at *if* it matched the distribution of the sample, I think
Lawrence Evalyn:
	(if we ignore the unsigned works)
Alyssa Fowers:
	you wouldn’t expect 50% men/50% women in a tag from this corpus--that would indicate an unusual number of men wrote about the thing. Let me math real quick
Lawrence Evalyn:
	so I guess my null hypothesis is, if there are 10 books, there should be 6 by women and 4 by men
Alyssa Fowers:
	(if we ignore unsigned works)
	Yeah

Alyssa Fowers:
	So you’d want 13 total works
	not including unsigned ones
Lawrence Evalyn:
	ok!
Alyssa Fowers:
	so that you could have at least 5 men
Lawrence Evalyn:
	because that would be 5 men and 8 women
Alyssa Fowers:
	Yeha
	I’m rounding up slightly because I don’t think you could have 12.5 women</Text>

            <Title>life</Title>
            <Text>Radcliffe’s biography, too, is short. Radcliffe never cultivated a public literary persona, which itself led to the development of a mythos of her seclusion. Almost all biographical information comes from Thomas Noon Talfourd’s 1826 “Memoir of Radcliffe,” written in close consultation with Ann Radcliffe’s husband William. Radcliffe kept extensive journals, which Talfourd occasionally extracts, but her manuscripts were all destroyed shortly after her death, with the exception of forty-two pages of her commonplace book from near the end of her life, and a two-sentence letter to a Miss Williamson (Rogers 2). Deborah Rogers’s 1996 Ann Radcliffe: A Bio-Bibliography, the first to examine the commonplace book, remains the best account of Radcliffe’s life and major works. Some simple facts are known. She was born in London on July 9 1763, the only child of Ann Oates Ward and William Ward, a haberdasher who later managed a china shop. Both of her parents were close to their slightly more illustrious relatives, and encouraged an old-fashioned sense of gentility in their daughter (Rogers 3). Radcliffe was married in 1786 at age 23, to William Radcliffe, “a hardworking Oxford law graduate who became part-editor and owner of The English Chronicle” (Facer). Unlike Smith’s and Robinson’s husbands, William Radcliffe appears to have used the household’s funds fairly responsibly, though when Ann Radcliffe’s mother died, one stipulation of her will was that Ann’s inheritance not be used to pay any of William’s debts. Certainly, William Radcliffe promoted the image of himself as a nurturing helpmeet to his wife: in the ‘origin story’ of Ann Radcliffe’s writing which Talfourd writes based on William’s descriptions, Talfourd credits William with encouraging his wife’s shy talents. Facer says, “He often came home late and in order to occupy her time, Radcliffe began to write, reading aloud the lines she had written during the day on his return” (Facer). Given how many critics emphasize Radcliffe’s obvious responsiveness to reviews — each novel directly altering the aspects most criticized in the previous — her writing seems not to have been entirely an idle amusement to pass long hours. Her six major publications appeared rapidly between 1789 and 1797. In 1798, Radcliffe’s father died, leaving some of his property to Radcliffe, some to her mother, and a small amount to William himself should he outlive his wife (Rogers 11). In 1800, Radcliffe’s mother died as well, leaving her property to Radcliffe on the condition that nothing be left to William and none of the money be used to pay William’s debts (Rogers 11-12). In 1802, Radcliffe wrote, but did not publish, Gaston de Blondville, her last major work of writing. Radcliffe spent the second half of her life enjoying the domestic retirement praised within her novels, sometimes travelling within England with her husband. She died in 1823, age 58.</Text>
            <Comments>That Radcliffe lived another twenty-six years after the publication of The Italian with no further works is a fact which has apparently demanded explanation since the eighteenth century. “In the total absence of documentation, contemporaries were willing to believe, presumably because she was the reserved (female) author of Gothics, that Radcliffe was insane. … So reticent and self-effacing was Radcliffe that she never corrected rumors of her death or madness” (Rogers 13). Her husband, however, was interested in countering these rumours, and after her death in 1823 publicized a report from her doctor unequivocally stating that she had died of asthma and that her “mind was perfect in its reasoning powers (E131 104)” (Rogers 20)[ cite the original], suggesting instead that Radcliffe had withdrawn from publication after her inheritance made the increased income no longer important to maintain the luxuries of her life. Scholars largely accept this financial explanation, and add to it the explanation that Radcliffe had always been a fundamentally shy person who found public criticism of her writing distressing. Although her works were widely praised, they received so much attention that inevitably there were also critiques, and she may have wanted to remain distant from “the parodies as well as the many inferior imitations of her work” (Rogers 13).</Comments>

  But who their mingled feelings shall pursue 
When London's faded glories rise to view? 
The mighty city, which by every road, 
In floods of people poured itself abroad; {160} 
Ungirt by walls, irregularly great, 
No jealous drawbridge, and no closing gate; 
Whose merchants (such the state which commerce brings) 
Sent forth their mandates to dependant kings; 
Streets, where the turban'd Moslem, bearded Jew, {165} 
And woolly Afric, met the brown Hindu; 
Where through each vein spontaneous plenty flowed, 
Where Wealth enjoyed, and Charity bestowed. 
Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet 
Each splendid square, and still, untrodden street; {170} 
Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time, 
The broken stair with perilous step shall climb, 
Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round, 
By scattered hamlets trace its antient bound, 
And, choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey {175} 
Through reeds and sedge pursue his idle way. 
  With throbbing bosoms shall the wanderers tread 
The hallowed mansions of the silent dead, 
Shall enter the long isle and vaulted dome 
Where Genius and where Valour find a home; {180} 
Awe-struck, midst chill sepulchral marbles breathe, 
Where all above is still, as all beneath; 
Bend at each antique shrine, and frequent turn 
To clasp with fond delight some sculptured urn, 
The ponderous mass of Johnson's form to greet, {185} 
Or breathe the prayer at Howard's sainted feet. 

…

Oft shall the strangers turn their eager feet {205} 
The rich remains of antient art to greet, 
The pictured walls with critic eye explore, 
And Reynolds be what Raphael was before. 
On spoils from every clime their eyes shall gaze, 
Egyptian granites and the Etruscan vase; {210} 
And when midst fallen London, they survey 
The stone where Alexander's ashes lay, 
Shall own with humbled pride the lesson just 
By Time's slow finger written in the dust. </Text>

            <Title>coda? - gothic</Title>
            <Text>A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.</Text>

            <Text>Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical--or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream”--printing circles. My network graphs model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a set of concrete and stable ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and authors. I consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, and correspondence societies. This then enables me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, in context with the print production which they are alternatives to. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me with two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices with the horizon of expectations within the radical circles I expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three, where they may in fact be marginalized. Together, these approaches further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.</Text>

            <Title>Tabor, Stephen. ESTC</Title>
            <Text>The British Library’s opening of the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC) to free public access on the Web in the autumn of 2006 drew a grateful and eager response from the worldwide community of scholars and their universities. Similar sentiments echoed from a lower-profile network of antiquarian booksellers, who, mostly lacking institutional support, had to weigh the potential value of every search in the file against a unit charge (in the United States) of $2.28 plus a connection fee of $4.05 per hour. Whoever footed the bill, the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing. The freeing of ESTC, which combines those two components with a continuation up to and including 1800, now places in one location, for the consultation of anyone with internet access, the fullest and most up-to-date bibliographical account of ‘English’ printing (in the broadest sense) for its first 328 years. Within its scope it has no rival. At the same time it cannot be called ‘definitive’ in the same way that one might have been in the habit of considering STC and Wing. This is because of its peculiar evolution over thirty years as an online database — always under construction, always exposed to damage from careless or ill-informed alterations, but always capable of improvement. Now that the British Library has made ESTC widely available, the time seems appropriate to explore some aspects of the relationship between this fluidity of content and the file’s status as an authoritative resource. (367)

An increasingly common trend, I am sorry to report, is that more and more people do not want ESTC at all — they want ECCO or EEBO. The younger generation of scholars in particular, lured by full-text images and ransacking the Web for illustrations for their books and articles, are using these utilities as de facto bibliographic databases. They find that the stripped-down records and simplified indexes are good enough for their purposes. To a minority of them, the fact that other works, editions, and copies exist outside the Web is irrelevant, and perhaps even irritating. To use a metaphor, some people prefer to explore the world through books of photo- graphs with occasional schematic maps. ESTC, on the other hand, provides the equivalent of a detailed topographic map, but no pictures. Such technical tools have limited appeal, even to some specialists; but if you want to thoroughly learn the lie of the land, you will need one, and the more complete and accurate the better. My comments below about how ESTC is used and perceived should be taken partly in the context of the differences and competition between these two markets — the world of pictures and the world of descriptions. It may be that, in time, a détente will be struck that will allow the unification in one database of the visual aspects of EEBO and ECCO with the full, constantly updated terrain-mapping power of ESTC — and make it all free.6 As things stand, the opening of ESTC is not only a widely hailed boon to scholarship; it was a prerequisite for its survival on the internet-based playing field. (368)

My discussion, therefore, concerns the needs of the specialist audience that has formed ESTC’s main constituency in the past and may reasonably be expected to continue as such: the explorers in the field who need detailed maps. In my task of mediating between the file and its users, I find that these people approach early books with questions regarding one or both of two broad topics: intellectual content and physical characteristics, the latter including the location of copies. For every question I get of the first type, I probably get five that deal with the physicality of books. (369)

Because ESTC is a bibliographical database rather than a catalogue, strictly speaking, its records describe groups of copies rather than specific copies. In the great majority of cases each record describes a single edition. This rule is bent when certain separately planned marketing units can be identified within the edition, such as reissues,7 imprint variants,8 and large versus regular-paper copies.9 For the later eighteenth century, when reprints from standing type became more common, ESTC cataloguers have occasion- ally granularized down to the level of individual impressions.10 This is a pragmatic and reasonable response to more complex bibliographical situa- tions, and the theory need not concern us here. For the purpose of this discussion it is sufficient to refer to all of these categories as ‘editions’.
ESTC’s most basic bibliographical function is to provide, for each edition, a description of the ideal copy, meaning the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it. (369)

To each of these ideal descriptions are attached records of physical copies that match that description. As additional reports of copies arrive, it may be that the ideal description must change in response. For instance, the existence of a half-title may only emerge on the evidence of the seventh copy reported. A half-title would then be added to the description of the ideal copy, and the six previously matched physical copies will receive notes recording that they are imperfect in this respect. When everything is working right, as it does in ESTC more often than not, the bibliographical description is completely accurate as far as it attempts to go, and variations in the matched copies can be reliably determined by the presence or absence of copy-specific notes. If anything happens to disturb the links between the description and its attached holdings, including errors committed in the course of creating the description, the record gets broken and starts telling lies about physical copies or, worse, about the ideal copy. Broken records waste people’s time by sending them off after new editions that turn out to be old ones, and after complete copies that prove defective or even non- existent. They force users to rewrite parts of the records for their own use, but these corrections rarely get reported back to ESTC. If enough records get broken, the file containing them starts to devolve to the state of some- thing like OCLC’s WorldCat — which is to say, a grab-bag mixing precision and approximation with little editorial oversight.
In ESTC the matching process hinges on five points of identity: the title, as far as it is given by ESTC; the edition statement; the imprint, again as far as it is given by ESTC; the pagination; and the format. (370)

“Complete title transcriptions allow each piece to describe itself more fully” (370) … “However, fuller transcriptions can also serve to undermine the reliability of the database.” (371). It is also difficult for a cataloguer to transcribe a long, pre-1701 title without committing a single typo. Using EEBO and ECCO before the eighteenth-century records were expanded, I checked the transcriptions in a random sample of 150 ESTC records, fifty each for the STC, Wing, and eighteenth-century periods.12 For imprint dates 1473–1640, 52 per cent of the records contained discrepancies that should preclude matching; for the 1641–1700 period, 28 per cent were unmatchable; while for the eighteenth century, only 10 per cent had errors.13” (371) “In my original sample of fifty eighteenth-century records with a 10 per cent error rate, thirty-eight have subsequently received expanded transcriptions, and the error rate among those is now 29 per cent — comparable to the Wing sample.” (372)
“This survey shows that the policy of giving complete titles, despite its numerous benefits, can actually have an adverse impact on the overall reliability of the file. On the purely mechanical level of reproducing title-page information, ESTC has adopted standards of description that tend to overshoot the ability of its cataloguers to meet them. Sometimes it is necessary to balance a zeal for exhaustiveness against the burden it imposes on human frailty, and the original planners of ESTC recognized this.”

“This trend is somewhat exaggerated in my survey: because of patterns of production and survival, a random selection from a given period will tend to be chronologically weighted towards its later end.” (371)

“The same human qualities that give rise to transcription errors by cataloguers allow their persistence through numerous proofreadings by matchers.” (372)

“Some records carry notes pointing out known problems with the tran- scriptions. Record S112807, created in December 1991, transcribes the word ‘plants’ in the title. In 2002 a grant-funded team, which worked at the Folger Shakespeare Library between 1996 and 2003, inserted a note in the record reading ‘DFONOTE” (372)
“‘DFo’ is the Library of Congress-assigned siglum for the Folger; ‘jre’ is the matcher’s initials. Once again, this record may be corrected shortly after the appearance of this article, and at the time of writing it was not possible to search for other examples by means of the public interface. The DFONOTEs appear in the ‘Uncontrolled note’ field, which is currently not searchable. ” (372)
“this is another example where a bibliographical record has accumulated a convincing weight of testimony supporting an erroneous description.” (373)

“The STAR file, maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. It also serves as a gateway for authorized libraries to make direct online matches of their holdings to ESTC. In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC’s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.” (373) 

“One useful innovation in STAR is an extension of the old verified/unverified/primary match types. These can be viewed in the public file, though only in the forbidding-looking ‘MARC tags’ display option. Contributor matches in STAR — those made outside the ESTC offices — are tagged as ‘web matches’, indicating that they were not vetted by ESTC staff. Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the ‘verified’ and ‘unverified’ levels.17 Matches derived from automated uploads from various outside databases are rather confusingly designated ‘catalogue matches’, and have a comparatively low level of reliability. These two new categories can be identified in the ‘MARC tags’ display, in field 852, subfield x, as letter codes W and C (supplementing the original V, U, and P tags).”
“The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to ‘verified’. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt.” (374) 

“Outside matchers using STAR who suspect a problem in a record are asked to attach a ‘cataloguer’s note’ or ‘annotation’ that becomes part of the STAR record. … Like the DFONOTEs, the STAR annotation immediately ruptures the bond between the bibliographical record and its attached holdings. Contributor notes in STAR are invisible in the public display, so regular ESTC users will be unaware of this reported preliminary leaf; but if they could read the note, there are few who would bet money on which of the matched copies have the order-to-print leaf and which do not. The situation will get more tangled as more matches arrive.” (374) “There are now more than 9,100 of these new ‘annotations’ in STAR, affecting records from 1483 up to and including 1800.” (374)
“These open construction sites are part of a trade-off for ESTC’s being able to claim virtual completeness within its declared scope, and there is no doubt that this completeness gives it a competitive boost vis-à-vis ECCO and EEBO, at least for some audiences.” (374)
“When the ESTC editors first authorized embedded error reports like the DFONOTES more than fifteen years ago, the assumption was that most of the reported problems would be resolved fairly quickly. This has not proved to be possible.” (375)
“With the probability (as my survey implies) that ESTC has a minimum of 80,000 records containing at least one error in description, a rigorous programme of rematches is clearly not feasible.” (375)
Do any of Tabor’s three proposals end up being adopted?
“the lack of compulsion to declare a work ‘finished’ is a great advantage of the online environment. One expects ESTC to be a work in progress more or less in perpetuity, and that is a strength not a liability as long as net order in the file increases.” (375)
“Six years ago an article appeared with a provocative title: ‘Who Will Edit the ESTC?’.34 By now the answer should be obvious: ESTC will never be edited, in the sense of being anything like a finished, comprehensive, and consistently accurate catalogue.” (384)

“Is it not                                         better to display all of these informal notes rather than presenting a                                         smoother façade to the public, showing some records whose accuracy or                                         completeness is known to be doubtful while concealing the evidence pending                                         eventual resolution? The answer depends on how one expects the file will be                                         used — whether the market is the picture-book audience or the topographic                                        map audience.” (376)
“Bibliographers, like academics in any field, need to beware of making unqualified statements in cases where doubts exist.” (376)
“Electronic records, like individual copies of books, habent sua fata. The ESTC records contain clues to their own provenance that can help more experienced users to recognize what David McKitterick has called ‘nuances of responsibility’.” (376)
“The building of ESTC has relied from the start mostly on direct reports of holdings from whatever libraries could be persuaded to generate and donate them. As the last few of my examples demonstrate, however, a great deal of information of potential interest to ESTC passes through the biblio- graphical community every day from a variety of sources. Some of it is anecdotal, some appears in antiquarian book catalogues and scholarly publications. For various reasons ESTC has never been very efficient at tap- ping these sources. In the last part of this paper I will discuss how the file reflects this isolation, and what may be done to lower the barriers between it and the bibliographical community.” (379)
“ By omitting to consult even the most basic biblio- graphical journals, the ESTC editors allow gaps to widen between the file and current knowledge.” (380)
“Even if ESTC took advantage of these broader sources, there is no guaran- tee that scholarly findings would translate securely to catalogue format. My final example will show how the diffuse authorship of ESTC can undermine its control of more complex bibliographical problems.” (380)
p.384: The point of my last example is that some problems in ESTC are better understood, and would perhaps be better handled, by amateur bibliographers rather than professional cataloguers. By amateur bibliographers I mean generally teaching academics, usually in English or history, but occasionally booksellers or even the odd curator
p.384: What these people want most from ESTC is simply for it to tell the truth about physical copies. All of them have new information that they would like to contribute to the file, and all of them can supply lists of errors and new locations. They are the best authorities we have.
p.385: there is a widespread feeling among these potential contributors to the file that the staff already have their hands full, and that new information tends to go into a box, not to be seen again … There is a need on the one hand and a willingness to provide on the other, but the supplies are not getting through. 
p.385: I have a proposal that can help bridge this gap without placing further commitments on ESTC staff. I believe the editors should consider allowing editorial access to the file to a few outside volunteers already trained in ESTC conventions. These volunteers would receive and assess new findings from the bibliographical community, and where appropriate incorporate them into ESTC.
p.386: To maintain its authority, its editors need to accept fully ESTC’s responsibilities as a definitive bibliographical resource. They can do so by reaffirming a basic commitment to accuracy, by allowing users to view all the information they need to use the file wisely, and by opening a wider door to those who have drawn benefits from ESTC, and who now bear benefits in return.</Text>

            <Text>Figure &lt;$n#fig:Smith-4dbs-alluvial&gt; is based on the data recorded in Table &lt;$n#table:Smith-4dbs&gt;, which was reformatted in excel and then pasted into the RAW Graphs visualization tool (Mauri et al.) and processed using their default settings for an alluvial diagram. Using an alluvial diagram required imagining the databases as sequential “stages” through which all books flow. Accordingly, I added a “source” for this flow of books by adding a column labeling every edition as falling into the category “Works printed in England, 1784-1807.” I could have chosen to place the following “stages” in any order; to assist in visualizing Smith’s representation in these databases as a process of winnowing down, I chose to place them in order from largest selection to smallest. The scale of each “strand” of the diagram is scaled in width based on the number of editions it represents, as per RAW Graphs’ default settings. The colours, fonts, and width of the graph are also simple defaults.</Text>

            <Title>Joseph Ritson's Robin Hood</Title>
            <Text>Me: @jesslockhart, the thing about my dissertation is this person Joseph Ritson whom I have INEXPLICABLY never heard of despite reading a bunch of books about 18thC ballads, Jacobin politics in poetry, etc etc etc. He seems like a REALLY interesting guy, RIGHT in my decade, and possibly a good candidate for some recovery work
Me: looks like ECCO doesn’t have his 1795 Robin Hood! 1789-99, all I have attributed to him are 3 critiques of somebody’s edition of Shakespeare, 1 critique of History of English Poetry, and 1 work titled “law-tracts”.
Cai: He's the guy who wrote The Robin Hood Collection, and he added the "give to the poor" bit because he was a Jacobin
Me: ESTC has 1 volume of shakespeare criticism and 4 of legal stuff attributed to him
Cai: Robin Hood before this shows up in lots of places as a stock character or in this story or another, but Joseph Ritson is apparently the guy who, having put almost all the circulating Robin tales into one volume, hands down to future writers/readers The Robin Hood and also a set of "outlaw stock tropes"
so if you're writing Outlaw Tales after 1795, you're indebted to Ritson (so we have found according to wikipedia anyway)

lawrence [9:33 PM]
31 ESTC titles mention Robin Hood, many unattributed, so Ritson must be hiding in there (edited)

cemhend [9:33 PM]
I wonder if he didn't credit himself as author but as compiler so that keeps him out of those dbs @lawrence? not sure how they work

lawrence [9:34 PM]
the specific MARC label I checked generally includes identified-by-scholarship relevant “persons” (as opposed to necessarily the author credited)
but if nobody bothered to go and encode that he’s the unsigned author it’s easy for him to get left out

jesslockhart [8:23 PM]
“In nearly all the small points with which he dealt, Ritson was in the right, and his corrections have since been adopted, but the unjustly bitter language of his criticisms roused great anger at the time, much, it would appear, to Ritson’s delight.”
Wiki indicates that Joseph Ritson was a shit disturber

            <Text>Hannah More’s Art of Reduction 
Andrew Heisel 
abstract 
Hannah More is widely viewed as a major figure in the rise of evangelicalism, but how she played her role is still in doubt. She can be read as a conservative interested in maintaining social hierarchy or even as a radical who levels social strata by insisting that only spiritual classifications are important. An underlying network of theological uncertainties in More’s writ- ing creates this divide in the criticism of her work. More insists on the plainness of the Bible, but, since readers nonetheless err, she suggests its plainness must first be matched in the reader in order for the text to be understood. She contradictorily indicates that the Bible or morally sound fictional works may improve the reader and that readers must already be purified before a text can have saving effects. On the one hand, this theological ambiguity can be liberating. On the other hand, the Pauline universalizing rhetoric on which More relies, rather than having the salutary impact recently described by philosophers Giorgio Agamben and Alain Badiou, creates a constant interrogation of self and others in order to reduce individual particularity. More’s fiction continually figures forth the need for an “annihilation of the self” that is to be admired for its saving power and yet also pitied for the suffering it creates—suffering which is the vehicle of both that annihilation and attendant salvation.

            <Text>Fischer-Starcke, Bettina. Corpus Linguistics in Literary Analysis: Jane Austen and Her Contemporaries. London: Continuum, 2010. Print. 
The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics.

            <Text>Chapter four introduces my mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. My understanding and use of network analysis is contextualized in light of Wendy Chun’s work on networks in “Queerying Homophily” \cite{Chun:2018tq}. I describe my methodology and its assumptions, and provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.</Text>

            <Title>DH as historical breach</Title>
            <Text>“Digital humanities” is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke’s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified “digital humanities” work.</Text>

            <Title>long history of using songs to be popular</Title>
            <Text>I've been thinking a lot about songs. As far as I can tell, in the 1820s, poets have been boldly revitalizing poetry by publishing edited versions of popular songs for at least fifty years.

The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects. But, seeing Wordsworth and Coleridge as participants in a literary conversation also makes them more interesting again, so I can forgive them their propaganda and just focus on how interesting it is that Wordsworth's 1798 "The Thorn" has so much in common with Hannah More's 1796 "Ballad of Robert and Richard" (both of them are trying to 'elevate' ghost stories above vulgar superstition, for the improvement of their audiences, but with completely different ideas as to what that entails).

The second part of "thinking a lot about songs" involves a leap of several hundred years: Jo Walton is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning writer, and she says that "the single most quoted thing I have ever written" is... a limerick she posted in a usenet newsgroup in 1998, "The Lurkers Support Me In Email," to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean.” I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find that Hannah More has also written a morally-improving ballad to that tune (or, if she hasn't, it's only because the song is too associated with Jacobins), and certainly her other songs all mention specific tunes which she assumes I will already know.

So there's something interesting to me, here, about the idea of layering your words over top of pattern someone else already knows, as a way to get your version to stick more easily in people's heads. I don't think Jo Walton was intentionally trying to write something extremely memorable, but Hannah More certainly was.</Text>

            <Title>Fry, Carol. Charlotte Smith</Title>
            <Text>Fry, Carrol L. Charlotte Smith. Twayne’s English Authors Series, edited by Herbert Sussman, Twayne, 1996.

“No writer’s works more clearly chart the shifts in British culture and the flow of ideas in politics and art during this time of change than do those of Charlotte Turner Smith. She was one of the most popular writers of the final two decades of the 18th century and among the most prolific. Her first three novels established the conventions that dominated the sentimental and gothic novel of the 1790s. Her early poetry, like her first novels, reflects 18th-century tastes, but her later poems place her in the forefront of the romantic movement.” (2)
“In her later work, Smith used her fiction and poetry as vehicles for the presentation of political ideas. Both her life and her art epitomize the ‘wrongs of woman’ in the 18th century. Aware that her audience was largely female and that young women received little education, she sought to inform her readers on the important issues of her day.” (2)

“By the end of her life, Charlotte Smith has developed not only into one of the finest poets of her day and a novelist who expanded the horizons of fiction but also into a writer whose works epitomize the romantic sensibility of the early 19th century.” (3)

“Few writers have presented themselves in their works so fully as did Charlotte Smith.” (3) &lt;- there’s more here</Text>

            <Title>Labbe, ed. Smith in Romanticism</Title>
            <Text>“This collection of essays pulls together many Smiths. For the first time in one volume we read of her as novelist, poet, playwright, letter-writer — and literary icon, gaining and then losing a posthumous identity through how others wrote about her. Perhaps because of the ways in which she has subsequently been recovered — moving from minor novelist and pre-Romantic poet to proto-feminist ‘personal is political’ figurehead, to central 1790s novelist and essential Romantic poet — Smith occupies several different rhetorical positions. This can be seen, for example, in how the several editors of her novels and poetry have read and presented her, as well as how she writes and presents herself. Smith, significantly, composes herself anew according to genre; readers both recognize and complicate this process.” (2)

“Very few Smith scholars work actively on both the novels and the poetry, and consequently we have been learning about two separate Smiths, each closely linked to the genre she writes in, neither closely linked to the other. Because the novel during the Romantic period is undergoing an extraordinary amount of change and innovation, as it moves closer to its modern form, editors of the novels (myself included) tend to focus on Smith’s techniques and innovations, her use of tropes and themes, her facility with genres and description. Conversely, because Romantic poetry in the Smithian tradition is so closely tied up with explorations of selfhood and subjectivity, memory and a personalized past, editors of the poetry tend to present it as reflective of a personalized state of mind, of ‘woman’s’ experience, treating its manifold themes and narratives as, finally, reducible to and manifested from Smith’s life. Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres? Genre, it seems, carries a greater force in constructing our preconceptions of identity than has been recognized, and Smith is a case in point, a case we can crack by studying closely Smith’s style and techniques across genres.” (Labbe 5)

“In its fourteen essays, this collection illustrates Smith’s depth and versatility as an author. It offers varied and astute readings of her work as deeply informed by history, culture, and politics, and through Behrendt’s and Duckling’s essays on her posthumous reputation and her literary afterlives, it shows how Smith’s centrality transmuted into a marginality derived from cultural insistences on seeing her as a woman who wrote, rather than a writer who was female. Countering the few lingering descriptions of Smith as obscure or minor, the essays in this volume aptly demonstrate how seriously scholars need to treat her work, and how vital and central she is to our understanding of British Romanticism.” (10)</Text>

            <Text>Reforming the Gothic reader in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads
Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]
Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)
My project filling the gap: Hannah More!
Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.
[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

            <Title>Blanch - Reassessment of Authorship</Title>
            <Text>A Reassessment of the Authorship of the Cheap Repository Tracts Anna Maree Blanch, M.A. 
”At the time of the Repository’s conception in 1794, More’s public profile was that of a playwright and a controversial political commentator, yet, the annals of literary history emphasize her contributions as an educator and religious writer (Brown 32; Yonge Hannah More 463; Philp 67; More Considerations on Religion and Public Education xiv). The Cheap Repository Tracts, a collection of inexpensive moral and religious tracts, are an important factor in the construction of her reputation and the subsequent reception of her work. Indeed, the ‚sublime and immortal‛ Cheap Repository is the primary reason she is considered by some to have been the most prominent woman evangelical campaigner in England between 1780 and 1810 (M. G. Jones 139; Roberts 5; Yonge "Children's Literature of the Last Century" 231).1” (Blanch 1)
“This thesis contends that the extent of Hannah More’s contribution to the Cheap Repository has never been definitively established and that there is a need for clarification of the authorship of individual tracts and bibliographical scholarship relating to the series. This thesis details the current state of bibliographical scholarship as it relates to the Cheap Repository Tracts and identifies those tracts for which authorship can be established conclusively as well as those for which establishing authorship is problematic and must remain inconclusive or unknown. This thesis will also explore the context in which the Cheap Repository Tracts were published and suggest that ascertaining the authorship of individual tracts contributes productively to future criticism of the tracts within their socio-historical, theological and political context. “ (2)
William Roberts was responsible for the first collection of More’s letters published in 1834 and as such heavily influenced the critical reception of More’s biographical life for the next hundred and twenty years. Roberts crafted a version of more through a judicious selection of letters, editing of their contents and general order including dating. See Anne Stott, Hannah More: The First Victorian (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) viii-ix. The accompanying memoir penned by Roberts, and interspersed throughout the four volumes, is filled with his musings and interpretations of the events of Hannah More’s life. For example, Roberts removed criticism of the State and the Church arguably softening the ground for portrayals of More by feminist critics as complicit with the patriarchy. See William Roberts, Memoirs of the Life and Correspondence of Mrs Hannah More, 4th ed., 3 vols. (London: R.B Seeley &amp; W Burnside, 1836). (7)
Volumes of collected Cheap Repository tracts were published in 1798, 1800, 1798, 1799, 1800, 1806, 1818, 1827 and 1839. (Blanch 6)

Scholarly recognition of the lack of clarity regarding the Cheap Repository bibliography, including authorship, dates back to Augustus De Morgan in 1864 (241-45). One of the forefathers on non-traditional authorship attribution, De Morgan was a mathematics professor at London University (S. De Morgan 215-16). (11)
In 1939, G.H. Spinney compiled a bibliography of extant copies of the Cheap Repository tracts, printed by Hazard and Marshall and held by the British Library at that time. He also used the Stationers’ Hall Registers to confirm the date of publication of individual tracts. Although Spinney’s bibliography is often considered authoritative, Mitzi Myers strongly cautions against this confirmatory evaluation (Ford 127; Demers 110; Walker 251; Myers "Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 281, n.9). Spinney’s bibliography is the most comprehensive in terms of discussing the historical context of the relationship between More and the printers of the Cheap Repository. Spinney initially sets the dates for the series at 1795-1798, which are the parameters most commonly repeated by scholars (295). However, Spinney later explains that Hannah More’s day-to- (11)
day involvement with the Hazard and Marshall imprints ended in November, 1797 (295, 307).7 In November, 1797, More appointed Evans and Hatchard as the new publishers (307). Ten months later in September, 1798, More declared the Repository ‚closed,‛ and sold the rights to reprints to Evans, Hatchard and Rivington (Spinney 307-08). From November, 1797, to September, 1798, Evans was the authorized printer the Cheap Repository and was responsible for publishing the ten previously unpublished tracts produced during this period. However, and this is very important, despite being ostensibly sacked in November, 1797, John Marshall continued to sell reprints and publish new tracts under the name of the Cheap Repository, even going to the trouble of entering them under his own name at Stationer’s Hall (308). Seventy-three such tracts were published by Marshall between December, 1797, and November, 1799. (12)
Statements describing Hannah More’s contributions have been repeated by generation after generation of scholars uncontested. The numbers ‚114,‛ for the number of tracts produced between 1795-1798, and ‚50,‛ for Hannah (12)
More’s contributions are repeated ad nauseam. The key quotation which seems to be the source of all subsequent scholarship, is as follows: (13)
Of the 114 different tracts published up to November 1797, 49 bear the initial ‘Z’ and 6 ‘S’. Those signed Z were by Hannah More; those signed S by Sarah More, her sister. The authorship of the ‘Z’ tracts is disclosed in Cadell’s collected edition of Hannah More’s works published in 1818. The statement that ‘S’ tracts were by Sarah More appears in Thompson’s life: he may have it from a private source, though it would not be difficult to guess. We are told in Roberts that the tracts were written by Hannah More with the assistance of her sisters and a few friends. To discover the identity of the ‘few friends’ who between them wrote the remaining 51 is now almost impossible (310).8 (13)
However, the numbers do not add up, and it is not just that the numbers in the quote equal 106, not 114. Spinney’s conclusion specifically states that the count of 114 relates to ‚tracts published up to November, 1797‛ whereas many scholars that cite Spinney’s work and numerical conclusions often substitute an end date of 1798 without clarification or explanation (310). (13)
The lack of particularity in many descriptions of More’s involvement in the Cheap Repository is often the consequence of a heavy reliance on Spinney. Some scholars show explicit deference, such as in the work of Jones (1952), Ford (1996), Smith (1996), and Pharr (1998), which refer to Spinney’s conclusions as to the total number of tracts and More’s contribution. (13)
However, it was over twenty years ago that Mitzi Myers first cautioned against Spinney’s bibliography being considered exhaustive, because it is ‚incomplete‛ ("Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 281, n. 9). In addition to her contention that the Spinney bibliography is ‚incomplete,‛ Myers acknowledges Spinney and Green as the relevant bibliographies, and explains that ‚most, but not all, of the tracts More wrote herself are reprinted in the various editions of her works, as well as in numerous collected editions‛ ("Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 281, n.9). However, Myers does not provide an alternative bibliography or a numerical estimate of More’s contribution, beyond stating that: ‚More contributed almost one-half of the hundred odd pieces‛ ("Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 266).12 Patricia Demers, author of The World of Hannah More (1996), also makes no numerical assertions as to the numbers of tracts or More’s contribution while footnoting Spinney, Jones and Myers (110). (17)
More’s most recent, and efficacious, literary biographer Anne Stott, adroitly describes More as having ‚edit*ed+ the Cheap Repository Tracts‛ and argues that ‚overwhelmingly, the Cheap Repository was *More’s+ creation and her work‛ (178, 338). (18)
Sometimes it appears, at first, that Spinney is not the source relied upon by scholars. However, on further examination it becomes clear that Spinney is in fact the root source for bibliographical claims made about Cheap Repository. For example, Linda Peterson relies on Susan Pederson’s attribution to Hannah More of such tracts as The Riot, The Loyal Sailor; or No Mutineering and Turn the Carpet to Hannah More (410). Susan Pederson in turn describes Hannah More, by Mary Jones, as being her source for the attribution of individual tracts, and specifically for her contention that More wrote ‘over fifty’ of the tracts (85). However, an examination of Jones reveals that she acknowledges Spinney as / her source in her attribution of fifty-one tracts to More. (19-20)

“Fellow bluestocking Mary Russell Mitford also described her as ‚masculine *and+ not in a good sense [...] she [More] writes like a man in petticoats, or a woman in breeches. All her books have a loud voice, and a stern frown, and a long stride‛ (qtd in Myers "'a Peculiar Protection': History, Gender, and Eighteenth Century Literature" 227). Despite the contemporary criticism that More was usurping roles that had traditionally been reserved for men, feminist critics such as Kowaleski-Wallace, Ellen Jordan, Mona Scheurmann, and Eleanor Ty have maligned More as antithetical to the course of social reform and have dismissed her as a passive agent of the patriarchy” (Blanch 87)

            <Text>(1a) I am excited about the ways that distant reading allows the consideration of more works, and thus an expansion of the works under discussion.  I’ll probably make a database trying to combine all the stuff I have, and definitely make a lot of artisanal hand-crafted “small data.
(1b) I am also excited about the recursive reflective process of modelling: the usefulness of making one’s models and their parameters explicit and testing multiple models; the need to actually meaningfully *account for* the full variety of what one is working with, to grapple with and reconcile outliers.”
My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline.
Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all” (McCarty). These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.
“The range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation.” … “Between these two is what seems to me the ideal – a combination, not compromise, of centrifugal freedom and centripetal beholdenness.” (McCarty) 
“digital humanities offers a middle ground or conjectural space within which, data being simply data, the objects of study dear to the humanities may be treated temporarily as if they were objects of nature, like rocks or stars, then the results of that treatment juxtaposed to how we see them and questions asked.” (McCarty)</Text>

            <Text>Project Gutenberg began in 1971 with one individual, Michael Hart, who did not begin with a specific project vision in mind. From the beginning, then, Project Gutenberg was not goal-oriented in the same way as the other resources under discussion. By this I mean that Project Gutenberg orients itself toward goals of a fundamentally different kind than the goals which structure other textual archives, not that it has no goal. Project Gutenberg is, in general, subject to being dismissed as unserious or lacking rigorous standards, but I argue that these dismissals come from a failure to recognize and respect the real goals, seriousness, and standards which drive the project. In the case of the project’s founding, that goal was not, as in the case of the other databases under discussion, to provide a particular kind of access to a particular kind of texts. Instead, the goal of Project Gutenberg was born from a moment of happenstance and nepotism by which Hart, a student at the time, was donated $100,000,000 of computer time on the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the Materials Research Lab at the University of Illinois. This mainframe was one of the first fifteen nodes on the early ARPANet, the precursor to the modern internet. As Hart described it, he “decided there was nothing he could do, in the way of ‘normal computing,’ that would repay the huge value of the computer time he had been given ... so he had to create $100,000,000 worth of value in some other manner” (“History and Philosophy”). Rather presciently for 1971, Hart concluded that the greatest value computing would offer was the storage, searching, and retrieval of other materials. He therefore typed up and distributed the Declaration of Independence. This became the first text of what would eventually become Project Gutenberg. It might even be considered the first ebook (according to Lebert 2008). Project Gutenberg was certainly “the first information provider on the internet and is the oldest digital library” (Lebert).
“During the fist twenty years, Michael Hart himself keyed in the first hundred books, with the occasional help of others from time to time.” (Lebert)
“when we started, the files had to be very small as a normal 300 page book took one meg of space which no one in 1971 could be expected to have (in general). So doing the U.S. Declaration of Independence (only 5K) seemed the best place to start. This was followed by the Bill of Rights — then the whole US Constitution, as space was getting large (at least by the standards of 1973). Then came the Bible, as individual books of the Bible were not that large, then Shakespeare (a play at a time), and then into general work in the areas of light and heavy literature and references.” (Hart “History and Philosophy”) “That edition of Shakespeare was never released, due to copyright changes. If Shakespeare's works belong to the public domain, the comments and notes may be copyrighted, depending on the publication date. But other editions belonging to the public domain were posted a few years later.” (Lebert)</Text>
            <Comments>Later discussion of Project Gutenberg will more fully explore the implications of this textual selection.</Comments>

Ch 1:

For example, the broadsheet ballad ‘Millions be Free: A New Song, Tune—“To Anacreon in Heaven”’, part of the Bodleian ballad collection, was also printed in a less radical version as ‘An Ode on the Restoration, of Freedom to France’ in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in January 1793.30 The broadsheet version of this poem, ‘Millions be Free’, written in the context of the French decree of November 1792 offering ‘fraternity and assistance to all peoples who seek to recover their liberty’31 concludes each stanza by looking forward to the spread of revolutionary ideology with a variant of the couplet—‘While FRANCE rises up, and proclaims the DECREE, | That tears off our Chains, and bids MILLIONS BE FREE’. The ‘Ode’ ends each stanza with ‘That tears off their our chains, and bids millions be free’ (emphasis added), which like its title (‘An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France’) and certain subtle but significant changes in tenses, allows the poem to be read as a celebration of the Revolution in France without the broadsheet’s call for the future spread of revolutionary freedom, The ‘Ode’ version illustrates Michael Scrivener’s argument that ambiguity was a necessary feature of much of the radical verse published in newspapers and magazines, enabling a text to satisfy different factions or ‘sides’ (PR.28–9), whereas the anonymous broadsheet version was able to present a more direct and extreme message. As this suggests, texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration (PR 26). Much war poetry of the period has this dual status; many songs written for a specific occasion were republished in the poetry sections of newspapers and magazines, while new sets of words were published in the hope they would be adopted for such purposes or with the aim that the tune to which they were set would heighten their impact on the reader.32 (p. 10)

The interrelation of the two forms is well illustrated by the republication in the government-controlled newspaper The Star in December 1793 of David Garrick’s two (p.13) inscriptions written to accompany William Hogarth’s pair of prints, The Invasion39 These prints had been published in March 1756, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years War with France, and Garrick’s verses read like a collection, of the clichés of French and English national identity (p. 12-3)

The continued power of ‘The Dram’ during the wars is illustrated by the pro-war, patriotic parody of it. beginning ‘I love that drum’s inspiring sound’, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1804 (BWP 330). Like its republication of ‘The Drum’, the Cambridge Intelligencer’s publication of a sixteen-line extract from a poem by Bielby Porteous, who became Bishop of London in 1787, written when he was a student at Cambridge in 1759, shows how the anti-war sentiment of the opening years of the war drew on the eighteenth-century enlightenment critique of international conflict. Printed under the title ‘The Bishop of London’s Opinion on War’, the lines present a powerful critique of war as the product of kings’ ‘Ambitions’ (p. 16)

Though, probably written in 1791 prior to the outbreak of the war with France,72 Southey published ‘To Horror’ in. Poems (1797), where it becomes an important part of the anti-war strand of that volume (p.24)

 Written in 1797 and published in The Pleasures of Hope in 1799, ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ recounts the journey of ‘Fair Adelaide’ to the banks of the ‘dark-rolling Danube’ in search of her wounded husband, who dies in her arms (ll. 2, 1)77 Campbell removes the gory and gothic elements of Penrose’s original, employing a far more euphemistic language to describe war’s damage … and makes the passion of love and war equally important elements of his hero (p. 26)

Merry’s poem ‘The Wounded Soldier’, written circa 1795 and printed in The Spirit of the Public Journals in 1799, illustrates this fusion of war’s damage to the soldier and to the home in startling fashion (BWP, 242).118 (p. 41)

But the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott. (P. 53)

Ch 3

Southey’s poem was published in January 1799 and the evidence of his Common-Place Book suggests it was written shortly before this, though in later editions he dated it to Westbury 1798, which would mean it could have been written any time after June 1798.6 (p. 82)

            <Title>winnowing down (4 dbs)</Title>
            <Text>Figure &lt;$n#fig:Smith-4dbs-alluvial&gt; shows how Smith’s presence in four major databases has the effect of winnowing down her full output arbitrarily. Even the largest collection, the 42 editions included in the ESTC, is not comprehensive: since the ESTC does not include any works published after 1800, it excludes volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802), three works for children (Conversations, Introducing Poetry, 1804; History of England, 1806; and Natural History of Birds, 1807), and the posthumous publication that now forms a major part of Smith’s reputation as a poet, Beachy Head (1807). ECCO lacks these five editions for the same reason, and is also missing five others: the first and ninth editions of Elegiac Sonnets (1784 and 1800), the second edition of The Banished Man (1795), the first edition of Minor Morals (1798), and the second edition of Rambles Farther (1800).
HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith’s 47 editions, though these are not a simple subset of the ESTC and ECCO. Unlike the ESTC and ECCO, HathiTrust contains volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802). This is the only post-1800 work which appears in HathiTrust, however— the others are also missing, including the important volume Beachy Head (1807). There is one work included in HathiTrust but not in ECCO, the second edition of The Banished Man (1795). Whereas ECCO does not include works unless there is a complete copy available, HathiTrust provides scans of volumes 2, 3, and 4, and simply implies through their numbering that there is a missing first volume — perhaps in the optimism that a volume 1 will appear from another library’s holdings, to complete the set later. The remaining HathiTrust included titles appear in both the ESTC and ECCO, and a further 21 titles appear as facsimiles in ECCO but not in HathiTrust. At first blush it is somewhat surprising that HathiTrust has failed to include works which are, demonstrably, in known locations at institutional libraries, and in physically sound condition to be scanned— but the scans making up HathiTrust bear no relation to the scans in ECCO. The Young Philosopher (1798), for example, appears in ECCO sourced from a British Library copy, but the HathiTrust images are “Google-digitized” from the New York Public Library. Google’s rapacious book-scanning, evidently, was not as thorough as ECCO’s sustained scholarly project.
The smallest subset of all of these texts is the ECCO-TCP holding of just two titles: the second edition of Celestina (1791), and the first edition of The Emigrants (1793). Both titles appear in all larger databases, including HathiTrust (though, as I will discuss, they arrive in HathiTrust from a different source). The Emigrants is included in ECCO-TCP as one file, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the Huntington Library. Celestina is included as four files, one for each of four volumes, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the British Library. Both works were first reproduced in the microfilm version produced 1982-2002 in by Research Publications, then digitized in 2003 (released on ECCO in June 2004), and finally published as TEI XML files in January 2007. The current files have been kept up to date with changes in TEI standards, and were created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl. The bibliographic metadata for these works is the same between ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records. In HathiTrust, however, the source text for The Emigrants is a University of California Library copy, rather than the British Library, scanned by Google Books, and presented with substantially less detailed bibliographic information. The ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records for The Emigrants all provide the same physical description “ix,[3],68[i.e. 60]p. ; 4⁰” with the same note“[n]umbers 9-16 omitted in pagination; text is continuous.” HathiTrust, in contrast, gives the physical description “ix, 68 p. ; 26 cm,” which is both more and less information: a quarto volume could be a range of sizes, so HathiTrust provides new detail by giving a measurement in centimetres, but the data on page numbers is now misleading. Consulting the HathiTrust facsimile shows that it, too, omits the page numbers 9-16, going directly from page 8 to page 17 without a break in the poem. HathiTrust also omits information on the three unnumbered pages between the preface and the poem. Evidently, a human did consult the book, to identify a nine-page preface in roman numerals, and the page number on the last page, but they did not carry out a full collation.</Text>
            <Comments>Why these five?
Volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer are in fact part of the same bibliographic record as the first three volumes. The publication date for the combined five-volume work is listed as “1800-1802.”
Several of HathiTrust’s records provide “mixed copies” like this, with some volumes scanned from one library’s holdings and other volumes scanned at another. If there is overlap, multiple scans will be provided for the duplicated holdings. Nonetheless, all of these scans are tied to a single unified MARC record, taken from only one of the holding library (with no indication of which library provided it).

TO WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ.
DEAR SIR,

THERE is, I hope, some propriety in my addressing a Com|position
to you, which would never perhaps have existed, had
I not, amid the heavy pressure of many sorrows, derived
infinite consolation from your Poetry, and some degree of
animation and of confidence from your esteem.

The following performance is far from aspiring to be con|sidered
as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, "THE
TASK;" I am perfectly sensible, that it belongs not to a
feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Ulysses.

The force, clearness, and sublimity of your admirable Poem;
the felicity, almost peculiar to your genius, of giving to the
most familiar objects dignity and effect, I could never hope to (ECCO-TCP)

Figure &lt;$n#fig:juxta-emigrants-p1&gt; shows how Juxta highlights the words which vary between these three copies.
Both of the OCR copies contain errors in individual letters which render the whole word interpretable by a human but not by text mining software, as in the case of “beavy” for “heavy.” The ECCO copy struggles with the fact that ſ is not an available character, sometimes substituting an f, as in “prefure” for “preſſure.” Both leave out spaces between words, creating new tokens like “isfarfrom” and “andſublimity,” though HathiTrust is less prone to this error.
Other features of the OCR copies are accurate to the page image but would nonetheless interfere with text mining. The hyphenation of “Com- poſition,” for example, would prevent it from rendering as a single word, though here even the careful TCP copy would introduce the same problem, since the line break is encoded as “Com|position.” Before the TCP copy could be used for text mining, the | characters would likely need to be removed — not too different from removing the hyphenation from the ECCO and Hathi copies. Most difficult to resolve is the fact that OCR naturally attempts to capture all text on the page, including the signature mark and catch word. In ECCO these appear as “,a reach” and in Hathi they are “3. - Reach” whereas TCP more appropriately leaves these out. Unlike the problems with hyphenated words, there is no way to correct for the inclusion of catchwords in a document, since there is no predictable way to identify them — but keeping them in the document will cause any text-mining software to count these words twice.
The usual “text cleaning” procedures would further prepare these OCR texts for text mining by transforming all words to lowercase, removing all punctuation, and, in most cases, deleting all words which don’t match a predefined dictionary of valid words. A scholar working with the HathiTrust OCR would almost certainly add to this a step converting the ſ character to an s, as discussed above, in order to make the dictionary comparison feasible. The result of this ‘cleaning’ would likely look something like the following:

to william dear sir there is i hope some propriety in my a potion to you which would never perhaps have existed had i not amid the heavy of many sorrows derived infinite consolation from your poetry and some degree of animation and of your he following performance aspiring to be con as an imitation of your inimitable poem the task i am sensible that it belongs not to a feeble hand to draw the bow of clearness and sublimity admirable poem the felicity almost peculiar to your genius of the familiar dignity and i could never hope to a reach (ECCO, as it would likely appear after text “cleaning”)

Strikingly, these ‘clean’ texts are now further from legible to human eyes, as OCR errors which a reader could mentally correct (such as “beavy” for “heavy” are now entirely removed.</Text>

            <Title>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London</Title>
            <Text>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London Stage, 1789–1805 (2000), follows the same general line of argument. Taylor shows that although smaller theatres had been able to avoid the Lord Chamberlain’s restrictions at the time the Revolution broke out, and had therefore been able to exhibit some enthusiastic dramatisations of events in Paris, censorship was quickly imposed across all London theatres. This forced engagement with the Revolution to become more covert. Censorship meant that British radical writers ‘had to relinquish the theatre as a means of rational instruction’, and political comment was forced into seemingly unlikely theatrical modes: musical entertainments, pantomimes, and above all a new offshoot of the gothic, the melodrama (99). Throughout the 1790s, Taylor argues, political anxieties and hopes were represented by metaphor, images of imprisonment, blindness or dispossession being routinely employed as veiled but recognisable references to current events.

            <Text>In 2000, Distributed Proofreaders was founded. Also “In 2000, a non-profit corporation, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was chartered in Mississippi, United States to handle the project's legal needs. Donations to it are tax-deductible. Long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer Gregory Newby became the foundation's first CEO.” (Wikipedia)
“A fast growth thanks to Distributed Proofreaders, a website launched in October 2000 by Charles Franks to share the proofreading of books between many volunteers. Volunteers choose one of the books listed on the site and proofread a given page. They don't have any quota to fulfill, but it is recommended they do a page per day if possible. It doesn't seem much, but with hundreds of volunteers it really adds up.” (Lebert)
“In 2002 Distributed Proofreaders became part of Project Gutenberg.” (Hosch) “By 2009 roughly half of all Project Gutenberg books had been handled by using Distributed Proofreaders.” (Hosch)
“As of 2018, the 36,000+ DP-contributed books comprised almost two-thirds of the nearly 60,000 books in Project Gutenberg.” (Wikipedia)

At some point Carnegie Mellon University agreed to administer the project’s finances.
It’s currently hosted by ibiblio at UNC Chapel Hill.

”The number of electronic books rose from 1,000 (in August 1997) to 5,000 (in April 2002), 10,000 (in October 2003), 15,000 (in January 2005), 20,000 (in December 2006) and 25,000 (in April 2008). … The steady growth went on, with an average of 8 books per month in 1994, 16 books per month in 1995, and 32 books per month in 1996.” (Lebert) “If 32 years were necessary to digitize the first 10,000 books, between July 1971 and October 2003, 3 years and 2 months were necessary to digitize the following 10,000 books, between October 2003 and December 2006.” (Lebert) “In the first 11 weeks of 2004, Project Gutenberg added 313 new e-books. It took from 1971 to 1997 to produce the first 313 e-books—that's 11 weeks compared to about 26 years.” (Hane)
“In 2004 Project Gutenberg Europe and Distributed Proofreaders Europe were formed to facilitate the process of adding more non-English works.” (Hosch)
The books doubled again between 2006 and 2011, from 20,000 (2006) to 40,000 (2011). (Hosch)
The current collection is 60,000 ebooks. This falls short of Hart’s bombastic declaration in 2004 that “We want to grow the collection to 1 million free e-books and distribute them to 1 billion people for a total of 1 quadrillion e-books to be given away by the end of the year 2015.” (Hane)

Wikipedia: ”In August 2003, Project Gutenberg created a CD containing approximately 600 of the "best" e-books from the collection. The CD is available for download as an ISO image. When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge.
“PG has been giving away CDs and DVDs; a volunteer mails them out for free on request.” (Hane)
In December 2003, a DVD was created containing nearly 10,000 items. At the time, this represented almost the entire collection. In early 2004, the DVD also became available by mail.
In July 2007, a new edition of the DVD was released containing over 17,000 books, and in April 2010, a dual-layer DVD was released, containing nearly 30,000 items.
The majority of the DVDs, and all of the CDs mailed by the project, were recorded on recordable media by volunteers. However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them. As of October 2010, the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs.</Text>

            <Text>Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.</Text>

            <Title>what I'm doing here</Title>
            <Text>The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus is not without grounds. As this dissertation will explore in depth, challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new “great unread.” Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. For example, the English Short Title Catalogue records 51,965 titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799. The corpus most commonly used for DH work on eighteenth-century literature, ECCO-TCP, includes only 466 titles for that same time period. What are the other 51,499 titles, why are they accessible in the ways they are, and what does it mean for digital eighteenth-century studies that they are not included? Although the examination of databases prompts similar hypotheses of exclusion as in longstanding conversations about canons, digital databases do not simply replicate new canons. [By the end of my dissertation, I will be able to state here what IS happening — something structured by related logics of access and prestige, and related simplifications of historical complexity, and related institutional replication of privileged texts.. But very importantly different, too, since we don’t read databases.] In a series of computational and non-computational research processes, I examine six databases of eighteenth-century texts to learn about four eighteenth-century authors, and I examine four eighteenth-century authors to learn about eighteenth-century databases. This dissertation, therefore, takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth-century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship shaping my frameworks, and then introduce my chapters by introducing my four case study authors.</Text>

            <Text>“Because typically created from existing analog collections, digital ones can grow at the faster rate of digitization than manual collection. Database and interface features can be renovated more quickly than physical infrastructure; even if development is lengthy, when changes are implemented, for the end user they take effect instantaneously. Crowd-sourced corrections—a celebrated feature of Trove’s newspaper collection—mean that searchable text can change even when the number of digitized documents remains constant.” (213)

“For instance, to the (supplied) question “What does the collection cover?” the British Newspaper Archive answers, “The British Library’s newspaperPage 216 → collections are among the finest in the world, containing most of the runs of newspapers published in the UK since 1800” (findmypast, “About the British Newspaper Archive,” britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/help/about). Conflating the cultural institution’s analog holdings with the commercial organization’s digital ones, this reply obscures the nature and scope of the digital collection while denying the existence of gaps between historical and digital records.” (215-216)

“Feminist literary historians have extensively debated whether men or women were more likely to use opposite sex pseudonyms. Some argue that women were more likely to use male pen names to avoid either the shame associated with middle- and upper-class women earning a living by writing fiction and/or the nineteenth-century perception of “women novelists . . . as inferior to male writers” (Casey n6; see also Sutherland 156, 159–60). Others propose that men were more likely to use female pseudonyms due to the nineteenth-century view of fiction authorship as feminized (Judd 82; Tuchman with Fortin 53). Among the colonial newspaper fiction identified in this project, titles by known male authors were inscribed as “female” only seven times, compared with eighty-one cases where the opposite occurs.” (218)

“The claim that nineteenth-century men and women wrote distinct types of fiction is foundational to much twentieth-century feminist literary scholarship (for example, S. Gilbert and Gubar; P. Gilbert). Numerous stylometry projects focus on distinguishing male and female authors based on word frequencies (for example, Olsen; Rybicki).” (225)


To follow up on:
“On the limitations of bibliographical records for quantitative analysis, see Elliot.”

“Folsom’s essay on database as a new genre also associates digital technologies with comprehensive and direct access to the literary-historical record, even as the resource he refers to—The Walt Whitman Archive (whitmanarchive.org/)—enacts a carefully historicized approach to the documentary record. Responses to this essay, including by Freedman and by McGann (“Database”), represent early rejections of this paradigm of transparency in digital humanities.”

“Shillingsburg offers an accessible account of the shift in scholarly editing from an archetypal to a historical and material approach (167–68) and of the distinctions between the implied, represented, and interpreted work (170–81).”

“Humanities scholars have long recognized archives as manifesting structures of authority rather than as neutral containers; see Manoff for a concise summary of this extensive debate.”

            <Text>“Having begun as an actress, courtesan and fashion icon, she broke onto the late eighteenth-century literary scene first as that embodiment of sensibility, a Della Cruscan poet. Forging conversation through her writing, she proceeded to make herself a central literary figure of the 1790s, creating authorial identities inextricably linked with other Romantic writers. A prolific writer and increasingly radical thinker, she published in the last ten years of her life four verse collections, six individual long poems, a sonnet sequence, seven novels, two plays, a translation, three political essays, hundreds of poems for different / newspapers and a draft of her memoirs.” (Cross 1-2)

“Susan Luther, Stuart Curran, Judith Pascoe, Eleanor Ty and  Sharon  Setzer  in  the  mid-1990s  launched  an  intense  period  of  scholarly  work  on  Robinson.  Highlighting  Robinson’s  writing  “as  a  kind  of  cultural  barometer  of  aesthetic  changes  [that]  initiate[s]  or  engage[s]  in  her  society’s  every  literary  preoccupation”  (20),  Pascoe’s  groundbreaking  Romantic Theatricality  (1997),  in  particular,  situated  Robinson’s  pseudonymous  theatrical  writing  at  the  center  of  late  eighteenth-century  literary  culture.19 Since then, Robinson’s performativity has been the dominant lens through which her writing and her career have been interpreted. According to Pascoe, Robinson enacted in her writing an ever-shifting public identity, a “fluid theatricality” (9) that was both her trademark and an embodiment of “theatrical modes of representation” (7) that were constitutive of Romantic authorial identity. The theater provided the “central vehicle” for her multiple transformations beyond the stage, supplying “an identifiable collection of practices  at  once  portable  and  applicable  to  other  cultural  areas”  (Gamer  and T. Robinson 220). These other areas include her interaction with other Romantic poets, the other primary lens for interpreting Robinson’s writing, in particular her relations with Coleridge and the Della Cruscans, to a lesser extent Wordsworth and, more recently, Southey and Smith.” (Cross 6)
“I seek to combine these two approaches, taking a cue from Daniel Robinson’s The  Poetry  of  Mary  Robinson:  Form  and  Fame  (2011),  which  argues  for  Robinson’s obsession with “social interaction and literary intertextuality ... [as a means] to achieve professional legitimacy, recognition and fame” (8) as an author, and which minutely traces the web of networks that Robinson created  through  her  pseudonymous  poetics  and  her  formal  virtuosity.  Rather  than  focusing  on  Robinson’s  “avatars,”  this  book  foregrounds  her / professional and sympathetic engagements with specific writers; it is here, I contend, that she constructed her literary reputation. Self-inventive as they are, these exchanges remained singular and distinct from one another rather than constituting a network. They were addressed to particular individuals and were as much about intimacy and sympathetic exchange as they were about performativity. Indeed, it is the combination of these properties in her allusive exchanges—seemingly private yet meant to be public (rather than the private made public)—that distinguishes her dialogues. By interanimat-ing  subject  and  object,  speaker  and  interlocutor,  these  dialogues  produce  mutual obligations that simultaneously authorize self and other. In the pro-cess, they reveal a writer who could only, paradoxically, achieve an authorial identity through conversation with others.” (6-7)

Dialogue  is,  of  course,  performative,  and  Robinson’s  exchanges  are  especially  so.  As  Michael  Gamer  and  Terry  Robinson  have  argued,  Mary  Robinson  exploited  the  parallels  between  dramatic  and  textual  spaces  by  transporting theatre’s “mode of allusive practice” from the theatre into the many  other  public  arenas  in  which  she  participated  (254).  But  dialogue,  especially written dialogue, is also a different kind of performance from the theater  because  of  the  intertextuality  of  the  exchange.  It  shifts  the  visual,  public  dynamic  of  the  theater  to  the  more  private  realm  of  textuality  in  which surface and depth, self and other become blurred.  (Cross 7)

Most commentators on Robinson’s literary production have focused on individual texts—either her poetry or fiction, not both—and followed the responses of her reviewers, reading the poetry as better crafted, a serious bid for literary reputation in a masculine tradition, and the novels as hastily produced, a matter of economic exigency and part of women’s feminizing dominance of the fiction market. See, for example, the reviews of Walsingham and D. Robinson, Poetry (11–12). (Cross 12)

The  publication  of  the  eight-volume  complete  Works  by  Mary  Robinson  by  Pickering  and  Chatto  (2009–2010),  under  the  direction  of  William  Brewer,  marked  Robinson’s  official  reentrance  into  the  literary  canon.  All  citations  of  Robinson’s work will be from this edition unless indicated otherwise and will be cited as M RW by volume and page. Robinson’s writing is also available in individual editions by Broadview and Oxford, as well as others, and online at Romantic Circles. There are three recent biographies Byrne (2004), Davenport (2006) and Gristwood (2005). See also Bass, The Green Dragoon. (Cross 12)

While  Robinson’s  biography  has  produced  interpretations  of  her  as  celebrity  or  fallen  woman,  audacious  or  meretricious,  her  authorship  has  led  to  inter-pretations  that  portray  her  as  a  Sapphic  poet  of  sensibility  (McGann,  Poetics of Sensibility [ch.10]), a revolutionary novelist (Garnai, Revolutionary), and a radical polemicist, fighting for the rights of man and woman (Hodson). These representations  have  also  been  qualified  by  attention  to  her  disdain  for  other  women writers and her sympathy for the Prince of Wales (D. Robinson). (Cross 13)

“Scholarship  on  Robinson  has  proliferated  since  Pascoe’s  study  and  has  been  wide-ranging  in  scope,  including  further  studies  analyzing  her  performative  subjectivity and her chameleonic self-fashioning; her position as a woman writer within  late  eighteenth-century  culture;  her  urban  focus;  her  adaptations  of different genres, including the sonnet, ode, lyric, romance and the gothic novel; her relationships with specific writers, primarily poets, especially Coleridge; and her radical politics, as well as essays offering pedagogical strategies and tracing publication  history.  On  her  performative  subjectivity  and  her  chameleonic  self-fashioning  more  generally,  see  Gamer  and  T.  Robinson;  Mellor,  “Making  an  Exhibition”;  Pascoe,  Romantic Theatricality. Specific  angles  on  this  theme  include  attention  to  Robinson’s  celebrity  status  (Brock,  Mole);  masquerade  (Cullen, Sigler); fashion (Fay); her portraits (Anca, Munteanu); her use of pseudonyms (Pascoe, Wilson); cross-dressing (Binhammer, “Female Homosociality”; Shaffer,  “Gender,  Pain”  and  “Cross-Dressing”;  Setzer,  “The  Dying  Game”);  her  acting  career  (Barbour,  “Garrick’s  Version”;  Eger);  sylphs  (Labbe,  “Mary  Robinson’s Sylphid Self”); and polygraphs (Brewer, “Subverting Individuality”). On her position as a woman writer within late-eighteenth-century culture, see especially Labbe, “Selling One’s Sorrows”; Mellor; Miskolcze; Peterson; Ty.

            <Text>The Early Novels Database (END) project generates high-quality metadata about novels published between 1660 and 1850 in order to make early works of fiction more available to both traditional and computational modes of humanistic study. By uniting twenty-first-century database and search technologies with the sensibility of eighteenth-century indexing practices, END creates several innovative access points to a dataset that currently includes over two thousand richly detailed records. END metadata records and encodes information about how early novels instruct readers about themselves, carefully noting prefaces, introductions, and dedications; tables of contents and indexes; full titles and footnotes buried deep within the text. Each record includes both discursive descriptions of copy-specific information and codified languages that enable nimble search.  
END is a collaborative, multi-institutional project based at the University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College. Begun in 2009 by co-PIs Rachel Buurma, Associate Professor of English Literature at Swarthmore, and Jon Shaw, Director of Logistics and Access Services at Penn Libraries, the END project has expanded to include faculty, staff, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from both institutions, as well as undergraduate researchers from Penn, the Tri-College Consortium (Swarthmore, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr), and LACOL (Liberal Arts Consortium for Online Learning) member institutions.  
While most END cataloging to date has been based at Penn Libraries’ Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, which has strong holdings in British and American fiction of the long eighteenth century, END has also cataloged early novels at a number of Philadelphia-area repositories (the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach Museum and Library, the Swarthmore Libraries Rare Book Room, and Bryn Mawr College Special Collections) as well as the Fales Library at New York University.</Text>

            <Title>McLaverty - Poems in print</Title>
            <Text>Abstract and Keywords
This chapter argues that relations between poetry and print in this period were uneasy. Poetry looked for freedom and expressivity; the book trade looked for a profit. But the consequence was a wonderfully varied output. Typography could be elaborate or chaste; format varied between the poles of dignity (the illustrated folio) and humility (the freely given-away slip); “topping” booksellers developed alongside the Grub Street trade and provincial rivals or collaborators. It was the period in which English poetry achieved classic status, with a consequent stability and longevity but also with an impetus toward authorial revision.
Keywords: poetry, print culture, typography, format, book trade, canon
The relationship between print and poetry in the period from Paradise Lost to Lyrical Ballads was an uneasy one. On poetry’s side, the link with a vocal performance and with the freedom and expressivity of manuscript circulation was still strong, and it was accompanied by a deep mistrust of compromise with the commercial demands of print.1 On print’s side, poetry was always going to be troublesome, because its frequent brevity and persistent demands on paper created difficulties in shaping it into something saleable. Prestige attached itself to the publication of great poems, but reference books, religious and political controversy, plays, and, late in the period, novels were a better financial bet. The sheer awkwardness of this relationship, however, generated a period of diversity and experiment.
What could be done to represent the human voice through the resources of the compositor’s case was tried, though it risked charges of diseconomy and inelegance. The beauties of manuscript publication were mimicked in large illustrated and ornamented quartos and folios, while some of its casualness was echoed in slips and half-sheets. In a counter move, poems played with the bookishness of their embodiment, toying with the dignity of the Bible or the classical variorum, or with the antique in the form of prophecy or medieval lyrics. The book trade’s most significant innovation, alongside the magazine and the miscellany, was to make the poetry book a luxury item, paying its way by using up more and better paper than it strictly needed in order to command a higher price. Although this practice moderated in the course of the century, it remained an influence in poetry publication, as it does today. As Roger Lonsdale notes in his pioneering New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse, late in the century booksellers turned poems themselves into vast reference collections, anthologizing the age’s verse and deciding which authors merited reprinting.2 My account will follow the eighteenth-century editors’ lead and, with some exceptions, focus on the poetry that they were already making canonical.3 (40)

Format
A striking aspect of poems in print in this period is that they appeared in so many different shapes and sizes. The question of suitable format for poems was unsettled. In a period when histories were published in quarto or folio, it is no surprise that collections of verse should appear in large formats, but that a large number of individual poems should be published in folio is surprising to the modern reader, as is the balancing publication of occasional and polemical poems in slips and half-sheets. Searching the ESTC provides a general picture for the eighteenth century.13 The smallest size used regularly was an eighth of a sheet, or the equivalent of one leaf of an octavo. There are few of these, and I suspect they were often given away—for example, a song from the theater where Henry Carey’s Honest Yorkshire Man (p. 45) was being performed—but there are more ¼os, where Foxon distinguishes between regular quarter-sheets and slips, which were printed in four columns parallel with the short side of the sheet and commonly used for songs. These constitute around 2.5 percent of the total. The really popular format for short pieces, generally occasional, was the half-sheet, the equivalent of a folio leaf but issued on its own, unfolded. In the early decades of the century this format rivaled the folio and quarto for popularity at 13–15 percent of the total, but it dropped off later; the figure for the century is around 7.5 percent. Folios were high in importance in the early decades of the century, rising to 30 percent of the total in the 1730s, but they too fell away very rapidly after 1750 and for the final three decades barely amount to 2 percent. Quartos performed much more steadily, constituting 33 percent of the output overall and rising to more than 50 percent in the 1760s and 1770s, when they started to dominate the luxury book market. Octavos too were popular throughout the century, making up around 45 percent in total. They far outstripped duodecimos, which were very unpopular for poems in the early period, when they struggled to make 5 percent (44-45)

Sales
The popularity of large formats in the early eighteenth century doubtless reflects a desire for dignity, but another important reason for their prevalence was commercial. As David Foxon says of Pope’s folio Windsor-Forest and Ode for Musick, they were printed in “a format which would justify a price sufficient to make a profit—one shilling for Windsor Forest in five sheets, 6d. for the Ode in three.”15 The basic problem was that demand for poetry was relatively low. Even poems that enjoyed critical esteem did not have big sales. The first edition of a poem by Pope could be expected to sell 2,000 copies, and those not necessarily all at once. Woodfall’s ledgers show him printing 2,000 copies of the First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace (1737), with 150 fine-paper copies in addition, while Bowyer printed only 2,000 copies of the New Dunciad (1742), which might have been expected to be a bestseller.16 And I don’t think Pope sold badly. Bowyer printed 2,000 copies of Gray’s Trivia, with 250 fine, in January 1716 and needed to print only 1,000 of the second edition in June. William Somervile’s The Chace was a popular success, running to eight editions between 1735 and 1749, but the first edition, printed by Bowyer, was a quarto of only 750 copies, with an additional 500 on royal paper, while the second edition dropped to octavo and was of 1,000 copies; only the third, again octavo, at 1,500 suggests marked success. The fourth authorized edition was not needed until 1743, and consisted of only 500 copies.17 It is worth (p. 47) noting that the sale of 6,000 copies of the octavo Rape of the Lock in six weeks was regarded as a phenomenal success. (46-47)
The Luxury Poetry Book
The credit for moving poetry to the luxury end of the book market, if it is credit, must go to Jacob Tonson, Sr. He saw that the bookseller’s financial problems could be solved not by printing as cheaply as possible, but by printing elegantly and charging a higher price.
Tonson’s influence on the poetry book can be seen by comparing the first edition of Paradise Lost of 1667 with his edition of 1688. The first edition is printed without fuss, as though the poem is a slightly extravagant form of prose. The format is quarto, with the type set solid. Rules are used to surround the text tightly, with boxes to the upper and outer margins. The impression is of a religious text; the presentation, though without black letter and double columns, is not unlike that of the King James Bible.19 Tonson’s 1688 edition, undertaken jointly with Richard Bentley, is altogether more spacious, with Milton beginning to (p. 48) be treated as a classic. The edition was marketed by subscription, a fusion of patronage and publication; in buying the book in advance you supported it with cash and with your name. The 1688 Paradise Lost is a folio in fours, much more spacious than the quarto first edition, and it is illustrated. (47-48)
Conclusion
The most remarkable aspect of poems in print in this period is their sheer variety, and it is worth noting in conclusion how much poems differed in themselves. Print might be expected to have the effect of stabilizing poetic texts, but it has its own inbuilt tendency toward variation.30 Even if stop-press correction, prevalent in the early period, is put aside, there are opportunities for change through later editions, the correction and expansion of existing works, and the addition of introductory and explanatory apparatus. The initiative for such changes may often come from the author, but the book trade clearly has an interest in generating new copy and new sales. (53)

            <Text>Contemporaneous with the standing army controversy of the late 1690s was a remarkable campaign of republication of earlier texts, and of textual manipulation, which bequeathed ‘commonwealth’ handbooks to the com- ing century, and established what became a hackneyed canon of political high virtue. This was chiefly the work of the prolific Toland. The Whig martyr Algernon Sidney’s Discourses concerning Government, for which he had been executed in 1683, appeared in 1698; the Works of John Milton came out in 1699; those of the republican James Harrington in 1700. In a shrewd piece of editorial revision, Toland transformed the tone of Colonel Edmund Ludlow’s Civil War Memoirs, written in the 1660s, and published in 1698, softening Ludlow’s militant godly zeal into a secular moralism more suited to Enlightenment sensibilities. To take just one instance of Toland’s tech- nique, a hero of the Civil Wars who in the original manuscript went to his execution like ‘a lamb of Christ’, in the printed edition ‘died like a Roman’ (Worden 1978, 2001). </Text>

            <Text>”subject heading assignment is pragmatic and heuristic rather than an exercise in truth and accuracy. …normally the question to be asked is whether they are good or bad, helpful or irrelevant, rather than true (accurate) or false (incorrect). The assignment of subject headings cannot and need not conform to the same standards that apply to descriptive bibliography in the tradition of W. W. Greg and Fredson Bowers. What descriptive accuracy is to cataloging and bibliography, consistency is to the assignment of subject headings.” (Garrett 69)

“While the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) contains Library of Congress Subject Headings (hereafter: LCSH) for books from the English-speaking world printed before 1701, entries for material dating from 1701 to 1800 are not subject indexed.” (Garrett 70)
“An already difficult situation has been aggravated recently by the sudden (and otherwise hugely welcome) availability of a new and mammoth library of searchable eighteenth-century text online through Thomson Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).” (Garrett 70)
“Northwestern harvested records from WorldCat containing subject headings for eighteenth-century titles in ECCO.” (Garrett 71)
They found that roughly 60% of the material located in a search for “East India Trading Company” was only found due to the subject headings, and would not have been found by a simple keyword search. (Garrett 73-4)
“Shortly after completion of this manuscript, The British Library announced that it intended to add LCSH to all 18th-century records in the ESTC by autumn 2007. The subject headings extracted by Northwestern from the WorldCat database will constitute an important part of this enhancement project.” (Garrett 77)</Text>

            <Text>“The most interesting question raised by the debate is not the familiar one of which texts or authors will be included in the literary canon, but the question of why the debate represents a crisis in literary study.” (Vii)
“I will argue that evaluative judgments are the necessary but not sufficient condition for the process of canon formation, and that it is only by understanding the social function and institutional protocols of the school that we will understand how works are preserved, reproduced, and disseminated over successive generations and centuries. Similarly, where the debate speaks about the canon as representing or failing to represent particular social groups, I will speak of the school's historical function of distributing, or regulating access to, the forms of cultural capital.” (Vii)
“while the debate seems to its participants to be about the contents of the literary canon, its significance goes well beyond the effects of any new consensus about a truly "representative" canon. The canon debate signifies nothing less than a crisis in the form of cultural capital we call "literature."” (Viii)
“The theory of cultural capital implies that the proper social context for analyzing the school and its literary curriculum is class.” (Viii)
“If there exists a form of capital which is specifically symbolic or cultural, the production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of this capital presupposes the division of society into groups that can be called classes. Bourdieu's sociology assumes such a division, but it does not assume that an economic account of classes is sufficient in itself.1 Such an account would omit precisely what in Bourdieu's theory is "cultural."” (Viii)
“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)
“By foregrounding the question of the relation between social groups and the means of literary production, I have thus attempted to resist the easy assumption that whatever one says about race and gender goes without saying for class too.” (Ix)
“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The "means" in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)
“The literary syllabus is the institutional form by means of which this knowledge is disseminated, and it constitutes capital in two senses: First, it is linguistic capital, the means by which one attains to a socially credentialed and therefore valued speech” (ix)
“And second, it is symbolic capital, a kind of knowledge-capital whose possession can be displayed upon request and which thereby entitles its possessor to the cultural and material rewards of the well-educated person.” (Ix)
““I regard these two kinds of capital as ultimately more socially significant in their effects than the "ideological" content of literary works, a content which the critics of the canon see as reinforcing the exclusion of minority authors from the canon by expressing the same values which determine exclusionary judgments. Literary works must be seen rather as the vector of ideological notions which do not inhere in the works themselves but in the context of their institutional presentation, or more simply, in the way in which they are taught.”” (Ix)
“That category organizes the literary curriculum in such a way as to create the illusion of a fixed and exclusive ‘canon,’ an illusion which is belied by the real history of literary curricula in the schools.” (X)
““calling the canon into question has failed to inaugurate a historico-critical inquiry into the category of literature, even while it has registered a crisis in the cultural capital so denominated”” (x)
“The context of the first case study is the institution of a vernacular literary curriculum in the primary schools of the eighteenth century.” (X)
“the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel. Wordsworth and Coleridge responded to this crisis with a programmatic attempt to reaffirm the High Cultural status of traditional canonical works in English against, on the one hand, popular novels and narrative poetry, and, on the other, the quasi-Latinate "poetic diction" supposed to have characterized especially the work of Gray. The effect of that program, which was of course shared by a literary culture much larger than the circle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was to reserve the term "literature" for High Canonical works, and in this way to maintain the cultural capital of those works.”” (Xi)
“an account of the emergence of literary study such as that provided by Gerald Graff in his invaluable Professing English.” (Xi)
“I have constructed the second case study around a moment in which the vernacular curriculum in the university became strongly distinguished from the curriculum in the primary and secondary levels. This was the moment of the great canonical reformation of the New Critics.” (Xi) - Chapter 3
“Chapter 4 turns to the highest level of the educational system, the graduate school, where in the last twenty-five years the literary syllabus has been supplemented by a list of texts which effectively circulate as a "canon of theory."” (Xii)
“The fact that today we so easily recognize the names of the master theorists confirms the emergence of these names as a "canon" supplementing the canon of literature in the graduate schools, and testifies to the perceived inadequacy of the / literary syllabus to constitute a program of study complete in itself.” (xii - xiii)
“attempt to redirect the focus of the debate away from the question of who is in or out of the canon to the question of the canonical form in its social and institutional contexts” (xiii)
“The form we call "literature" organizes the syllabus and determines criteria of selection much more directly than the particular social biases of judgment which have been invoked to explain the canonical or noncanonical status of particular authors.” (Xiii)
“In the final chapter of this book I argue that the extrapolation of a critique of aesthetics from the critique of the canon is mistaken in its fundamental premise.” (Xiii)
“The value-concept has a history of which the canon debate remains unaware, and which needs to be recovered before one sets out to critique the concept of a specifically "aesthetic" value. I proceed in Chapter 5 to reconstruct the historical relation between aesthetics and political economy in order to demonstrate the origin of the value-concept in the struggle to distinguish the work of art from the commodity.” (Xiii)
“the production and distribution of cultural works as cultural capital cannot be explained by making no distinction between cultural and material capital.” (Xiv)
“the specificity of aesthetic judgment is not on this view simply an illusion to be exploded, but rather a privileged site for reimagining the relation between the cultural and the economic in social life.” (Xiv)
“The strangest consequence of the canon debate has surely been the discrediting of judgment, as though human beings could ever refrain from judging the things they make.” (Xiv)
“The most politically strategic argument for revising the canon remains the argument that the works so revalued are important and valuable cultural works. If literary critics are not yet in a position to recognize the inevitability of the social practice of judgment, that is a measure of how far the critique of the canon still is from developing a sociology of judgment. The theory of cultural capital elaborated in this book is an attempt to construct just such a sociology.” (Xiv)

Footnotes
“The concept of class is as controverted as any other notion in social theory, and the class analysis I propose in this book will not wait for any definitive resolution of that controversy. Here I can only point to the larger features on the map in order to situate my own analysis (and Bourdieu's) in something like a region of this domain. For Marx and Marxism, class is defined by position in the relations of production, and there are only two of these: capital and labor; alternatively, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (the existence of a "petty bourgeoisie" does not alter the dualism of this structure). The rigor of this model, which apprehends class distinction in eco- nomic terms, leaves largely unresolved the question of how cultural distinctions are articulated on the template of the capital-labor structure. The solution to this prob- lem is ultimately what is at stake in every class analysis, including Bourdieu's. For the tradition of "bourgeois" sociology (Durkheim and Weber are as important in Bourdieu's theory as the work of Marx), class is primarily a cultural concept, al- though the expression of many cultural class traits will in practice depend on mate- rial resources. With the concept of"cultural capital" Bourdieu undertakes a certain negotiation between the domains of the economy and culture. Without pronounc- ing on the success of this negotiation, I would insist here that the aporia between the cultural and the economic is the most fundamental problem confronted by bour- geois sociology, as well as by that hypothetical "Marxist" sociology which Marx himself never produced. For Bourdieu's own account of the concept of capital, see "The Forms of Capital," in The Handbook of Theory and Research for the Soci- ology of Education, ed. John G. Richardson (New York: Greenweed Press, 1983), 241-58. Rather than offer here a precise definition of cultural capital, I have fol- lowed Bourdieu's own practice in constructing the concept through the contexts of its deployment.” (341)
“The concept ofthe "New Class" invokes Alvin Gouldner, The Future ofIntellec- tuals and the Rise of the New Class (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979). The "professional-managerial class" invokes the groundbreaking essay of Barbara and John Ehrenreich, "The Professional-Managerial Class," in Between Labor and / Capital, ed. Pat Walker (Montreal: Black Rose Press, 1979). The controversy in the Walker volume over the question of whether the group of professional-managerial workers constitutes a class is scarcely settled in that volume. The Ehrenreichs pro- ceed on the assumption that a class has both an economic and a cultural compo- nent, neither of which can be simply derived from, or reduced to, the other. This working assumption makes for a less than tidy theory of class, but the Ehrenreichs are not especially disturbed by this untidiness. Gouldner's conception of cultural capital casts the New Class in the role of a new bourgeoisie, the historical suc- cessors to t~eold. I have kept Gouldner's theory in mind, somewhat warily, prefer- ring Bourdieu's less narrativizing mode of class analysis. For the more limited purposes of the argument I wish to make in this book, it perhaps does not matter whether the professional-managerial classes are conceived to be a distinct class, or, as Erik Olin Wright argues in his response to the Ehrenreichs in the Walker volume, a "contradictory location within class relations" (203). What matters to the present argument is that the emergence of the professional-managerial class has enor- mously altered the constitution and distribution of cultural capital in the school system, and that these new conditions remain the unremarked horizon of the canon debate.” (341-342)

            <Text>My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair’s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer’s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the “parade of authors” and “parliament of texts” models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the “footprint” left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski’s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “resonance,” which takes Brewer’s “footprint” as the primary object of study to trace the “busy afterlife of the literary artifact” which “refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.” This “busy afterlife” can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work’s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. </Text>

            <Title>why 1790s?</Title>
            <Text>Some limiting factor was necessary to make this project feasible from a technical standpoint. I needed to define a small enough scope that I could attempt something like comprehensiveness within that scope. I also knew that for many of the databases I wanted to use, I would not be able to access their full records, but samples of up to roughly 50,000 records had been given to other scholars (based on other papers I saw people publish on the ESTC). I decided that roughly a decade would give me enough texts to be worth approaching in this way, but not more texts than I could handle.
I narrowed my focus to England as a way to sidestep problems of metadata. The Ireland of the eighteenth century had an unstable and contested relationship with the United Kingdom: how is this addressed by metadata assigning countries to texts? Is something tagged as “UK” if the city is in the UK now, or if it was in the UK at the time? I assume now. I decided not to open this can of worms! “Future Work.” Narrowing to England also helps to reduce the number of texts being considered. I’m disappointed that this means excluding all those Scottish pirated editions. Additional Future Work could compare Scotland to England, or grapple with Ireland.
Once I decided to pick roughly a decade, I picked the 1790s for a couple reasons. I began in the eighteenth century as a Gothicist, and remain curious about how the Gothic might relate to its print context: choosing a decade that was important to the Gothic opened up the possibility that my ultimate findings would be Gothic-related. The 1790s were also just a generally exciting decade, as there was a massive expansion of print, and a massive cultural anxiety about the role of print in peoples’ lives. The nature of the project meant that I had to pick my decade before I really knew what to find in it: the heightened revolutionary stakes of this particular decade seemed to give me the best chance that the decade would have something interesting in it. It’s also an important decade for the eighteenth century texts which would later become canonical, namely, the origins of Romanticism.</Text>

            <Title>popular / normal</Title>
            <Text>The meaning of “popular” shifts depending on what is conceived of as its “opposite.” Is it an aesthetic category, popular vs highbrow, Gothic novel vs poetry? Is is a sociological/economic term, popular vs elite, ballads and chapbooks vs books? Is it tied to reception, popular vs unpopular, Udolpho vs The Two Emilys? Or tied to legacy, popular vs forgotten, Lyrical Ballads vs The Lemon? I am interested in all of these varying definitions of popularity because they are all tied to what actually interests me, an attempt to define and characterize “normal.”
Literary study is typically interested in outliers, because they are, well, interesting. I’m interested in the “normal” because I think it is a necessary context for any claims or analysis about that which is exceptional. For example, it’s not appropriate to read too much into the fact that Radcliffe published Athlin &amp; Dunbayne unsigned, since this was “normal” — a default position, rather than an informative expression of intentionality. So, one kind of “normal” that interests me is this idea of the default: what might we expect? The default normal can be defined at multiple levels of granularity. We are handed a two-volume work, what might we expect from it at default? We are looking at a poem written by a man in 1792, what might we expect from it at default? Making these naive default guesses will be tied to another meaning of “normal,” that of “most prevalent.” From this perspective “normal” serves more as a synonym of “common.” What do we find the most of? Again, this can be defined at multiple levels of granularity. (Is most-ness a trait of normality, or of exceptionality….?) Can we better characterize the background against which outlier works were written and read?
What is a "normal" footprint in the print culture of this decade? (i.e., what are the boundaries a work has to surpass to be unusually popular or unusually unpopular?)
In both cases, it is difficult to describe “normal for an eighteenth century audience” through the mediating lenses of our databases. One key question, in fact, is “is there anything that seems normal in these databases which would not seem normal to the eighteenth century public?” I anticipate denaturalizing some aspects of these databases, e.g., the way that the flatten distinctions between different buying publics (social classes, time periods, tastes).
I’m also interested in “disreputable” literatures, which have often been some versions of popular or some versions of normal — this is an essentially ethical attachment, or perhaps an inherent contrariness; any time a work is dismissed for any reason, I wish to question the importance of the evaluation metrics which rejected it, and seek whatever may be of value in the rejected work. This is one way a reparative impulse underlies the project: so what is these things were common, or cheap, or bad — that doesn’t mean they have to be worthless. The arbitrariness of the literary canon is that essentially any artistic product can be imbued with value by its audience. (Guillory has a lot on this.) I want to explore how we can value that which has not been valued.</Text>

            <Text>The 1790s in Digital Archives: A Meta-Analysis of Holdings
A major concern regarding digital humanities research is the ability of findings to be “representative.” There is broad understanding that digital archives contain gaps, but little specific knowledge of the nature of those gaps. My project is analogous to a scientific meta-analysis, comparing several major digital collections. I consider all works published in Britain between 1789 and 1799 across six digital archives. The collections examined are heterogeneous, ranging from 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue to 466 XML files created by the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership. I use a range of approaches, including topic modelling, to identify what kinds of literature each corpus emphasizes, and what omissions and errors scholars must be aware of. By comparing the holdings and metadata of these collections, this paper lays groundwork for future scholars to work with digital corpora in a nuanced, selective way.

TO WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ.
DEAR SIR,

THERE is, I hope, some propriety in my addressing a Com|position
to you, which would never perhaps have existed, had
I not, amid the heavy pressure of many sorrows, derived
infinite consolation from your Poetry, and some degree of
animation and of confidence from your esteem.

The following performance is far from aspiring to be con|sidered
as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, "THE
TASK;" I am perfectly sensible, that it belongs not to a
feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Ulysses.

The force, clearness, and sublimity of your admirable Poem;
the felicity, almost peculiar to your genius, of giving to the
most familiar objects dignity and effect, I could never hope to (ECCO-TCP)

Figure &lt;$n#fig:juxta-emigrants-p1&gt; shows how Juxta highlights the words which vary between these three copies.
Both of the OCR copies contain errors in individual letters which render the whole word interpretable by a human but not by text mining software, as in the case of “beavy” for “heavy.” The ECCO copy struggles with the fact that ſ is not an available character, sometimes substituting an f, as in “prefure” for “preſſure.” Both leave out spaces between words, creating new tokens like “isfarfrom” and “andſublimity,” though HathiTrust is less prone to this error.
Other features of the OCR copies are accurate to the page image but would nonetheless interfere with text mining. The hyphenation of “Com- poſition,” for example, would prevent it from rendering as a single word, though here even the careful TCP copy would introduce the same problem, since the line break is encoded as “Com|position.” Before the TCP copy could be used for text mining, the | characters would likely need to be removed — not too different from removing the hyphenation from the ECCO and Hathi copies. Most difficult to resolve is the fact that OCR naturally attempts to capture all text on the page, including the signature mark and catch word. In ECCO these appear as “,a reach” and in Hathi they are “3. - Reach” whereas TCP more appropriately leaves these out. Unlike the problems with hyphenated words, there is no way to correct for the inclusion of catchwords in a document, since there is no predictable way to identify them — but keeping them in the document will cause any text-mining software to count these words twice.
The usual “text cleaning” procedures would further prepare these OCR texts for text mining by transforming all words to lowercase, removing all punctuation, and, in most cases, deleting all words which don’t match a predefined dictionary of valid words. A scholar working with the HathiTrust OCR would almost certainly add to this a step converting the ſ character to an s, as discussed above, in order to make the dictionary comparison feasible. The result of this ‘cleaning’ would likely look something like the following:

to william dear sir there is i hope some propriety in my a potion to you which would never perhaps have existed had i not amid the heavy of many sorrows derived infinite consolation from your poetry and some degree of animation and of your he following performance aspiring to be con as an imitation of your inimitable poem the task i am sensible that it belongs not to a feeble hand to draw the bow of clearness and sublimity admirable poem the felicity almost peculiar to your genius of the familiar dignity and i could never hope to a reach (ECCO, as it would likely appear after text “cleaning”)

Strikingly, these ‘clean’ texts are now further from legible to human eyes, as OCR errors which a reader could mentally correct (such as “beavy” for “heavy” are now entirely removed.</Text>

            <Text>Philosophical scepticism, the questioning of the adequacy of evidence to justify any view or belief, and the questioning of the criteria for decid- ing intellectual issues in any domain whatsoever, reached its high point in modern philosophy during the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the century the complete edition of Pierre Bayle’s Dictionnaire historique et critique (1702) appeared, raising sceptical problems about matters in philosophy, the- ology, science, and history, and providing what Voltaire called ‘the arsenal of the Enlightenment’. Bishop Pierre Daniel Huet’s Traite ́ philosophique de la faiblesse de l’esprit humain (Treatise on the Weakness of the Human Mind), a forceful presentation of Pyrrhonism, written at the end of the seventeenth century but published posthumously in 1723, became a sensation (Popkin 1993, p. 139). The Traite ́ appeared twice in English, and in Italian, Latin, and German in short order. In 1718 the most scholarly edition of the writ- ing of Sextus Empiricus was published by J. A. Fabricius, with the Greek text and Latin translations. This was soon followed by two printings of a French translation of Sextus’s Hypotyposes (Outlines of Pyrrhonism), and David Hume carried the sceptical analysis of human reasoning to its highest point in his Treatise of Human Nature (1739–40). A mitigated form of scepti- cism was developed by many French Enlightenment thinkers, culminating in the radical scepticism of Jean-Pierre Brissot and Condorcet in the last quarter of the century.

            <Text>“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)
“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)
“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and that there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels."

“At the Minerva Press, William Lane, who had printed 11 items in the 1770s and 131 in the 1780s, produced 402 in the 1790s.” (48)

“works may be classified in more than one category. Thus, a work may appear in two categories within a table (as in both epistolary and sentimental) or be listed in both tables (as in translation and courtship).” (56)

￼(57)

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

            <Text>My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. The “major” works across the period develop from sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. I want to pose the same questions as the authors themselves: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor one’s feelings without being misled by them? In pursuit of this answer, my reading has led me to a subject matter, a methodology, and an affective stance.
I remain committed, for my subject matter, to the 1790s as an incredibly dense period of complex literary production shaped by what Robert Miles identifies as an apocalyptic political rupture.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change. For example, there is a narrative about a naive emotional philosophy in sentimental novels (benevolence), which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature. Perhaps, at its broadest level, this narrative is true or useful, but there are many more ways in which it is false.
One way which I seek to be more accurate is by paying close attention to what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. So, for example, I am interested in Burke’s Reflections as a text which is outcompeted by Williams when it is first published, and attracts a flood of negative responses, but which slowly outcompetes the others and becomes more successful over time as it gains credit for its prescience.
As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one.
My interest in the gothic is thus subsumed within my interest in 18thC strategies of feeling generally; gothic fear and supernatural imagination both represent strategies which are in conversation (and competition) with other strategies, which I also want to integrate.

            <Text>“After publishing her first major volume of poems in 1791, Mary Robinson made her sensational debut as a novelist in 1792 with Vancenza; Or, the Dangers of Credulity. Reputedly selling out before noon on the first day of publication, the two-volume novel set in fifteenth-century Spain reads, in some places, much like a Radcliffian re-telling of Robinson’s scandal- ous love affair with the Prince of Wales in 1780. … If Vancenza exemplifies Robinson’s tendency to revise the story of her life and turn it into novelistic capital, however, the cautionary tale also evinces her desire to claim moral authority in a public sphere where she had earlier won somewhat dubious celebrity as an actress, a royal mistress, and a flamboyant woman of fashion. By the end of Van- cenza, Robinson’s didactic voice is almost indistinguishable from that of her fictional Marchioness de Vallorie, a ‘gracefully majestic’ figure who not only warns against ‘the dangers and calamities to which [unprotected women] are exposed’ but also recommends ‘the laudable pursuits of mental culti- vation’ over ‘the tinsel blandishments of fashionable folly’.3 More impor- tantly perhaps, the Marchioness echoes the radical discourse of the 1790s as she decries the ‘empty distinctions’ of rank and wealth. Characterized as an ‘affectionate monitress’ and an ‘excellent preceptress’, the Marchio- ness figures Robinson’s reinvention of herself as a moralist, one who would ultimately claim affiliation with the radical school of Mary Wollstonecraft rather than with the conservative camp of Hannah More.” (Setzer 56)

“After Vancenza, Robinson made more controversial bids for moral author- ity as she wove explicit critiques of contemporary social and political injustices into the sentimental fabric of six subsequent novels set in the turbulent 1790s: The Widow (1794), Angelina (1796), Hubert de Sevrac (1796), Walsingham (1797), The False Friend (1799), and The Natural Daughter (1799). Accord- ing to conservative commentators in the late 1790s, Robinson’s fame as a poet was seriously compromised by her association with Joseph Johnson’s circle of radical authors, which included Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, and William Godwin. In his satiric poem The Pursuits of Literature, Thomas / 
James Mathias associated Robinson with Charlotte Smith, Elizabeth Inchbald, and other nameless women writers who were so ‘frequently whin- ing and frisking in novels’ that ‘girls’ heads turn wild with impossible adven- tures, and now and then are tainted with democracy’.5 Taking inspiration from Mathias, the Reverend Richard Polwhele included Robinson in a despi- cable Jacobin band of ‘unsex’d females’ led by Wollstonecraft.6 
Although recent scholarship has called attention to the emergence of a radical feminist voice in Robinson’s fiction, her epistolary novel Angelina typically receives no more than a passing nod.7 One noteworthy exception is Adriana Craciun’s overview of Robinson’s radical politics, which includes a consideration of Angelina as a ‘feminist meditation on arbitrary power, one in dialogue with Godwin and written by a close friend who addressed him as “my dear Philosopher”’.8 While this characterization of Angelina usefully foregrounds the radical sentiments expressed in the novel, it distorts the chronology of Robinson’s friendship with Godwin. Citing evidence in Godwin’s diary, biographers concur that he did not meet Robinson until 9 February 1796, more than a month after the publication of Angelina.9 A more substantive issue, however, is the complete effacement of Wollstone- craft’s influence in the textual genesis of Angelina. Although I do not dispute Craciun’s claim that it enters into ‘dialogue’ with Godwin’s Caleb Williams (1794), I aim to show how Angelina is also a fictional mobilization of radical precepts articulated in Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). As I read the novel, it is ultimately not so much a ‘meditation on arbitrary power’ as it is a polemical intervention in the 1790s war of ideas.” (56-7)</Text>

            <Text>Critical algorithm studies is therefore a crucial background for my work — but “critical” is literally in the name of of the field, and I still seek to be post-critical and reparative. As I encounter the limitations of the various information and tools through which I attempt to understand the 1790s, my goal is to do something other than facilely observe that they are limited. Instead, I want to identify the best ways to continue building on their foundations. In a digital humanities context, a focus on building connections can be mundanely practical: typing indexes from print works into spreadsheets, correcting errors within datasets, writing programs to process metadata: all of these maintain the functional usability of existing resources in new contexts. When this kind of extended, detail-oriented labour is combined with serious reflection on the histories and possible futures of these resources, I contend, they bring us to new knowledge. In this, maintaining and using digital resources is also a way to repair them — and to produce reparative readings of their contents.</Text>

            <Text>“Chapter  begins to explain how questions of form and genre intersect with grittier aspects of literary production and dis-tribution. is requires enriching a library of texts with social context— so we know, for instance, which works became com-mercial successes or critical favorites. Armed with that evidence, scholars can ask how literary trends were related to the pressures exerted by the marketplace or by changing patterns of critical judgment. is inquiry reveals a strikingly regular pattern, where the criteria dening literary prominence align strongly with di-rections of change across long periods of time. e arc of literary history is long, but it bends (so to speak) toward prestige. At this point, we are no longer simply transforming familiar accounts of history by backing up to take a longer view of them. If stan-dards of aesthetic judgment have remained relatively stable for centuries at a time, and have shaped literary change over equally long timelines, then we are looking at an account of literary his-tory that is basically at odds with the story of rapid generational reversal told in our textbooks and anthologies.” (xvi)

“How do the standards of literary distinction change? How rapidly? And how are the directions of literary change related to the social pressures exerted by reviewers or purchasers?” (69)

“When I say that critics have contented themselves with speculation on these questions, I don’t mean that we have been timid. Our speculations are often quite bold. … But we don’t expect flourishes of that kind to create much consensus. … So when historians are trying to produce consensus about cultural change, we tend to shift into a more cautious narrative mode emphasizing individual events: the construction of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel or the publication of Lyrical Ballads. Then we hope that readers will accept these events as emblems of a larger concept whose outlines we cannot sketch precisely.
The thesis of this chapter is that a different kind of description is possible, which will combine the rigor of a detailed account with the ambitious scope of a larger narrative. ” (69)

“Our received narrative of this period is organized by a succession of discrete concepts dening dierent criteria of judg-ment: Romanticism, Victorian realism, aestheticism, naturalism, and modernism. For many observers, this has implied a fairly profound transformation of literary opinion every generation or so. Modernism, for instance, was a “literary revolution” that changed not only how writers created new works but how they evaluated the past, producing “a radical and wholesale revision of the inherited conception of English literature.” In fact, when we model the textual dimension of literary suc-cess, we find standards of judgment that change only gradually and slowly. A model trained on mid- nineteenth- century evidence can do a decent job of predicting which books will be prominent in the 1920s or 1930s. When standards do change, they can move in a consistent direction for a century at a time. This is not to say that shorter- lived concepts like “modernism” or “naturalism” are unimportant. But it is not safe to assume that long- term change is produced simply by stringing together the smaller generational confiicts that we spend so much time discussing. Instead, long arcs of change seem to be driven in significant measure by shared assumptions that rarely became overt subjects of debate.” (70)

Orginally he looked for the thing I am kind of looking for in the 1790s: “We hoped to trace the emergence of Andreas Huyssen’s “great divide”— a widening gulf between mass culture and elite literary taste, which Huyssen describes as an emergent subject of concern in “the last decades of the 19th century and the first few years of the 20th.” (71) They looked at 20 year slices from 1840 to 1920, expecting the disjunctions to be easy to spot.

“Broadly, our results conrm a version of this story of-ten advanced by scholars of the Victorian era, which has por-trayed this process less as a cultural division than as a gradual expansion of the reading audience, leading to a slow diversica-tion of the market across three- decker novels, penny dreadfuls, yellowbacks, pulp magazines, and so on. is may be slightly dierent from the darker and more dichotomous story of a great divide advanced by modernists and scholars of modernism, but it is not a radically new picture. The more provocative parts of this chapter, I think, are things found by accident along the way. It is not just social stratication that changes slowly: the criteria of literary judgment themselves seem to be remarkably stable. When they do change, they move with the momentum of an ocean liner: an observer in the year 1900, equipped with a computer, could have predicted a signi-cant component of change for the next fifty years just by extrapolating the directions of change visible in the last fifty. Literature seems to move in the direction of prestigious examples, and it can keep moving in roughly the same direction across a long timeline.” (72)

Both authors and scholars have incentives to exaggerate the strength of individual ‘revolutions’ — and mentally may find it necessary since it’s hard to hold large timescales of reception in our heads. However, “Changes we have characterized as sudden revolutions may come to look more like eddies on the surface of a stream that was flowing all the time in a consistent direction.” (73)

“failure to satisfy everyone is exactly what we should expect from a measure of prestige, since prestige is a contested perspectival category.” (73) Eventually we should try lots of them.

“Scholars more commonly study reception by contrasting posi-tive and negative reviews— an approach that makes sense if one / is interested in gradations of approval but that leaves out many works never reviewed at all in selective venues. This blind spot matters: literary historians cannot understand the boundaries of literary distinction if we only look at works on one side of the boundary.” (Underwood 73-4)

Honest methods: “I created an initial list of titles by quizzing friends who are scholars of this period.” (74)

“We also needed a sample that would contain books reviewed less often. To conrm that a given book was never reviewed in any of these publications would have been a tedious task. It was easier simply to select works at random from a very large collec-/-tion, while excluding authors already in the reviewed sample. In practice, this turns up mostly books that were rarely reviewed. But because sampling was genuinely random, there will be a few well- known authors in the random sample. e model often recognizes these people and predicts that they will be successful— which sadly has to be counted against it as an “error.” ” (74-5)

“A digital library is itself a sample, with particular selection biases, to be discussed below.” (75) “But it samples a social range much broader than the range cov-ered by elite periodicals, and what I needed in this study was not completeness but contrast.” (76)

Models of reception in Poetry and Fiction

“Each volume was represented for the most part as a bag of words— simply counting the number of times each word occurred in the text. Before settling on this representation, I tried many other features (including rhyme and meter for poetry and “conditional entropy” for fiction). But clever additions of that kind didn’t improve the models significantly, and tiny increases in predictive accuracy are rarely worth large increases in complexity. Better methods of predicting literary success will no doubt eventually emerge.” (76)

Subtle burn: “But the authors don’t specify how much difference those factors made or share code and data, so at this point it is impossible to draw firm conclusions from their argument.” (77)

“Technically, this upward drift is an error in the model. Volumes are not really more likely to be re-viewed just because they were published later: the reviewed and random volumes have the same distribution across the timeline. But this is an error of an interesting sort. A model trying to predict success for the whole century fails to produce perfectly evenhanded criteria, because books published later tend to have more of the verbal signals associated with success (across the whole century). is upward drift suggests that historical change across the timeline moved in the direction of the standards that governed reception at any given point on the timeline.” (78)
I don’t understand this.
“ In all these mod-els, the mean probability that a volume will be reviewed appears to increase across time. at is not literally true. Reviewed and random volumes are evenly distributed across the timeline, so the probability of review remains constant. But the words com-mon in reviewed volumes (across the whole timeline) also tend to become more common in all volumes as we approach the end of the timeline, so the cloud of data points always tilts up. e “bar” that volumes have to clear in order to be reviewed, in other words, seems to slide upward.” (91)

“I want to reect for a moment on the signicance of the fact that this model works at all. It isn’t self- evident that we should be able to guess whether a book of poems will be reviewed purely by looking at the text. … this is not a situation where we know that there is a pattern in a group of texts and set out to test an algorithm’s ability to capture the pattern. Rather, we are testing whether the social phenomenon of poetic prominence has any textual correlate at all. The answer could have been no.” (78)
This is an effective rhetorical move

“Trained readers were right 68% of the time.” (79)
This is an INCREDIBLY helpful and persuasive experiment

The Secrets of Literary Distinction
“The interpretive problem we confront here lies not in machine learning but in the actual complexity of literary reception— which is not required to map onto a single thesis that can be crisply explained in five pages.
Because the models produced by machine learning are complex, they can faithfully and rigorously measure the actual strength of the boundary between two groups of texts. But because these models are nearly as complex as the actual social boundaries at issue, they also leave a lot of explanatory work to the interpreter.” (81)

“I have found that the clearest and liveliest way to explicate a model is to read a few passages over its shoulder.” (82)
This is also very rhetorically effective — looking at passages and bolding/italicising the particular words the algorithm is responding to.
None of this is relevant to my own work, though I do enjoy it
“the obscure poets in our random sample lean toward abstraction and positive sentiment, whereas reviewed poets emphasize physical description— especially of colors, nature, and the human body. … All of this boils down to a fairly clear contrast between embodied lyric subjectivity and an older mode of poetic authority that is more didactic, sentimental, and collective. We may imag-ine that the struggle between these modes was resolved once and for all in Romanticism, but in reality the older mode persisted, and elite poetic culture continued to be dened by an ever ercer rejection of it, all the way through the early twentieth century.” (84)

“Models trained on a quarter century of ction are right (on average) about 71% of the volumes in the whole century; they lose only 1.5% accuracy compared to a model trained on everything. Models trained on a quarter century of poetry are right about 75.9% of the volumes in the poetry data set— a bigger loss (of 4%), since models of poetic prestige were more accurate to begin with. But accuracy is still durable enough to suggest that the standards that persist for twenty- five years will remain largely the same for the rest of the century. This gives us a rough and ready answer to the question posed in this section: How quickly does reception change? At the boundary we model here (getting reviewed in selective periodicals), the standards we can model at all seem to have changed rather slowly.” (90)

“if opinions about poetry are really more volatile than opinions about fiction, that’s something literary historians should know.” (91%)

“In short, I am not proposing a monocausal explanation for literary change. Literature moves in a direction shaped by many factors at once. What we see in any individual model is a projec-tion of the actual, multidimensional vector of change onto a sim-pler, one- dimensional axis of measurement; it is, so to speak, one component of the vector.” (92)
“We might speculate, for instance, that standards tend to drift upward because critics and authors respond directly to pressure from reviewers or because they imitate, and slightly exaggerate, the standards already implicit in prominent examples. In that case, synchronic standards would produce diachronic change. But causality could also work the other way: a long- term pattern of diachronic change could itself create synchronic standards, if readers in each decade along the way formed their criteria of literary distinction partly by contrasting the latest thing to the embarrassing past. In fact, causal arrows could run in both of these directions” (93)
“It is interesting, for instance, that predicted probabilities of review correlate with au-thors’ dates of birth more strongly than they correlate with publi-cation dates. This detail suggests that the causal processes responsible for change are located fairly early in an author’s life, and it may hint that authors imitate prestigious examples.” (93)
“Nor do we actually need a causal explanation of this phenomenon to see that it could have far- reaching consequences for literary history. The model I have presented already suggests that some things scholars tend to describe as rejections of tradition— modernist insistence on the concrete image, for instance— are better explained as continuations of a long- term trend, guided by established standards.”

Ah: I’m not sure it’s fair to say that literature changes at all. New works of literature comes into being: they are presumably related to previous works of literature. No singular thing called Literature exists.

“even when a model knows only about the language of the work, it is possible that predictions about reception could seem accurate only because they were tacitly based on the depressingly reliable assumption that works by Americans, or women, wouldn’t get reviewed.Problems of this kind are becoming important in twenty- rst- century life, where they are often diagnosed as “algorithmic bias.” … In historical inquiry, the same problem emerges, but bias may not be exactly the right word to apply in this context. At any rate, historians are interested in the intersection of social preferences; it is not an aspect of the past that we simply factor out. It is quite possible, for instance, that Britishness really was a signicant component of literary prestige in nineteenth- century America. A model of literary culture that covered its eyes to avoid seeing that preference wouldn’t represent the period. On the other hand, historians do want to know when one so-cial category denes another. For instance, if a model of prestige turned out to be mostly reducible to Britishness, plus masculin-ity, that’s something we would want to acknowledge. So without forcing our sample of the past to be unrealistically balanced, we would like to have some way to measure the effects of imbalances. Fortunately, quantitative methods make it easy to look at the same evidence from several dierent angles and measure the interactions between social categories.” (94)

“In our data set, women are underrepresented, contributing only 38% of the volumes in ction and 25% in poetry. Just as importantly, they are distributed a little unequally across the re- / viewed and random samples— slightly more likely than men to be reviewed in poetry and signicantly less so in ction. is imbalance raises the possibility that our models of “prestige” might be leaning on gender as a clue.” (94-5)
Tests by seeing if gender-balanced samples are less accurate — only slightly less accurate
“is is not to deny that women writers confronted barriers and were judged unequally; their sheer underrepresentation in the data set, by itself, is an eloquent fact. But the criteria of prestige that we can model using textual evidence don’t seem mostly reducible to gender.” (95)
“the prestige of British poetry is the only case I can nd where authorial demo-graphics clearly distort our model of prestige. Rather than being a mere sampling error, I suspect this represents a real association between nationality and poetic capital. But more research would be needed to say for sure” (96)

Separating the Axes of Popularity and Prestige
“It seemed reasonable to hypothesize that serious literary writing would de-velop its own idiom, diverging from the quicker patter of (say) detective and adventure ction. If so, models of prestige should get more accurate over time, as it became easier to distinguish high literary culture from the rest of the literary eld” (96)
“e pattern I actually found was subtler and more complex. … Instead of imagining that literature became more strongly sorted along a single axis (separating elite literary taste from mass culture) we should imagine two largely parallel axes of distinction that slowly unfold to become perpendicular.” (96)

“within the random sample, I discovered an even deeper divide between works that were left out of serious reviewing because they seemed too sensational or popular and works left out because they were merely obscure.” (97)
“I may not have fully appreciated this dierence at the beginning of the experiment. But one learns a lot, informally, while sampling hundreds of books from the depths of a library” (97)

Looked at sales — to replicate Bourdieu’s approach of separating economic and cultural capital. Similar to Stanford Literary Lab, but with different metrics — Stanford used academic citations for cultural capital, and copies in libraries for economic capital. (98)
Underwood uses bestseller lists for popularity, partly interpreted with empirical Bayes. (99)

“Literary prestige and market success did not become incompatible, but they did lose their tight correlation.” (101) Even this I think may really be a shift in our assumption that prestige is reflected in reviewing??
“e real change is better described as diversication. Where the mid- nineteenth- century map could almost reduce into a single axis (prominence versus obscurity), the mid- twentieth- century map really has to be characterized using two separate dimen-sions.” (103)

“Distant readers are sometimes accused of laboriously proving things that other critics already suspected. I have resisted that argument ercely when I think it is hindsight bias. But in this section of the book, I would acknowledge it is largely true. Many / observers— all the way back to George Gissing— have implied that commercial success and literary judgment somehow parted company in the second half of the nineteenth century or the rst half of the twentieth. I set out to conrm that hypothesis not because I really had much doubt about it but because I wanted to see whether a phenomenon like that could be traced with quan-titative models.And even when a model basically conrms a well- established hunch, we are likely to learn something along the way. In this case, the division I had expected to nd turned out to be sub-tler and more complex than I began by assuming. Instead of Huyssen’s emerging “gap between high art and mass culture,” I found something more like a slight unfolding of previously parallel axes. I can also say with considerable condence now that the change was gradual. e evidence uncovered here might even allow a skeptic to raise questions about the theory I initially borrowed from Pierre Bourdieu. His assumption that economic and cultural capital can be treated as separate axes of distinc-tion is clearly well suited to twentieth- century culture. But there could be some risk of anachronism in projecting it back onto a nineteenth- century cultural eld where those aspects of promi-nence were less independent.” (103-4)

The Narrative Challenge of Long Timelines
“Literary judgment is never easy to predict; the models described in this chapter range from only 72.5% to 83% accurate. But the part of reception that can be predicted at all is predicted by models that change relatively little from the 1850s through the 1940s. Moreover, a large component of the change that does take place appears to have a clear long- term social rationale. Poetry and ction both move steadily in the direction of prevailing critical standards. Poetry apparently moves twice as fast as ction. ere may be a scholar somewhere who expected to see all this, but I confess that I didn’t. I believed the histories that taught me to interpret the last two hundred years as a series of conicts between roughly generational literary movements, separated by periods of stability.” (105)
“eory guides empirical inquiry, but new empirical results should also eventually reshape theory. So what theoretical infer-ences might we draw from this chapter’s models of literary pres-tige? … On the other hand, when we discover unexpected evidence, we should pause to review our epistemological strategies, because some of them are probably responsible for the blind spot that has just been exposed.”(105)
“ere are still moments of sudden change in the picture: in chapter , for instance, we found that the detective story emerged just as suddenly as histories centered around Edgar Allan Poe have suggested. So numbers can reveal sudden changes, where history contains sudden changes. But numbers also reveal a host of slower changes that our existing histories have failed to describe.” (106)
“The deeper problem is that, for the last sixty or seventy years, we have assumed that literary history can only be interesting and edifying insofar as it is a story about conflict.”(106)

‘Instead, we see the whole literary eld move slowly in the same direction, guided by well- established, broadly shared standards. “Do people like poetic diction that’s concrete and tinged with melancholy?” writers seem to reect. “Very well, I’ll write poetry that is concrete and melancholy— but even more so!” The historical power of “even more so” needs broader recognition than literary critics have given it. When we are reasoning cynically about genre ction and movie pitches, we recognize the iron grip of this principle. “Even more so” explains how a single gritty reboot that makes money can doom us to a long sequence of ever- grittier reboots. But for some reason, historians of high literary forms have ignored that kind of momentum, preferring to suggest instead that change is driven by overt aesthetic debate or covert ideological conict.”(107)
“Sometimes the forward motion of a train has nothing to do with the people having a fistfight on top of it.” (108)

“In par-ticular, we need better ways to narrate slow change. Scholars are already aware that many aspects of literary judgment change slowly. In choosing exemplary works for syllabi, we tacitly acknowledge an axis of distinction that can outlast ephemeral movements and periods. But we keep this quality of exemplarity separate from the normative standards that organized a book’s reception by its contemporaries. At any rate, we are not good at explaining how they intersect. Scholars whose research is char-acterized by a ercely local historical relativism will switch gears suddenly when discussing syllabi in order to say that a book they have chosen is just better written in some timeless sense than an alternate example of the same movement. e Paterian no-tion that we are choosing an example “which expresses most ad-equately this or that special manifestation” of beauty has always made a thin cover story for the contradiction.” (108)
“Instead of treating exemplarity as a principle separate from history, we need to develop a larger scale of historicism, able to acknowledge that our own aesthetic preferences are directly pro-duced by and still implicated in the changes under discussion.” (108)
“In short, this chapter claims to expose a problem in our current approach to literary history. If I am right, an important component of change spreads out across a longer arc than our theories and narrative strategies have been able to reveal. But I don’t claim to have resolved the problem, either intellectually or as a matter of narrative craft.” (109)
“Whole books could be written to explore that topic. Those books will have to be written and reviewed and critiqued before we can say that we fully understand the transformation of literature across a long timeline. After that foundation has been laid, we may be able to write more satisfying historical narratives.” (109)
“I can imagine a more exible mode of narration that would trace dierent wavelengths of change using models of dierent sizes. A literary historian might close- read passages not just to illustrate the models but to explain transitions between them. … But narratives of that kind may have to emerge from a process almost as slow and collective as literary history itself. e intro-ductions to our anthologies didn’t acquire their casual condence overnight; they are condensed summaries that build on two cen-turies of bibliography and debate. New quantitative methods will initially disrupt that condence, reopen debate, and create aesthetic problems for literary historians. We may have to spend another decade or two checking our assumptions and getting our facts right before we are ready to put things back together again in a composed and elegant way.” (110)

            <Text>“16 In his discussion of JSTOR's "intolerably corrupt" OCR text, Nicholson Baker suggests that the reason why the user is prevented from scrolling through this naked OCR output is that scholars "might, after a few days, be dis- turbed by the frequency and strangeness of its mistakes . . . and they might no longer be willing to put their trust in the scholarly integrity of the database."17 Baker's criticism of JSTOR, however, is based on an error rate (with editorial intervention) of just one typo in every two thousand characters.” (Spedding 439)
“The two OCR-captured texts average over 150 typos per 2,000 characters,22 a high enough error rate to render parts of the text completely unintelligible. It is not clear how typical this error rate is, and how much it declines with editorial intervention,23 but again the scale of the problem is clear.24 Consequently, the claim that OCR errors "may occasionally result in incorrect character capture, which may affect some [ECCO] full-text search results," seems wildly, even heroically, optimistic.” (Spedding 440)</Text>

            <Text>Second experiment: identify genre make-up of databases. (Develop something using topic modelling of titles.) 
“A Romance By Any Other Name: Topic Modelling for an Ontology of 1790s Genres.” Keystone DH. Philadelphia, PA, July 8-10.

When working with large literary databases, scholars naturally wish to know what kind of literature they are working with. A high incidence of religious language in an eighteenth century corpus, for example, will mean something different depending on how many of the documents included in the corpus are sermons. However, the larger and more heterogenous the database, the less likely it is that all of its contents have been thoroughly and consistently identified. Eighteenth century texts predate systems such as the Library of Congress subject headings, so many of the holdings in widely-used resources such as the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) include no metadata regarding their contents’ subject matter. This paper demonstrates the results of a method to assign subject matter designations to all works within these corpora, taking advantage of one of the unique features of eighteenth century literature: long and descriptive titles. Eighteenth century books were advertised and sold without any visual cues as to their contents; they attracted readers through the strength of their title pages alone. Their lengthy titles therefore intentionally communicate their genres, and, as my paper demonstrates, their messages can be distilled through topic modelling. I present my results for the 52,000 titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799, and discuss the resulting ontology of generic categories. As I demonstrate, inferring genres based on how texts describe themselves produces a very different picture of the categories of textual production than the post-facto descriptions that later generations of scholars have produced. I am then able to use these subject categories to compare the contents of several commonly-used digital resources, to identify how representative of eighteenth century literature as a whole each database is. Finally, I discuss how my methods might be adapted to address similar gaps in metadata in related fields.

            <Text>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.</Text>

            <Text>When we study literature through text mining, our conclusions are not based on an examination of “literature” itself, but on the corpus which is a sample or model of the imagined whole of “literature.” Despite the importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of text mining research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of corpora which re-create social inequalities.
As an eighteenth century scholar, I examine five corpora which are used as the basis of most eighteenth century distant reading: the English Short Title Catalogue database; Eighteenth Century Collections Online; the Eighteenth Century Collections Online  Text Creation Partnership; Project Gutenberg; and HathiTrust. I manually evaluate each corpus’s holdings for a narrow sample of texts, works published in England 1789-99, to investigate and contextualize their representation of female authors. For this eleven-year period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? 
In addition to calculating the gender ratio of authorship for each of the five corpora (including an assessment of the unsigned or unattributable works), I correlate gender with the basic categories of writing present in the corpus, to form more specific conclusions about the role of gender in corpus-building. Simple topic-modelling of the titles of eighteenth century works allows me to identify broad categories such as plays, poetry, pamphlets, novels, songs, sermons, ephemera, and so on. Titles in the eighteenth century are long, and served as advertisements, intentionally created to actively communicate this level of information about their works’ contents: although topic modelling of titles would not be sufficient in other centuries, it is remarkably effective here. Identifying the representation within each corpus of these categories of writing reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry in the smaller corpora.
This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller corpora. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of exclusion. Asking bibliographical questions of multiple corpora, in order to learn about the corpora themselves, emphasizes an under-examined stage of text mining research, and provides a basis for other scholars to use these corpora more precisely. Asking pointed questions about gender, in particular, may allow future users of these corpora to address some impacts of historical sexism.</Text>

            <Text>To navigate the 1790s, I turn to an author whose career and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature: Charlotte Smith. Smith was highly productive in multiple genres throughout the 1790s, and had a complex and contested literary legacy after the 1790s. As literary scholars re-assess ideas about literary seriousness, popularity, and women’s writing, our assessment of Smith has shifted as well. By examining their bibliographies with computational methods, I again ask how she might continue to look different if we look at her a different way. I particularly examine the extent to which digital resources have kept up with the re-evaluation of Smith as a central figure in British Romanticism.

            <Text>Bainbridge is not alone is taking Walter Scott as a kind of pinnacle, and looking backwards in search of his antecedents. Richard Cronin, in The Politics of Romantic Poetry, concerns himself with “poetry that speaks to a divided society in an attempt to constitute its readers as citizens of […] ‘the pure commonwealth’” (13). This definition of “political poetry” leads him to Erasmus Darwin as the poet of the the Revolution and the Revolutionary war, William Blake as the poet of the Napoleonic wars, and Richard Southey and Walter Savage Landor as the poets of the post-war period — ending, irresistibly, as so many do, with Walter Scott. His discussion of Scott praises him for [successfully playing the capital-transformation game]: “Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means” (94). The Romantic poets, in both Bainbridge and Cronin’s accounts, support their claims to insight and importance through the inaccessibility of their work in print.</Text>

Broken records
“A broken record occurs when information added to a record has not been checked against the copies already listed under that record” (Karian 285)

Inaccurate dates
‘The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records—for example, everything from 1720—there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720” (Karian 291)

“only records bibliographic information about surviving books … After a careful study of book advertisements, inventories and bibliographies, it seems to this investigator that, excluding jobbing and newspaper printing, as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701–1800 has not been incorporated into the ESTC. In other words, for up to 10 per cent of the editions printed in the eighteenth century, not a single copy is known to survive.” (Suarez 40)</Text>

            <Text>

As early as 2003, the TCP executive board meeting minutes reported that “Michigan has made agreements with Gale and Readex to support conversion of subsets of the Eighteenth Century and Evans Early American materials which will allow us to create a cross-searchable corpus of important historical texts … The University of Michigan has reached agreements to create a subset of accurately keyed and encoded texts in conjunction with these projects, and aims to produce 6,000 early American and 10,000 18th century texts. In the near term, this will not affect production of EEBO texts because there is adequate capacity to expand beyond existing levels of production. In the long term, this will produce a large number of culturally significant texts, produced to a single standard, that are owned by the library community and complement the EEBO texts for these early historical periods.” (“Meeting Minutes 2003-10-22.”).
In 2004, “Jeff Moyer then updated the Board on its progress with the ECCO product which contains over 26 million pages and 155,000 volumes. To date, they have 60 customers including 6 Canadian and 11 international institutions. They have also done OCR for the ECCO product and are interested in how the TCP text will work and integrate with their OCR.” (“Meeting Minutes 2004-10-21.”).
“In 2005 the project expanded to include Gale-Cengage’s Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (as well as Evans Early American Imprints by Newsbank). However, while the EEBO-TCP project flourishes (with around 40,000 texts transcribed so far), the work on ECCO-TCP stagnated at around 2,000 texts. As well as the main partner institutions of Michigan and Oxford that oess to the eighteenth-century TCP texts, so I’ve listed them below, with a few comments.” (Gregg n. pag.)
“In 2005, the TCP executive board and staff sought to expand the TCP model to other databases of historical books, namely, Gale Cengage’s Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO) and Newsbank Readex’s Evans Early American Imprints (Evans-TCP). These projects never received quite the support attracted by EEBO-TCP, and in the end produced only about 8,000 texts, compared to the 60,000 produced by the latter, with another few thousand on the way.” (TCP “About”)
By October 2005, “the ECCO-TCP project has commenced with the release of a demo, and TCP sponsored an ECCO selection task force in August. … Rich Foley reported that ECCO now covers 120 subscribers and a recent purchase from the JISC. The ECCO product has also sold well in Canada this past year. Rich also reported (relating to a question on Metadata) the release of a My Library product which is opening up access to their metadata at Gale and that he was interested in further doing case studies on how ECCO is used in research and in the classroom.” (“Meeting Minutes 2005-10-20.”)
In 2006, ECCO-TCP was struggling compared to the other TCP products. “Rich Foley reported that ECCO is one of the biggest products at Gale with eighty to ninety ARLs subscribing as well as small institutions. He also said that a focus at Gale was to work on more tools to facilitate undergraduate teaching of their products. … Mark Sandler reported that the TCP budget shows mostly positive balances through 2007. The exception to that is ECCO but because it is still so early in the project, it seems likely that TCP will overcome those problems within the next few months. Nonetheless, the TCP project in EEBO, Evans, and ECCO face potential budget deficits in fiscal year 2008.” At this time, the TCP began to think about the end of the project: “the TCP should set a date to close the partnership (likely around 2010 given current commitments,” partly to address financial solvency. (“Meeting Minutes 2006-09-16”).
In 2007, all three TCP project reported successful sales, though ECCO’s news was the most vague: “Brandon Nordin also reported good news from Gale and along with Mary Sauer-Games announced that the EEBO and ECCO databases will now be cross-searchable so that users can go to either collection and find records from the other” ( “Meeting Minutes 2007-10-30”). Nonetheless, “Evans-TCP and ECCO-TCP sales have historically (for a variety of reasons, chiefly the presence of OCR text in both projects) been weaker than anticipated” ( “Meeting Minutes 2007-10-30”). And the end loomed nigh: “Currently finances are good through fiscal year 2008. EEBO-TCP is on target to complete 25,000 texts by the end of fiscal year 2008. Evans-TCP is likely, given current finances to complete around 6,000 texts. ECCO-TCP will complete around 1,300 texts. Therefore, the TCP, particularly in EEBO-TCP has been a success meeting most of its goals. Nonetheless, Evans-TCP and ECCO-TCP are still short of their goals of 6,000 and 10,000 texts respectively, and in fiscal year 2009, the TCP overall is facing a deficit of around $400,000 if it does not either reduce its current staff or bring in a large influx of money within the next six months” ( “Meeting Minutes 2007-10-30”). These are the last meeting minutes available online.
“EEBO-TCP met its goal of producing 25,000 books in 2009 (thereafter known as “EEBO-TCP Phase 1”), and then undertook work on a second phase to convert the first edition of each remaining unique monographic work in EEBO—another 40,000 or so books, for a total of around 70,000, if all hopes were realized.” (TCP “About”)
“Begun in 2009, Phase II both shrank and expanded the scope of EEBO TCP.  Selection became more discriminating and focused more on English-language (and Welsh- and Gaelic-language) texts to the exclusion of French and Latin titles, and also set aside the serials (periodicals) as a fit project for another time. But within the constraints of English-language monographic titles, it aspired to something approaching comprehensive treatment: EEBO Phase II planned to convert each and every unique work in Early English Books Online (usually the first edition), or an estimated total of around 45,000 books on top of the 25,000 completed in Phase I. This was an ambitious, and always risky, goal. As it happened, enough institutions joined Phase II to fund the completion of about 40,000 titles, of which about 35,000 have been released to date, the remainder slowly working their way through the production pipeline. (TCP “EEBO”)

“As of 2019, the total number of books available in Phase II came to 34,963, with a further release of several thousand additional titles tentatively scheduled for later in the year.  Short of an infusion of new funding, or the adoption of a new production model, this should bring the active work of the TCP to at least an interim conclusion.” (TCP “EEBO”)
“Because of these greater challenges facing ECCO-TCP, it is perhaps better described as a proof of concept than as a completed project. With the support of more than 35 libraries, the TCP keyed, encoded, edited, and released 2,473 ECCO-TCP texts. A further tranche of 628 texts was keyed and encoded but never fully proofed or edited. The texts in this group remain useful for many purposes, however, and bring the total of ECCO-TCP texts to over 3,000. In cooperation with Gale Cengage, these texts have been made freely available to the public.” (TCP, “Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) TCP”)</Text>

            <Title>ch 1 - what's not novels?</Title>
            <Text>Chapter one takes up the eternal problem of archival gaps, and asks how we might interrogate or fill these gaps with computational methods. It asks how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to fascimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disaparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.
Current materials acquired include:
	•	51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue
	•	42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online
	•	10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online
	•	4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library
	•	466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership
Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).
The first chapter thus introduces my decade of interest and the materials and perspectives I bring to bear on it, laying the foundation for my future questions about literary popularity and literary legacy.</Text>

            <Text>“A novel, if at all useful, ought to be a representation of human life and manners, with a view to directing the conduct in the important duties of life, and to correct its follies. But what instruction is to be reaped from the distorted ideas of lunatics, I am at a loss to conceive . . . Are the duties of life so changed, that all the instruction necessary for a young person is to learn to walk at night upon the battlements of an old castle, to creep hands and feet along a narrow passage, and meet the devil at the end of it?” (footnote 23 in Gamer, qtd 55)

“Romances are a dangerous recreation. A few, no doubt, of the best may be friendly to good taste and good morals; but far the greater part are unskilfully written, and tend to corrupt the heart, and stimulate the passions. A habit of reading them breeds a dislike to history, and all the substantial parts of knowledge; withdraws the attention from nature, and truth; and fills the mind with extravagant thoughts, and too often with criminal propensities.” (James Beattie, Dissertations Moral and Critical, 574) (qtd in Gamer 56)

“History and fable have distinct merits, the one to inform us of past events, and the other to inforce wholesome principles by fictitious machinery, and to illustrate them: the latter is indeed often wantonly employed by men of strong imaginations, for no better purpose than to furnish amusement for the leisure of the indolent who read to fill up time. While these species of composition are kept distinct, they answer their respective purposes: but to blend them together, is to poison the sources of information to young readers; who, after feasting on history embellished with these meretricious ornaments, will not easily relish the dry details of truth: such writers, therefore, as they do not address themselves to mature understandings, are not to be considered as candidates for mature praise.” (qtd in Gamer 61)

“[T]he tale is indeed a tale of horror, yet the most painful impression which the work left on our minds was that of great acquirements and splendid genius employed to furnish a mormo for children, a poison for youth, and a provoca- tive for the debauchee. Tales of enchantments and witchcraft can never be useful: our author has contrived to make them pernicious, by blending, with an irreverent negligence, all that is most awfully true in religion with all that is most ridiculously absurd in superstition.94” (qtd Gamer 77)</Text>

“When everything is working right, as it does in ESTC more often than not, the bibliographical description is completely accurate as far as it attempts to go, and variations in the matched copies can be reliably determined by the presence or absence of copy-specific notes. If anything happens to disturb the links between the description and its attached holdings, including errors committed in the course of creating the description, the record gets broken and starts telling lies about physical copies or, worse, about the ideal copy” (Tabor 370)

            <Text>Correlate gender and genre in databases, make some graphs, make some arguments.
“Visualizing the Print Mediascape of the 1790s.” North American Society for the Study of Romanticism. Toronto, ON, August 6-8, 2020.

The 1790s saw unprecedented quantities of print production, spurring debates about how best to identify which works of writing were worthy of further attention. Competing value systems offered different ways to understand what made a work “important” or “popular,” with particular conflict around what made a work “literature.” My research examines the mirror-image of this question, asking what kind of publications were normal. After a series of computational experiments in drawing inferences from bibliographic metadata, I present several ways of visualizing the print output of the 1790s, particularly in terms of gender and genre. 
My research examines the authorship and subject matter (broadly construed) of all titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799 which are included in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) database, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) database, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus, or the HathiTrust database. I calculate the proportion of the titles in each resource that are attributed to men, to women, or are left unsigned. Using the titles of these works and a topic modelling tool which has performed accurately when compared to a manual assessment of random samples, I also roughly identify the subject matter of each title, categorizing works into broad genres such as drama, poetry, Romance, History, or sermons. I am then able to compare these four resources to each other, and to existing scholarly work on the print production of the 1790s. For example, I am able to compare each resource’s holdings to the statistics on the English novel included in Garside, Raven and Schöwerling’s Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction. The core of this paper is a series of data visualizations presenting my experimental results, and drawing on Johanna Drucker’s work on the 
These comparisons illuminate the implicit principles of selection which have shaped the ECCO-TCP and HathiTrust digital collections, but also suggest conclusions about the period itself. I present multiple ways of visualizing the same underlying “data,” (that is, the print production of the 1790s itself) in order to analyze the implications of each way of seeing the decade’s literature. From what viewpoint, for example, can we see the hordes of female Radcliffean imitators which were so decried for dominating the print marketplace? And what other visions are possible?


In the 1790s, in response to unprecedented volumes of print production, British audiences disagreed about how to identify which works of writing were worthy of further attention. Despite sometimes grandiose claims that computational distant reading would make it possible to examine all of literature, without needing to make selections, it is still a matter of important debate to discuss what qualifies a work as “important,” “literary,” or “popular.” In this paper, I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to discuss what constitutes normal within this eleven-year “decade,” and therefore which works and authors might emerge as exceptional.  Particular attention is paid to what contexts reveal, or conceal, the importance of writers as diverse as William Wordsworth, Ann Radcliffe, and Hannah More.</Text>

            <Title>ESTC wordcloud: titles want to tell provenance</Title>
            <Text>What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:
#
By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!
This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.
Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:
	•	A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
	•	The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &amp;c. In three volumes
	•	A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P
There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

            <Text>Chapter three does for Robinson the same initial process that chapter two did for Smith: I assemble, from a range of scholarly resources, an authoritative list of Robinson’s publications, and seek them in each of the six databases. My initial hypothesis is that, due to Robinson’s different posthumous reception, proportionally fewer of her works will be included in smaller archives compared to Charlotte Smith. In addition to comparing Robinson’s inclusion to Smith’s, I will use Robinson to explore the structural makeup of my databases, examining their representation of “authorship” the way I used Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets to examine their representation of “editions.” Robinson frequently wrote under pseudonyms or left works unsigned: how do the databases I examine handle authorship attribution? Discussing the digital encoding of Robinson’s authorship raises the subject of authorship more generally, as a flexible concept which can resist strict encoding. In particular, it draws attention to the importance of unsigned works, as distinct from anonymous works, and “open secrets” of authorship. As with Smith, I close the chapter with a consideration of Robinson herself as an author.</Text>
            <Comments>For example, several attempts at statistical authorship attribution have, rather than clarifying a singular author for a piece, instead pointed to the essential role of collaboration.  In particular, I will discuss the interesting recent failures to identify the unknown negative reviewer of Coleridge’s Christabel.</Comments>

            <Text>Mary Robinson

“Even as she published six novels, several collections of poetry and various political and prose tracts, she could never escape from the burden of an unremitting social notoriety” (69)

“This pattern of reception — with its foregrounding of the ubiquitous sexual narrative — extended well into the twentieth century; it was Robinson’s status as ‘Perdita’ which created a interest in her life and writing and invested them with cultural currency, with biographical studies plotting her life mainly around the axis of emotional engagement … This kind of biographical/historical assessment has received a recent corrective with the publication of Paula Byrne’s biography of Robinson. While chronicling a life of celebrity… Byrne also provides a serious discussion of her authorship.” (70)

“There was, however, another pattern of reception that accompanied the publication of Robinson’s work in her own time as well. There, her support of radical issues did attract attentuon … The comments of Mathias, Heath, Bisset, Gifford, and Polwhele are significant, as they point to a contemporary awareness of, and identification between, Robinson and a certain political strand. And yet, in dissociating Robinson’s politics from her poetry, Gifford also expresses a critical view … that links her radicalism exclusively to her later novels. Thus, while for these observers Robinson’s public presence was more than that of actress, mistress, and celebrity, they ignore the political import of the texts that she wrote during the early 1790s, when she was conspicuously under the burden of celebrity status.” (71)

“an identification with victimhood at times displaces the adherence to a specific political agenda, such as in Robinson’s support of and identification with Marie Antoinette” (71) — is ‘adherence to an agenda’ the right way to think about politics?

“Anne Mellow, in presenting Robinson as a ‘script of female sexuality’, has argued that the different ways Robinson’s subjectivity was constructed in contemporary narratives as well as her performative enactment of authorship indicate that ‘her identity — personal and authorial — can be nothing more nor less than the sum total of / the scripts she performed both in public and in private, n her own narratives and in those of others.’ Mellor’s recognition of the fluidity of Robinson’s authorial identity [NOTE: FLUIDITY IS NOT WHAT MELLOR DESCRIBES] is underscored most forcefully in the ways that Robinson affixes her name to her published work. The fact that her writing was disseminated under various names and personae (Laura Maria, Oberon and Tabitha Bramble, among others) as well as anonymously, contributes to the sense of ‘performance’ that accompanies her literary career, and complicates the attempt to locate the presence of a political awareness in its aggregate.” (71-2)</Text>

            <Text>“the data I can legally provide— lists of word frequencies associated with each volume or ctional character— should allow intrepid readers to retrace the most debatable parts of the argument. An argument that can be retraced in this manner is “reproducible.”” (173)
“If my conclusions hold true in dierent subsets of the literary past, they are not just reproducible but “replicable.”” (174)

“Debates about distant reading have often centered on controversy about the construc-tion of data. But I believe this is now a residual controversy, hang-ing on beyond the period when it made sense. It has lingered be-cause the term distant reading is still dened, for many scholars, by the polemical context that surrounded it in the year 2000, when it seemed to be the culmination of a long argument over the canon. e pathos of a title like Franco Moretti’s “Slaughter-house of Literature” came from the implication that existing re-covery projects had been inadequate. Of course, Moretti also said that his goal was not simply to expand coverage. e real point was rather a new form of comparative analysis made possible by expansion. “Slaughterhouse,” for instance, contrasts Arthur Conan Doyle to his contemporary rivals. But in the polemical context of the canon wars, this emphasis on comparison was not the part of Moretti’s argument that got heard; what got heard  / instead was a forceful claim that critics’ bookshelves had to be replaced by the whole library.” (174-5)
A claim of that kind was guaranteed to annoy several dierent audiences. In defense of canonical works, many scholars replied that widely discussed books may be more important than others: surely a representative sample of the past would assign dier-ent weight to dierent volumes? Scholars interested in minority literatures replied that historical injustices have left some groups underrepresented in libraries. An indiscriminately comprehen-sive collection of books might continue to allow those voices to be drowned out. Finally, book historians perceived Moretti’s dis-cussion of the slaughterhouse as a simplied version of their own long- standing argument that criticism of great works ignores lit-erary circulation. is is not a problem that can be solved simply by multiplying titles. As Katherine Bode has explained, a collec-tion dated by rst publication will never capture the temporality of reading practices, which are free to range over the whole past.All of this is true. Every sampling method has limitations, and these are the limitations of a sample that tries to include one copy of every title, dated by first publication. If distant reading meant a belief that such samples are the only valid way to represent the past, then these limitations would constitute an argument against distant reading. But quantitative inquiry about literary history has never, in reality, limited itself to a single representation of the past. Sometimes distant readers take the whole library as it stands, but often we select subsets, in order to contrast them.” (175)
“In short, large- scale literary research is necessarily comparative. Distant readers often explicitly test their claims against several dierent samples of the literary past, as I have done for instance in the second half of chapter 4. But even when an argu-ment relies on a single data set, quantitative researchers implicitly understand its claims as part of a larger conversation, organized by a goal of replicability that entails comparisons between dif-ferent kinds of samples. Critiques of distant reading that argue for or against a particular sampling strategy miss their target by misunderstanding the shape of this conversation. I am respond-ing to those critiques in an appendix because I think they are well- intentioned red herrings.” (176)

“Why have critics of distant reading overlooked its comparative dimension and portrayed different collections of books instead as competing alternatives? … this is an assumption we inherit from the last few decades of the twentieth century. e critical interventions of that period did commonly aim to displace one object of study with another, presented as better mirroring social reality. When canons were at issue, the struggle to define a single representative list was motivated by the limitations of space that force anthologies and syllabi to distill the past down to a single / set of texts. In such a confined space, the games critics play are genuinely zero- sum in character: new canons can come into be-ing only by displacing old ones.” (176-7)
“Moretti’s turn- of- the- century articles sometimes follow the same rules and propose to replace the canon with a new object of study. That move turned out to be an effective way to focus literary scholars’ attention. But it was also an anomaly in the larger history of quantitative literary study, which has not usually centered on debates about the canon. Once researchers have created digital collections of several thousand titles, it becomes unnecessary to decide on a single representation of the past, since digital collections are easy to subdivide and rebalance. A collection of this sort is analogous to a library, not to a syllabus or anthology: it doesn’t replace one version of the past with another but provides an enlarged repertoire of options. Instead of arguing about samples as if they were competing canons, we can adopt a relational mode of reasoning about literary history, akin to the methods of social science.” (177)

“Since I approach sampling in this pluralistic way, the data un-derpinning this study has not been organized around a single master list of representative books. Instead, each chapter devel-ops a dierent sample, to address a dierent question. Of course, it would be a lot of work for researchers to construct new samples completely from scratch for every project. So, in practice, digital libraries provide an important resource, allowing researchers to construct dierent samples by subdividing a larger collection. In pursuing work of this kind, we don’t necessarily have to decide whether libraries are correctly balanced. We can rebalance our samples as needed. But we do have to spend some time thinking about the outer limits of the collection. In this book, for instance, the texts I use are mostly drawn from HathiTrust Digital Li-brary. While a sixteen- million- volume collection is not severely conning, it does have limits worth thinking about, since (as we saw in chapter ) the library includes only about half the ction titles mentioned in Publishers Weekly. More importantly, cover-age varies across time; it becomes distinctly less complete as we move forward to the twentieth century, especially in the period beyond 1923. As we look at changes across a long timeline, we should remain aware that we’re looking at a sample of varying social breadth.” (178)

“Other distant readers have been similarly cautious, compar-ing various samples of the literary eld— canonical or obscure, including reprints or excluding them. Caution of this kind will always remain necessary. But we should also be frank about the size of the dierence it has made so far. Cautious comparison of different sampling strategies has almost never changed distant readers’ conclusions about century- spanning trends. Century- spanning” is the key phrase in that sentence. If we set out to create a complete and balanced picture of a single de-cade, the list of volumes we choose will matter a great deal. But I have argued throughout this book that the salient strength of distant reading is to reveal arcs of change across long timelines. For that goal, many dierent samples are often equally appro-priate. Trends that shape two hundred years of literary history are usually reected in every part of the literary eld.” (179)
“To be sure, there are also interesting things we can learn by comparing samples. For instance, researchers at both Illinois and Stanford have noticed that canonical works are commonly fteen or twenty years ahead of the curve. at’s a telling detail, likely to repay further investigation; chapter  of this volume can be understood as an attempt to unpack the implications. But a dif-ference of fteen years between more and less prominent writers doesn’t undermine our initial observation that, for instance, liter-ary production as a whole has been moving toward concrete de-scription for two centuries. at remains true, whichever sample we choose.” (180)

“while we continue to think cautiously about sampling and data construction, I would recommend allocating a bit more anxiety to the disciplinary blind spots that wreck our arguments / more often. Researchers should share code, report eect sizes, and measure uncertainty where possible.” (180-181)
“In this book, for instance, ef-fect sizes have been measured as correlation coecients or model accuracies; uncertainty has been measured both through resam-pling and by testing dierent interpretive assumptions. I have also spent much of this book arguing that supervised models should be preferred to arbitrary measurements that aim to “op-erationalize” a concept. In practice, I think these methodological questions make a bigger dierence than the questions about data construction critics have tended to dwell on.” (181)

“at being said, the next stage of research in distant reading probably does involve a richer and more careful sort of sampling. We will want to gather more social evidence, especially about reception, so we can subdivide samples more carefully, describe shorter timelines more richly, and in some cases move toward causal explanation of literary change. is volume takes a few tentative steps in that direction, but there is a great deal more to be done. At the same time, we can expand our samples of literature by lling gaps, improving texts, and correcting dates. Our existing digital libraries are undeniably imperfect. Optical transcription of eighteenth- century books is so bad that it re-mains hard to do certain kinds of research in the period. Pulp magazines are not well covered, and more generally, it is not easy to extract a single story or article from a serial. Languages other than English are not always well served; within English litera-ture, ethnic minorities need richer representation. Metadata are imperfect: in this book I have usually limited my collection to the earliest copy of each title, but in chapters  and , working with hundreds of thousands of volumes, I have not rigorously dated everything by rst publication.” (181)

“So when I write “the texts in this book are mostly drawn from HathiTrust,” I am describing a messy process that stretched over several years. In collaboration with graduate students and sta at HathiTrust Research Center, I had to rst identify volumes of poetry and ction (algorithmically, because metadata are sparse) and then separate the poetry or ctional text from tables of con-tents, ads, running heads, and prefaces. Whenever possible, I also corrected optical transcription errors (so hiftory becomes history) and normalized spelling to modern British practice (so color becomes colour, physick becomes physic, and to- day becomes today).” (182)

“I am condent that there are still thousands of er-rors in my data, both in the texts and in the metadata. I know, for instance, that a small fraction of books I have listed as c-tion are really biographies or travel writing. In chapters where I work with a few thousand volumes (2 and 3), I can groom the metadata manually to a fairly high standard, but it isn’t possible to do that for the hundreds of thousands of books used in chap-ters 1 and 4. Research on that scale is about measuring error, not eliminating it.” (182)

“Of course, this also raises the bar for signicant criticism. Having gone to great lengths to make it possible for skeptics to prove me wrong, I think it is fair to expect that they actually do so. When an author has shared code and voluminous data, it is no longer enough to draw up a list of scattered errors and omissions that might— who knows?— have altered the book’s conclusions. Armed with the author’s code, a critic who nds a genuinely consequential over-sight should be able to take the next step and demonstrate that it was in fact consequential.I fully expect that to happen: this book will turn out to be wrong on some topics. e goal of experimental inquiry is not to get everything right the rst time but to advance knowledge in a way that invites further testing and renement. In fact, if long arcs of literary change are as hard to perceive as I have claimed, then I ought to have misunderstood them in some way.” (183)

“I also know that the data I have shared will need to be im-proved by other hands. In writing this book, I was divided be-tween two goals. I wanted to work with publicly available texts and build data sets that could be borrowed by other researchers. But I was also concerned not to repeat an error that I think has stalled quantitative scholarship in the past: a preoccupation with precision so meticulous that researchers end up correcting texts,  / perfecting markup, and in general laying groundwork for an in-definite future instead of actually making an impact on the field of literary history. So, while I spent years correcting this data, I stopped as soon as it became good enough to answer the broad questions about change envisioned in this book. Scholars who want to address dierent questions may need to further enrich and correct my data sets or develop their own.” (183-4)
“I am not sure that I struck the right compromise between the imperatives to produce data for others and to advance my own immediate thesis. But I do feel condent that a compromise of some kind is necessary. We need to keep improving digital collections. But in order to motivate that work, we also need to show that our collections, as they stand, are already capable of address-ing important questions.” (184)

“the point of numbers in social science is not to impose determinism but to acknowledge uncertainty.” (186)

“statistics didn’t be-come useful for us [i.e., humanists] until rather late in the game.” (187-88) — humanists didn’t adopt 2-3 variable stats because that didn’t help with our problems.

“Instead of envision-ing the modeling process as directly fitting and representing a simpler structure underlying the data, it makes more sense to acknowledge that we are selecting a model that makes accurate predictions, without any proof that the inner workings of the model mirror deep structures in the world.” (190)

“I do want to push back against a rhetorical turn, common on both sides of this debate, that tends to exag-gerate the enigmatic and opaque character of predictive models.” (190)
“More fundamentally, the whole premise of a choice between prediction and explanation may be phantasmic in fields like the humanities where we have never possessed simple explanatory models. … in the humanities, we have rarely produced streamlined explanations of any kind— and certainly not simple mathemati-cal equations. So it is not entirely clear that “prediction versus explanation” is a real trade- o for us, or a painful choice. In fact, for many humanistic questions, winnowing the variables to iden-/tify a few key factors is not even an interesting goal. For instance, it is not especially hard to nd the key variable that distinguishes masculine and feminine characters in ction. Hint: they are de-scribed with dierent pronouns. ”(191-2)
“I often encounter arguments about quantitative method that seem to be founded on an implicit hierarchy of cognitive tasks, where mere pattern recognition is easy, prediction may be more interesting, but explanation is the real prize. I don’t think that hierarchy holds up well in historical disciplines, since historical patterns are not easy to perceive and it is not safe to assume that they have a single explanation.” (192)

“So the primary workhorse of this book has been regularized logistic regression. This algorithm is widely used for text clas-sication and has an accuracy closely comparable to SVMs. But it also works in an intuitive way that is relatively easy to explain. Most crucially, it excels at calibrating its degree of confidence about dierent observations, which is a feature I used heavily in the illustrations for chapters 2 and 3.” (193)

“Examining the gures in chap-ter 2 and chapter 3, a reader may notice that models of genre have volumes clustering near the top and bottom of the image, whereas models of literary prestige have volumes sprinkled more evenly across the space. Fundamentally, this is because prestige is harder to model than genre. So the best models of prestige end / up needing a lot of regularization and have relatively low con-dence on average.” (195-6)

“Having attempted to reproduce the result, so far without success, I am tentatively skeptical about the importance attributed to conditional entropy in Algee- Hewitt et al., “Canon/Archive.”” (196)</Text>

            <Text>In the next section I will close-read the implicit models underlying each database, to examine how each enforces a particular concept of “literature” and “a text.” However, before these models can make sense, we must understand the history of how they were built. I contend that each database is best understood as a negotiation between commercial and noncommercial values. Each database has the goal of making valuable information available. After the 1990s, they are particularly influenced by the utopian ideal that digital reproduction at last made textual reproduction free. Each had to contend, however, with the fact that before a text can be reproduced digitally it must be created digitally, and that even if the material costs are entirely eliminated (which, of course, they are not) textual creation continues to have costs in labour.

[The histories of these databases currently run to more than 9,000 words of bare recitations of facts. My next steps are to further clarify some of the details, and to frame and narrativize the information to make it meaningful.]

But “publication” doesn’t apply to works that circulated widely in manuscript form — date from the first time a copy was “distributed” to someone other than the author? (What about, e.g., Percy editing Frankenstein? Other manuscript works were surely revised in response to feedback, but Mary giving Percy a copy doesn’t feel like “publication”.)
Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren’t likely to be fully useful. I like first publication to reflect when the work became less inchoate and entered into a broader literary conversation — this is the point at which chronological connections seem most likely to be informative.</Text>

            <Text>The TCP’s very partial successes are perhaps most visible when we contrast the TCP with Project Gutenberg, which has operated since its inception without collaborating with the commercial sector. The Project Gutenberg mission has always been focused on freely giving away things which were acknowledged to have financial value. After all, Hart’s goal was to “pay back” the $100,000,000 he had been given in computing time — giving away ebooks would generate and give away this financial value. But even in seeking to “pay back” there is an impulse behind Project Gutenberg which exceeds ideas of monetary value. The explanatory documents of the project, when it became a major volunteer undertaking in the 1990s, read like a manifesto:
“Encourage the Creation and Distribution of eBooks
Help Break Down the Bars of Ignorance and Illiteracy
Give As Many eBooks to As Many People As Possible” (History-Computer)
These goals are not so dissimilar to those of public libraries.

“As Barbara Quint, editor of Searcher, said to me after reading some Gutenberg texts: "It struck me how noble, how wonderful, how great-spirited the people who made this all possible were. The time, the tedium, the labor it would take to render a book digital from a print copy." Further, she noted, "It's all a reminder of how much of what is the best on the Web and the Net comes from the kindness of strangers.”” (Hane)</Text>

            <Title>"good" and "bad" texts</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

Popular radical print culture: ‘the more public the better’

Page 35:
Founded in January 1792 by a London shoemaker, Thomas Hardy, and a group of friends, the LCS is commonly seen as the key organisation in the emergence of a new kind of popular radicalism.

Page 35:
Proposing an unlimited membership and charging a cheap subscription rate of one penny per week, the LCS aimed to broaden the processes of political discussion and the printed circulation of ideas.

Page 35:
Modern historians, especially since the revival of scholarly interest in popular conservatism in the 1980s, have been inclined to celebrate the initiative displayed by the LCS, but disparage a perceived lack of cogency in its political platform.

Page 35:
The fact of major differences within the reform movement is undeniable, but that is hardly a surprise if we examine any reform or revolutionary movement, successful or otherwise. In the case of the 1790s, this diversity reflects the experimental nature of the movement as it faced a range of new possibilities in the wake of the American and French Revolutions.

Page 36
Page 36:
If the LCS and its members critiqued the theatricality of Pitt and others as an empty show, a shabby trick played to deceive the people, they also insisted on their right to produce a drama of their own, with starring roles for radical celebrities.

Page 36:
My approach thinks of the LCS in relation to language as embedded in social practices and understands contests over those practices as essential to the politics of the radical movement. The LCS is read not as some absolutely coherent agent, but as a locus for the circulation of print structured by reading, meetings, lectures, conversazione, various encounters in bookshops and many other spaces in the associational world of eighteenth-century London.

Page 36:
the politics of the radical societies may not lie simply with the speech act in the text, but in ‘the very act of publication’.

Page 36:
If this book ends with a defeat of a kind in the passage of the Two Acts through Parliament at the end of 1795, then the triumph of the radicalism of the 1790s was the creation of a popular

Page 37
Page 37:
politics that extended into the nineteenth century.

Page 37:
Over 1793–4, as John Barrell has shown, Pitt’s ministry began to construe these arguments not only as seditious but also treasonable in so far as they presented the popular societies as more legitimately representing the people than Parliament.

Page 38
Page 38:
Eley may be right to note that ‘the advanced democracy of the LCS presumed the very maturity and sophistication it was meant to create’.

Page 38:
the struggle to create a democratic culture in the popular societies was a sustained and extraordinarily rich response that seriously alarmed the government of the day and prompted it to take measures.12 Many contemporaries – not only radicals – regarded these measures as both unnecessary and unprecedented.

Page 38:
Charles James Fox described Pitt’s measures culminating in the Two Acts as a ‘Reign of Terror’.

Page 38:
The most obvious fruit of the collaboration between the LCS and the SCI was the circulation of cheap editions of Paine’s Rights of Man, but their relationship continued in one form or another, and with different degrees of intensity, from 1792 until the treason trials at the end of 1794.

Page 39
Page 39:
Some key individuals, for instance, Joseph Gerrald, were members of both societies

Page 40
Page 40:
The question of how a distinctive republic of letters could have emerged from such places remained an enigma to a ruling elite

Page 40:
Radical print culture in the 1790s was structured as much by tensions between its members as their cooperative will to change their world for the better.

Page 40:
The disorientating speed of events that the French Revolution unleashed across Europe further complicated things, as participants had to decide upon the significance of those events for their sense of what was possible in the British situation.

Page 40:
When we examine the archive of the radical movement in London, a picture emerges of less-heralded individual members of the LCS and SCI also revising their sense of the possibilities before them, even if the official line of the societies stuck to the Duke of Richmond’s plan of universal suffrage and annual parliaments as their immediate objective.

Page 40:
John Horne Tooke famously described his attitude to reform in terms of getting off the Windsor coach at Hounslow, even if his fellow passengers intended to proceed to the terminus. The LCS encouraged all the societies to get on the stage to Richmond and debate the final destination once on board.

Page 40:
hey continually recycled resources from the past, often quite literally by republishing the duke’s plan from the 1780s, or even earlier texts from the commonwealth canon.

Page 40:
The cutting and pasting techniques that were essential to the rapid-fire achievement of periodicals like Thomas Spence’s Pig’s Meat (1793–5) or Eaton’s Politics for the People (1793–5) did not simply endorse the texts they reproduced, but implicitly transformed them in the interests of raising the political consciousness of their readers.</Text>

            <Title>these are all databases</Title>
            <Text>The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)

What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.
A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.
Another approach is to ignore the categories and use things like topic modelling; relies on a more intimate knowledge of the information being studies (i.e., humanities expertise)</Text>

            <Text>Chapter two begins by examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. I make the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begin the process of revealing and interrogating their structural assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of digital eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s). I begin by simply attempting to establish how many titles each database includes from each year, 1789-99. Answering this basic demographic question will also illustrate the nature of each resource’s data structures, and allow the first comparisons between them. I am particularly interested to see which resources have ‘spikes’ in 1790 and 1795, years which are often assigned to works of uncertain date. I will also check each database for my four key authors. For each author I compile, based largely on non-digital resources, a list of every edition of every work that they published during this decade. Manually comparing each digital resource against this comprehensive list allows me to spot-check the completeness and accuracy of the corpus. I am particularly interested to see which works by each author are most widely distributed, and how successfully each corpus handles ambiguities of authorship. As I compare corpora to each other, I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I research the history of how each corpus was formed. As part of this process, I also discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I discuss the nature of the works they do not contain.  The second chapter thus establishes the contents and limitations of the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.</Text>
            <Comments>For example, how many unsigned works, or works published under pseudonyms, are correctly attributed? Are there any mistakes made between Ann Radcliffe and Ann Ward Radcliffe? Do they unify Charlotte Smith and Charlotte Turner Smith? Exploring these questions through authors with whom I am deeply familiar can indicate the error rates of the corpus as a whole.</Comments>

            <Text>“Chapter  explores the history of characterization, looking in particular at the way ctional characters are shaped by implicit assumptions about gender.” (xvi) “I have been able to show that the implicit gendering of character grows steadily blurrier from 1840 to the present. More interesting, of course, are the specic details that signify gender. ese are not always obvious: in the middle of the twentieth century, it suddenly becomes feminine to smile but masculine to grin. Perhaps most interesting of all: the details that predict a character’s gender turn out to be extremely volatile.” (xvii)

“Historians of literature obviously need a bit more distance from ction. But we also want to connect our history to readers’ experience— which means that we need some way of connect-ing historical trends to the imaginary people and events inside the volumes. is was relatively easy as long as we were work-ing with a repertoire of forty or sixty books commonly taken to represent (say) the Victorian novel. We could just point to Heathcli or Maggie Tulliver. But in a century- spanning story covering thousands of works, it becomes dicult to pretend that a few characters are representative. We need some way of reasoning collectively about hundreds of thousands of fictional people.” (111)
He’s framing things as essentially narrative problems, treating criticism itself almost as a genre rather than a methodology

Methodology rather casually points to some limitations (no characters without names, some nicknames split into multiple characters, no first-person narrators) without addressing how they might affect interpretation — dispensed with out of sheer technological necessity

“In the middle of the nineteenth century, very different language is used to describe ctional men and women. But that dierence weakens steadily as we move forward to the pres-ent; the actions and attributes of characters are less clearly sorted into gender categories. is may sound like a progressive story: a character’s role in a narrative is increasingly independent of his or her public gender identity. But the second trend this chapter will describe points in a different direction. If we trace the sheer space on the page allotted to women, we discover a startling de-cline both in the number of characters who are women or girls and in the percentage of a text writers devote to describing them. In short, while gender roles were becoming more exible, the attention actually devoted to women was declining. If we look more closely at the details of this story, however, the paradox may be only apparent. We may even begin to understand how both trends could emerge from the same underlying cause” (114)

“We represent each character by the adjectives that modify them, the verbs they govern, and so  on— excluding only words that explicitly name a gendered role like boyhood or wife. en we present characters, labeled with grammatical gender, to a learning algorithm. e algorithm will learn what it means to be “masculine” or “feminine” purely by observing what men and women actually do in stories.” (115) — use of these stopwords seems fraught and inspires skepticism; he addresses this later

“the major limitation of all libraries, where gender is concerned, is very simple: men wrote more of the books than women.” (117)

“Gender boundaries are consistently more predictable in books by men, across the whole timeline we are considering. Gender is consistently harder to infer in books written by women.” (117)

“I think it may be relatively easy to understand the arc in Figure 4.1. Explanations for it are handy. On the other hand, it would be an overstatement to say that “we already knew” the shape of the arc. In truth, we don’t know it even now. Other projects using similar methods have reached different conclusions. … even when a quantitative result roughly conrms one plausible set of expectations, it doesn’t mean that we already had consensus on the topic.” (118)

“we tested the reliability of BookNLP’s gender inference by comparing the predicted gender to manual judgments for 525 characters evenly distributed over time to make sure the perceived decline in accuracy wasn’t merely a decline in the reliability of our ground truth. In short, the blurring of gender boundaries from 1840 through the late twentieth century is a robust trend; it is not likely to vanish with a different set of sampling or modeling choices.” (119)

“So pulling all this together, what can we conclude? Some forms of gender dierentiation (associated for instance with do-mestic space and subjectivity) are declining, while other forms (associated for instance with the body and clothes) are on the rise. If we add them all together, we can say generally that gender is less insistently marked by the end of the twentieth century than it was in the 1840s. But that slow increase in blurriness could be less important than the churn we have seen along the way: the rise and fall of dierent forms of gender dierentiation. Al-though the opposition of he and she remains grammatically the same, gender is actually quite a dierent thing by 2007 than it had been in 1840.” (125)

“So far we have considered books in the aggregate, in order to show, for instance, that gender roles become less predictable as time passes. But there were in reality huge dierences between books and authors at every point on the timeline. How signicant is the historical trend relative to the variation between works?” (126)

#

“It turns out that women are consistently under-represented in books by men. On average, only a third of the words men use in characterization are used to describe feminine characters. Women writers, on the other hand, spend equal time on fictional men and fictional women. This difference remains depressingly constant across two centuries, and it may help explain why books by men tend to have more stereotyped gender roles.” (127)
“Admittedly, this principle doesn’t fully explain male writers’ obsession with gender. If we compare books by men and women with similar fractions of female characters, the books by men will still have slightly starker gender polarities. In short, everything affects everything: as usual with statistics, there is no single cause. But the underrepresentation of women in books by men may be one reason for the stark gender dimorphism in those books.” (128)

“Genre also, surprisingly, doesn’t matter as much as one might assume. I have investigated detective stories, Westerns, romances, and works of science fiction. Although the role of gender in characterization does vary from one genre to the next, it does so, for the most part, roughly as one might predict from the gender identification of the authors themselves. Characters in Westerns are more clearly gendered than usual (but not much more clearly than one would predict for books written by men). Characters in romances are less clearly gendered (but about average for books written by women). This result for romances will perhaps sound surprising, since gothic romances of the late twentieth century have sometimes been accused of foregrounding and reinforcing  / conventional gender roles. But the evidence I have seen suggests that gender boundaries in romance are less predictable than in, say, Westerns” (128-9)

“e steady dwindling of the gap separating ctional women and men is all the more interesting because it stands in tension with the durable gap between men and women as authors. is evidence almost seems to be saying: “Gender itself may be a volatile con-struct, but when it comes to acknowledging the volatility, women writers are consistently twenty- ve years ahead of men.” at would be a self- contradictory statement, to be sure, but it may be a contradiction worth exploring.” (131)

The Masculinization of Fiction, 1850– 1970
“But we can also pose simpler questions about gender. For instance, what proportion of ctional characters are actually identied as women or girls?e shrinking gap between masculine and feminine roles seen in the rst half of the chapter might lead us to predict a simi-larly upbeat pattern here, with the prominence of women slowly increasing across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.” (131)
“In fact, the prominence of women steadily declines in English- language ction from the middle of the nineteenth cen-tury to the middle of the twentieth.” (132) (based on words used to describe women and what they’re doing, eg their verbs. “However one measures it, the space allotted to women declines from the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth— in the very period when we might expect to see the eects of rst- wave feminism. e trend reverses around 1970, for reasons we will investigate later.” (132)\

“Women go from representing almost half the authors of fiction to less than a quarter. If this trend is real, it is an important fact about literary history that ought to be foregrounded even, say, in anthology introductions. But the story has not been widely pub-licized.” (133) — how does this compare to the 18thC?

“It appears that scholars of each period are able to see the possibility that female authorship was declining in their own period. But no one has been willing to advance the dismal suggestion that the whole story from 1850 to 1970 was a story of decline.” (135)

“Because literary historians have a special professional interest in ction, we may be tempted to view the decline of women’s participation in that genre as a barometer of equality generally. If that were true, it would be puzzling to see this index of equality declining in the very period when characters’ lives in-side ction were becoming less sharply gendered. But authorship of ction is actually a poor measure of equality at large. In the early nineteenth century, when the novel was eectively a ghetto for intellectual women, women’s dominance of ction is in part a measure of their segregation. It may not be puzzling at all that increased exibility of gender roles inside ction would coincide with a ight into other genres.” (138)

The chapter has “revealed major new patterns” without offering particularly novel explanations (138).

“e same pattern has appeared in several other chapters: this book’s real innovations have often been descriptive rather than explanatory. is is odd, because in many familiar situations de-scription precedes explanation. I can describe my symptoms eas-ily, but I need a doctor to diagnose them. A high school student can describe a book’s plot, but explaining its historical inuences may strain even a professor.When we back up to look at two hundred years, I would sug-gest, we are confronting a problem of a basically dierent kind. On this scale, description is far from easy. In many cases, we have failed to sketch basic trends, because two centuries simply don’t fit in a human memory. Quantitative evidence may have to be gathered before description can begin. On the other hand, numbers are not particularly good at unraveling causality on a scale of centuries. There are often many causal factors involved in a single trend; across a long timeline, they may all correlate with each other uninformatively. So causal questions are often better addressed by closely analyzing a few cases, and existing qualita-tive scholarship has often done that rather well. … we should not be surprised to find that quantitative analysis sometimes reveals unexpected patterns— for which we already have several good explanations handy.” (139)

“But there will certainly be cases where quantitative evidence uncovers puzzles that still lack an explanation. is chapter has revealed, for instance, a puzzling tension between the uidity of gender in ction and the stability of authorial behavior. Fic-tive representations of gender seem to be quite volatile. In the nineteenth century femininity is expressed through description of the heart; in the twentieth century, through description of hair. Nineteenth- century men have houses; twentieth- century men have pockets. Moreover, the importance of these dier-ences, collectively, varies greatly across time. On the other hand, there are strangely durable dierences between men and women as authors. For two hundred years, men consistently drew more sharply gendered characters than women and consistently under-represented women in their ctional worlds. is paradox de-serves more discussion than I can give it here. But one possible conclusion would be that the structural positions of masculine and feminine identity, vis- à- vis each other, have remained very stable— while the actual content of masculinity and femininity has been entirely mutable.” (140)</Text>

            <Text>How do scholarly collections of texts represent or otherwise relate to collectives of people? How does the work of some groups of people come to be underrepresented or overrepresented in these collections?  Much  scholarly work has been driven by the conviction that textual canons are related human communities, and thus that there is urgent political and social importance to academic textual selection and textual reproduction. John Guillory’s Cultural Capital argues that despite the rhetoric of pluralism, the representation of texts in a literary canon is not identical to, or even directly translatable to, representation of groups of people. The inclusion that matters is the inclusion of people within the institutions of textual production — publishing houses, academic departments, libraries, and classrooms. The ability of these institutions to selectively reproduce some texts over others, in a world shaped by social hierarchies of many kinds, is never irrelevant. The question of which texts ought to be selected, and whether current selections are just, is insoluble in part because it addresses a moving target: canonical texts seem stable, but canons change frequently to meet new social needs. My dissertation examines the extent to which digital databases of literature do and do not function according to the logic of literary canons. Like printed canons, these databases, especially the smaller ones, are vulnerable to a critique of their selection methods on the grounds of representation. However, unlike the various literary canons, digital databases tend to conceal which particular titles have been selected as representative. Moreover, digital corpora are used to support very different claims about the world than those which are implied by an anthology or a syllabus. Although many productive questions can be formed by treating  digital textual collections as analogous to printed canons, therefore, the most useful answers to those questions will arise from an attention to the unique affordances of digital media, those features that mean they operate institutionally unlike canons.
 It is often extremely difficult to know what is in a digital corpus of texts, whether is it an institutional resource (like the British Library’s Digitized Books) or an individual scholar’s collection of works for a particular research question (like Franco Moretti’s collections of “detective fiction”). Even large resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. Indeed, the larger a resource, the less likely these inclusions will be framed as choices at all, as the implicit selection factor of availability in university libraries dominates all other considerations. As emerging work in critical algorithm studies by scholars like Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Safiya Noble has shown, these hidden choices are particularly problematic when they not only replicate but intensify patterns of historical exclusion. My research focuses specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to explore how works from this eleven-year “decade” have been selected as important, literary, or popular. The late eighteenth century is a thematically resonant moment for the questions I ask. This period saw a rapid increase in the volume of texts being published, and many expressed alarm and uncertainty about changes in who was now reading and writing. For this decade, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts — the source for most distant reading research on eighteenth century literature — includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent the written work produced by women?
My experiments examine five major databases to answer these questions: The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. For each database, I calculate how many works printed in England 1789-1799 are attributed to male, female, or unknown authors, and compare the representation of broad categories of writing like poetry, drama, prose fiction, sermons, non-fiction, and ephemera. Identifying these categories of writing within each database reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry (rather than non-fiction or sermons) in the smaller databases. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in, for example, gender representation. If novels are mostly written by women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by under-representing novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of selection.
This work also allows me to interrogate the rhetoric of “representation” which has driven much of the conversation around both canons and digital databases. Franco Moretti’s “Conjectures on World Literature” famously proposes that computational “distant reading” could “solve” the problem of literary canons. Twenty years later, Ted Underwood’s Distant Horizons argues that this goal as now been abandoned as ill-conceived, and that no important results actually emerged. But I do not consider this a passé area of inquiry; I see Moretti’s failure at the site of his methods, not in his core question. A close interrogation of Moretti’s work, particularly his most controversial claims, shows striking lacunae and obfuscations in his corpus-building. This is where the logic of “representation” remains of urgent import: as the grounds from which we attempt to determine truths about the literary history, and cultural history, that matters. Here, I follow Kath Bode in continuing to re-examine the core assumptions of distant reading research. Like Bode, I lean in to what I see as the natural connections between distant reading and bibliography, to address macroanalytic questions in ways which do not erase or gloss over textual history. By applying the frameworks of critical algorithm studies of the bibliographic records of the 1790s, I examine not only how women’s writing was represented within the printed media of the eighteenth century, but how current research infrastructure represents or marginalizes particular writing communities today.</Text>

            <Text>Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.
 The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to facsimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience flying to California in order to be taught about HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible.
Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.

            <Title>debt vs credit</Title>
            <Text>It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit
It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing to promise repayment) and then 80% of the time we’re told that he did follow up and repay
Are the screeds against debt in the same works...? I’ll have to check, but I THINK there’s a distinction being made between “credit” (which is tied to social credibility) and “debt” (which is seen as impersonal and with near-mystical properties)
Similarly peasants can live like 5 years in a cottage without paying rent and they’ll get around to it when the landlord asks them, and this too is not “debt”, in fact at the start of the century it’s a narrative marker of cruelty for the landlord to insist on the rent being paid
Ok, those are my thoughts on credit vs debt as part of the shift from parochial economies to imperial market capitalism</Text>

            <Text>Ch 1: This chapter focuses on the writing of the 1790s and illustrates the role that poetry played in the effort to mobilize Great Britain against France and to resist that mobilisation. If poetry was linked to other cultural forms in this struggle over the war in the decade that followed the French Revolution, it was also a form for which special claims were made, often presented in gendered terms. Poetry's links with ‘fancy,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘feeling’ were seen to make it crucial for representing the war and poets constantly called on these faculties as vital to their own representational strategies and to their readers' ability to respond to their visions of conflict. While poetry's feminised powers were frequently invoked, the wartime reconceptions and reformulations of poetry were often presented as a need for poetry to become more manly, a major factor in the remasculinisation of poetry in the romantic period.
Ch 2: This chapter discusses the poetic imaginings of war in the 1790s, particularly those of Charlotte Smith and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Smith's reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the 18th century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. In Fears in Solitude, Coleridge addresses a nation distant from the scene of conflict and ultimately offers his own imagining as a model for the nation. The imagining of war, then, plays a major role in the development of the romantic imagination.
Ch 3: This chapter discusses the war and poetic identity in the writings of Robert Southey and Wordsworth. In Southey's blank-verse poem, ‘History,’ he asks himself the repeated question ‘Was it for this…?’ This familiar narrative of an overwhelming sense of personal and political crisis producing a turn away from ‘History,’ often figured as here as a retreat to a bower, has been a major feature of accounts of canonical romanticism, and still holds considerable sway. Like Wordsworth's The Prelude, also begun in 1798 with the repeated question ‘Was it for this…?’, ‘History’ is a poem of poetic dedication at a time of historical crisis, but while history emerges only at the end of the two-book Prelude, in Southey's poem it is ‘History’ itself which offers the solution to the crisis.
Ch 4: This chapter discusses poetry, war, and gender in Wordsworth's political sonnets. Wordsworth's political sonnets of 1802-1803 were part of the huge outpouring of verse produced to unite, inspire, and animate the nation during the invasion scares if 1797-1798 and 1802-1805, the period that has been named ‘the Great Terror.’ This vast body of verse played an important role in the wartime forging of the British nation, both mediating the war to the British public and providing a means of patriotic expression. If poetry shaped understandings of the war in these years, the war in turn shaped poetry, limiting the kinds of writing that could be produced in such an atmosphere of national crisis. The chapter also details one example of poetic construction of the manly nation and its links to the remasculinisation of poetry, Wordworth's political sonnets.
Ch 5: This chapter discusses Walter Scott's picturesque romance of war. Scott was the bestselling and most popular poet of the Napoleonic wars and his metrical romances played a crucial role in mediating conflict to a nation at war. His phenomenally successful tales of ‘Border chivalry’ transformed the imagining of war, presenting it as heroic, shaped by the codes of romance, and framed by the conventions of the picturesque. Scott's poetry were about 16th-century wars but became popular during the Napoleonic wars. With his verse, the 18th-century emphasis on war's horrors gives way to the 19th-century stress on its glory. In addressing his readers as ‘Warriors’ in his last extended verse romance in 1814, Scott completed his remasculinisation of the reader and of poetry more generally contributing to the wartime revalidation of poetry as a manly pursuit for both writer and reader.
Ch 6: This chapter discusses the relationship of poetry and the Peninsular War. Robert Southey showed the extent to which the unfolding events in Spain has already been imagined, and written, as romance. Southey was not alone in responding to the war in the Peninsula as already shaped by the representations of ‘poets and romancers.’ The combination of geography and genre in the imaginative shaping of the latest stage of the war was compounded by the fashion for romance produced by the popularity of Walter Scott's poetry which coalesced with the sense of Spain as a land of romance to provide the major poetic framework for the British understanding of the war. The author also examines the poetic use of romance to shape and give meaning to the war, looking at the representational challenges this presented and at the poetic questioning and subversion of this generically inflected understanding of the conflict.
Ch 7: This chapter examines the works of Lord Byron and Felicia Hemans, whose obsession with war developed out of their engagement with the Peninsular War and whose poetic identities were profoundly shaped by their continued reflection on conflict. The chapter also focuses on one way in which these two writers represented war, the siege. They found in the siege a means of representing to their readership the entirety of modern war. The siege illustrates war's effects on the whole of society and it conflates within one site — the fortress, the citadel, or the walled city — the two spaces poetry frequently strives to link, the scene of conflict and the home. Both writers use the siege to explore the relations between war, gender, and history, exploiting the figure siege's rich allegorical and symbolic potential and ultimately find in it a figure for their own poetic identity.


Overall: This opening chapter, which will focus primarily on the writing of the 1790s, will begin by illustrating the role that poetry played in the effort to mobilize the country against France, and to resist that mobilization, But if poetry was linked to other cultural forms including song, theatre, and the visual arts in this struggle over the war in the decade that followed the French Revolution, it was also a form for which special claims were made, an area which will be examined in the second section of this chapter, poetry’s links with ‘fancy’, ‘imagination’, and ‘feeling’ were seen to make it crucial for representing the war and poets constantly called on these faculties as vital to their own representational strategies and to their readers’ ability to respond to their visions of conflict. As 1 will argue in the third section, the special claims made for poetry were often presented in gendered terms, While poetry’s feminized powers (and powers to feminize) were frequently invoked, the wartime reconceptions and refer, nidations of poetry were often presented as a need for poetry to become more manly, a major factor in the remasculinization of poetry in the romantic period. Finally, as an introduction to the major poetic (p.3) transformation in the imagining of war during the conflict, the fourth section will investigate some of the key tropes used to represent the war in the 1790s and the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott.</Text>

Broken records
“A broken record occurs when information added to a record has not been checked against the copies already listed under that record” (Karian 285)

Inaccurate dates
‘The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records—for example, everything from 1720—there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720” (Karian 291)

“only records bibliographic information about surviving books … After a careful study of book advertisements, inventories and bibliographies, it seems to this investigator that, excluding jobbing and newspaper printing, as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701–1800 has not been incorporated into the ESTC.11 In other words, for up to 10 per cent of the editions printed in the eighteenth century, not a single copy is known to survive.” (Suarez 40)</Text>

“the needs of the specialist audience that has formed ESTC’s main constituency in the past and may reasonably be expected to continue as such: the explorers in the field who need detailed maps. In my task of mediating between the file and its users, I find that these people approach early books with questions regarding one or both of two broad topics: intellectual content and physical characteristics, the latter including the location of copies,” with most interested in “the physicality of books.” (Tabor 369)
“When everything is working right, as it does in ESTC more often than not, the bibliographical description is completely accurate as far as it attempts to go, and variations in the matched copies can be reliably determined by the presence or absence of copy-specific notes. If anything happens to disturb the links between the description and its attached holdings, including errors committed in the course of creating the description, the record gets broken and starts telling lies about physical copies or, worse, about the ideal copy” (Tabor 370)

            <Text>EEBO: “unlike scholarly facsimile editions, the selection process for microfilming was often arbitrary. Copies were selected primarily by reference to the copies listed in STC and Wing, with particular preference for certain major collections; they were not selected because they were considered representative of a particular edition. By bringing together the bibliographical record for an edition and (usually but not always) only a single witness of that edition,22 EEBO is obviously aiming to provide a useful scholarly mechanism in terms of searching but by doing so are implying – albeit not deliberately – that the record and the copy are one and the same thing. It would be better, perhaps, if EEBO represented itself as a library of copies, rather than a catalogue of ‘titles’.” (Gadd 687)

EEBO: “in digitising the microfilms in their original forms, EEBO decided (presumably for commercial reasons rather than purely scholarly ones) against sanitising the images. Openings are retained rather than broken into single pages; images are not cropped; rulers, place-holders, and descriptive notes are left in place; blank leaves are not removed. While Kichuk’s concern about ‘remediation’ is a real one, it is difficult to use EEBO for any length of time without being reminded that these are reproductions of actual objects.” (Gadd 688)</Text>

            <Text>Chapter two describes in more detail the databases to be studied, and examines Charlotte Smith and the ways that her writing is made accessible today. The specific experimentation undertaken in chapter two tests the basic assumptions and methods of my project. I begin with a the histories of the ESTC, ECCO, ECCO-TCP, Project Gutenberg, Google Books, and HathiTrust: highlighting the chronological relationships between these resources can explain each database’s scope and technical implementation. Each new resource must contend with the possibility of either competing or collaborating with those which have come before. Examining materials like the meeting minutes and internal communications of these resources’ early histories will show how those which currently enjoy the lowest reputation among scholars — Project Gutenberg and Google Books — defined their initial scope around an explicit rejection of scholarly norms. After establishing the history of each resource’s development, I describe its current digital infrastructure, through the lens of critical algorithm studies. This begins with basic questions: what file formats does it use? What kinds of metadata, what ontologies? How does it make its materials available for use? Through close reading and comparison of these details, I articulate each database’s implicit construction of what a text is and what it is for. Combining each resource’s history with its technical infrastructure, I return to 
Having established these databases as objects of study, I identify what subset of Smith’s works each corpus contains, as a concrete example to compare their holdings overall. Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets, for example, are not included in the ECCO-TCP corpus (which is the one most often used for text mining research) — only Celestina and The Emigrants are included. Why these two texts? And what text mining research based on ECCO-TCP might have found slightly different answers if Smith’s sonnets had been included? As a related test of comparison between databases, for each database which provides access to the actual text of Smith’s works, I compare the textual similarity of Celestina and The Emigrants. What editorial choices are being made? How much worse is the OCR text than the transcribed text? Another key concept I will explore through Smith is the role of reprints. HathiTrust, for example, includes multiple editions of Elegiac Sonnets. How reliable and effective are its distinctions between editions? How do the databases I examine handle multiple editions of a single work? I am particularly interested in how reprints can be incorporated into our understanding of what literature is “of” a particular decade: what does it mean to think of Elegiac Sonnets, initially printed in the 1780s, as “1790s literature”? Finally, having surveyed my six databases with the help of Smith, I discuss the multiple “Smiths” which emerge, and what it means to attempt to unify her disparate works.</Text>

The Digital Archive and Print Politics, 1789–99

My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like--in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers-- and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested in print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.
My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will establish, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are developing anti-oppressive and less “extractive” digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own research. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this eleven-year “decade” to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s will highlight the decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women writers. Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth-century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant  literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth-century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history began to be interpreted into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.
Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring  it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions in situations where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.
Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. I will examine individual works and individual authors,  Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as "popular literature”.
Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.
Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical--or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream”--printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a set of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, in context with the print production which they are alternatives to. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me with two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices with the horizon of expectations within the radical circles I expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.
A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work  suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a Gothic parody from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary productions are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.</Text>

            <Text>“It may be that Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads affiliates his own verse with the oral tradition of popular ballads that might seem the best recourse for a poet dedicated to the ‘principle of equality’, but it would be hard to claim that Wordsworth’s poems show a knowledge of that tradition equal to Walter Scott’s, nor that they were so deeply influenced by it, nor that they succeeded in addressing so wide an audience, and no one would claim either that Scott’s Muse was a levelling one, or that Scott developed a poetic style, whatever the claims Lukacs has made for the novels, that expressed the principles of the French Revolution.” (16) 

“The first period is characterized by the attempt to frame a universal language, a language in which it might be possible to address all of humanity. The most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status was the language of science, and hence it is appropriate that the most celebrated poet of these years, Erasmus Darwin, was concerned ‘to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science’. (16)

“Erasmus Darwin was the most popular poet of the 1790s, and his The Botanic Garden (1791), in which The Economy of Vegetation formed the first part, and The Loves of Plants (1789) the second, was the decade’s most popular poem.” (29) “The beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden published by Joseph Johnson in 1791, with its elegant typefaces, and its engravings from Fuseli and others, in itself proclaims a confidence in the book’s unusual importance. … His edition of Darwin’s poem registers his recognition of the book’s commercial prospects but also his recognition that the poem gave vivid expression to a set of / beliefs shared by Johnson’s stable of authors, and his confidence that in 1791 such beliefs could be expressed triumphally, by the publication of a volume as costly and elegant as one of Wedgwood’s copies of the Portland Vase, itself reproduced by Blake in the book’s most elaborate engraving.” (29-30)

“Throughout the period treated in this book successive governments made a more sustained and vigorous attempt to prevent the publication of Paine’s writings than those of any other radical propagandist, and the reason is obvious enough. They correctly detected in Tom Paine’s prose the achievement of the alliance between intellectual and popular radicalism that they most feared. Their campaign was strikingly unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent Paine’s works becoming more widely available through cheap reprints than the works of any other contemporary writer, and yet the consequence they feared never came to pass.” (59)
“But it would be idle to deny that it remains for all that an entirely eccentric text. Up to a point Blake’s printing methods in themselves account for this. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell exists in nine complete and two incomplete copies, and it seems improbable that very many more copies were ever produced. The contrast with the thousands of copies circulating of Paine’s Rights of Man needs no underlining. But it would be idle to pretend that the Marriage, even if Blake had devised a way of printing that made possible a wide circulation, would ever have achieved wide popularity, and this was not because Blake as an eccentric, but because his project was.” (60) “in making such an attempt Blake is likely to succeed only in writing the manifesto of a party of which he is the only member” (60)

“Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means — the original two volumes of the Minstrelsy sold for a guinea. James Ballantyne’s printing of the volumes works in tandem with Scott’s editorial work to secure this effect. Typefaces elegantly distinguish the ballads from their editorial matter, and the ballads themselves are displayed with an opulent disregard for economy, no more than eighteen lines to the page, so that the 134 lines of ‘Johnnie Armstrong’ occupy eight pages of the first volume.” (94)</Text>

            <Text>“Of course, “ction” is a rather broad genre; literary scholars are more commonly interested in the history of subgenres like Gothic or detective ction. Chapter  zooms in on those concepts in order to explain how new methods can support a perspectival approach to genre. e Aristotelian conception of genres as natu-ral literary kinds has given way over the last fty years to a warier approach that treats genres as historically contingent institutions.” (xiii) 

“In some cases, genres dened by observers in dierent periods turn out to align better than their names might suggest. A model trained on nineteenth- century “scientic romance” nds it easy to recognize contemporary “science ction” as a version of the same thing. In other cases, dierent perspectives turn out to be incompatible: the various traditions readers have called “Gothic,” for instance, aren’t well recognized by a single model.” (xv)

“Although debates about genre are as old as literary criticism itself, the term is still only loosely dened. Part of the reason is that genres look like dierent things at dierent points in the life of a text. Scholars of rhetoric, interested in the creation of works, tend to interpret genres as communicative actions. Sociologists often em-phasize communities of readers. Literary scholars, for their part, are preoccupied with the patterning of the texts themselves. Of course, all of these aspects of genre are connected. But it doesn’t follow that the histories of production, reception, and form are precisely the same. Does the persistence of science ction fandom, for instance, imply that a single textual pattern has united works of science c-tion themselves, from the pulp era to the present? Many scholars are skeptical. Some argue that “there is no such thing as science ction” in the texts themselves: the history of a genre is only the history of a community of readers, who may use the term “science ction” to describe radically dierent things in dierent decades.” (34)

“In this chapter, predictive models will become not quite a time machine but something almost as useful: a memory- wiping flashbulb that allows us to strategically erase our knowledge of the future or past as needed. e computer knows nothing about literary history: it models only the evidence we give it. is useful blindness will allow us to provisionally bracket twentieth- century science ction and to model Verne purely by contrasting him to his nineteenth- century contemporaries. en we can com-pare those models to models of the twentieth- century genre and see how closely their predictions align. In the pages that follow, I will call this method “perspectival modeling.” is chapter will often literally be modeling the perspectives of dierent groups of readers, but the phrase could also apply more broadly to any strategy that gets leverage on cultural history by comparing mod-els trained on dierent subsets of the evidence. e end of this chapter will assess the pace of change, for instance, by comparing models trained on dierent periods.” (35)
“We of-ten imagine numbers as an objective yardstick— something like sentence length or linguistic entropy that can become a xed reference point for the ux of history. A supervised model, by contrast, provides only a circular sort of evidence: it describes one set of texts through their relation to another.But then, circularity has long been recognized as the inherent condition of historical interpretation.” (36)
“When researchers try to step outside history to nd a xed met-ric like sentence length, they often end up creating a measure-ment whose signicance is hard to dene. Human signicance is created only by human history” (37)

“e models of genre created in this chapter will rely on tex-tual evidence. But that doesn’t force us to assume that genres are fundamentally textual patterns. As I began by noting, genres wear several dierent faces: they are practices of literary produc-tion, horizons of readerly expectation, and textual templates, all at once. If I had to choose one of those three faces as primary, I would lean toward emphasizing readers’ expectations. So this chapter will initially dene a “genre” as a group of books recog-nized by some specic, historically situated group of readers” … “Textual similarity will enter this chap-ter’s argument only because it turns out that texts can in fact be used to predict readers’ responses.” (38)

What Story Should We Expect to Find?

What Story Should We Expect to Find?
“Since literary scholars adhere to radically dierent theories of genre, we might expect several dierent outcomes for this in-quiry. If Mark Bould and Sherryl Vint are right that “there is no such thing” as genre in the text itself— only a contested set of expectations dened and redened by marketing— then we might expect textual models of genre simply to fail. If Franco Moretti is right that genre is a generational phenomenon, we might expect textual models to be stable only for twenty or thirty years. Science ction, in particular, seems likely to be mutable, since submarines and ray guns are constantly replaced by new wonders of tomorrow. It is not self- evident that the textual pat-terns in science ction would persist for more than a few decades.On the other hand, we might just as reasonably expect to nd a dierent pattern. With genre- specic pulp magazines (like Amazing Stories) and imprints (like Harlequin), twentieth- century genres achieved an institutional solidity that had rarely / been seen before. Histories of genre often emphasize the gradual consolidation of genre conventions in the rst half of the twen-tieth century. Scholars of the detective story point to Ronald Knox’s so- called Decalogue () of rules for writers as a crys-tallizing moment. For other genres the process of consolidation is thought to have taken even longer. Gary K. Wolfe suggests that “the science ction novel persistently failed to cohere as a genre” until Pocket Books gave it institutional form in the s. If this account of literary history is correct, we might expect to nd not a succession of generational phases but a steady hardening of boundaries, producing genres that are much more clearly distinct by the middle of the twentieth century than at its outset. Frankly, this is what I expected to nd when I began the project.” (38-9)
"e story that actually emerged from this experiment didn’t line up very neatly with either of the patterns we might have expected to nd: generational succession or gradual consolida-tion. I see little evidence of the generational waves that Moretti’s theory would predict. In fact, it isn’t even true that books in a chronologically focused genre (like “the sensation novel, 1860– 1880”) necessarily resemble each other more closely than books spread out across a long timeline. … But I also haven’t found much evidence for the story of gradual consolidation that I expected to nd. Although it is clearly true that the publishing institutions governing genre developed grad-ually, it appears I was wrong to expect that the textual dierences between genres would develop in the same gradual way.” (40)
“textual patterns don’t have to develop as gradually as institutions do. … Instead of being more volatile than communities of reception, textual patterns turn out to be, if anything, more durable.” (40)

“ I have gathered lists of titles as-signed to a genre in eighteen dierent sites of reception. Some of these lists reect recent scholarly opinion; some were shaped by nineteenth- century reviewers; others reect the practices of many dierent library catalogers over a long period of time. Al-though each list denes its object slightly dierently, they can be loosely arranged around three master categories whose coher-ence I propose to test: detective ction (or “mystery” or “crime” or “Newgate” ction), science ction (also dened in a variety of ways), and the Gothic. (It is debatable whether the Gothic, writ large, is a genre at all— but that’s what makes it an interesting case.)” (39)

“ it increasingly seems that a genre is not a single ob-ject we can observe and describe. It may instead be a mutable set of relations between works that are linked in dierent ways and resemble each other to dierent degrees. A problem like this requires a methodology that is cautious about ontological as-sumptions and patient with details. Predictive modeling ts the bill.” (41)
“e point of machine learning in proj-ects like these is not primarily to enlarge the number of books we consider but to register and compare blurry family resemblances that might be dicult to dene verbally without reductiveness. We can dispense with xed denitions and base the study of genre only on the practices of historically situated actors— but still produce models of genre substantive enough to compare and contrast. Here, and in many similar cases, computation can help scholars acknowledge the complexity of culture without collapsing the conversation into an empty consensus that all cultural phenomena are more or less slippery and elusive. Which genres turn out to be especially mutable or relatively stable?” (42) - discussing Hoyt Long and Richard Jean So on haiku
“Since no causal power is ascribed to variables in a predictive model, the particular features we use to model genres are not all- important.” (42)
“Moreover, if all the models in this chapter could be improved by 1%, it would make no dierence to the argument. What mat-ter are the relative strengths of the boundaries between dierent groups of texts. Which generic groupings are easier or harder to detect? Making our models as accurate as possible is worth doing only because it’s a reassuring sign that we haven’t left evidence on the table that would have changed those rankings.” (43)

“ predictive models are rather like human beings: they can always nd some ways two sets of works are similar and other ways they dier. If we want to know whether detective c-tion and science ction can be lumped together, no single model will answer the question. Instead, we need to pose a four- sided question that allows us to ask whether the dierences dening one genre are parallel to the dierences that dene another. Do detective stories dier from other works of ction in the same way that science ction diers?” (46)
“To answer this question, one can train a model on the contrast between detective ction and a randomly selected background and then ask the same model to distinguish works of science ction from the same background. As we might expect, this model fails utterly: it’s right less than half of the time. Although these two genres have a few things in common (theories and laboratories, for instance), their common elements seem not to be the features that most saliently dene / them.” (46-7)

“It is of course possible that a single exhibition catalog of detec-tive fiction (limited to volumes before 1941) will create a picture of the genre that diverges substantially from postwar volumes cataloged by many different hands. But that’s exactly the kind of question statistical models allow us to test. Modeling just the eighty- eight volumes from the Indiana exhibition that I was able to obtain digitally, we have a rather high level of accuracy, 93.2%. The 194 volumes that have Library of Congress genre tags are more of a mixed bag and can only be recognized 91.0% of the time. If we combine both sets, we have 266 volumes (since 16 were in both groups) that can be recognized with 93.4% accuracy. So mixing groups selected in different ways doesn’t reduce ac-curacy; it’s a compromise that “levels upward.”” (48)
“But as I have mentioned, algorithmic models can be very good at nding common elements that link a group of works. A bet-ter way of comparing two human denitions of genre is to train a model on one reader’s judgments and then ask it to predict judgments made by a dierent reader. For instance, when we ask a model trained on the Library of Congress detective ction to distinguish the Indiana exhibition from a random background and vice versa, we still get 85% accuracy on average. at’s the real conrmation that we’re looking at largely congruent denitions of the detective story.”

“In short, the models created by machine learning are not mysterious black boxes: it is quite possible to crack them open and ask how they work. But they work so well, in part, because they are under no obligation to condense the world into a crisp definition. A model of a complex, overdetermined concept is likely to be just as overdetermined itself. Working with a light touch, a critic who has read a few detective stories can use pre-dictive features to tease out insights (the absence of children in these stories, for instance, is an interesting dog that didn’t bark). But it would be a mistake to imagine that a predictive model can quickly resolve arguments about the essential features of a genre. For that kind of condensing, prioritizing work, we still need critical debate.” (49)

“The model is very condent about most of the nineteenth-  and twentieth- century volumes categorized as detective ction. But it has diculty recognizing Newgate and sensation novels as members of the same set, even though it has been trained on a sample that includes them and has not been given any indication that they are dierent from other detective stories. By contrast, Edgar Allan Poe’s three short stories from the 1840s seem entirely consonant with later denitions of the genre. e patterns that link Sue Grafton to Arthur Conan Doyle extend backward all the way to Poe— but not much farther. In short, quantitative methods are not inherently biased to-ward continuity or discontinuity. When cultural forms do change suddenly, a predictive model can recognize the break without being specically instructed to do so. ” (52)
“A model of 287 volumes puts us in a position to confirm that the similarities between works of detective ction are really becoming looser, overall, in the 1990s than they were in the 1920s or 1930s.” (52)

THE GOTHIC
“e history of Gothic ction creates, appropriately, a mystery about ancestral gures that haunt their descendants only as am-biguous traces. Critics seem fairly confident that the Gothic novel was a coherent phenomenon in Britain from 1760 to perhaps 1830. But as we move further into the nineteenth century, it becomes less and less clear whether the Gothic remains a continuous tradition.” (53)

Not sure about these methods: “Since we have good reasons to wonder whether “the Gothic” writ large is a strongly unied tradition, it was particularly im-portant in this case to compare dierent sources of testimony. Before 1840 I relied heavily on the Stanford Literary Lab’s list of Gothic ction; after 1840 I relied on the Library of Congress genre tags associated with “horror” or the “ghost story.” But I also collected a set of works mentioned in e Gothic, a Blackwell guide edited by David Punter and Glennis Byron (2004), which traces a Gothic tradition all the way from Horace Walpole to Brett Easton Ellis, linked through a surprising range of inter-mediary gures that includes Emily Brontë, Henry James, and H. P. Lovecraft.”
More accurate with the smaller samples. “The growing shakiness of this Gothic edifice as samples grow larger betrays a weakness somewhere in its foundation. In modeling a homogenous group of works, accuracy ordinarily increases as one gathers more data. ” (54)
“Declining accuracy suggests that our different sources are describing heterogenous things. We can conrm this using the method of mutual recognition. A model trained on Romantic- era Gothic works recognizes ghost stories only weakly and vice versa (69.8%); ghost stories are even less similar to twentieth- century horror (67.8%). If one compares twentieth-century horror directly to the Romantic- era Gothic, there is hardly any textual similarity at all (51.0%). I don’t expect this pattern to surprise many readers. … Establishing that the Gothic falls apart is a test less of the Gothic than of our method. A method that didn’t recog-nize hard cases would be hard to trust about others!”
His explanation: “the genre’s reliance on several distinct thematic prem-ises: ghost stories, Romantic- era tales of incarceration and es-cape (often mixed with a courtship plot), and twentieth- century horror. Each of these things is easier to model on its own than in combination with the others. Detective fiction is not internally divided in quite the same way.” (55) Even though you can tell apart hardboiled detective fiction from cozy mysteries, they group together in larger contexts — they “are never easier to model on their own than in combination” (55).

“It is not safe to assume that all genres change at the same pace or that the existence of distinct subgenres will necessarily weaken a parent category. In the case of the Gothic, the forces of drift and division do work against coalescence. But even so, the term names a real phenomenon: a group of texts that can be recognized with 81% accuracy over a span of 240 years can hardly be called inchoate. Critics sometimes acknowledge the contrast with more tightly unified literary groups by calling the Gothic a mode rather than a genre. The term is fair enough, but like many terminological distinctions, it substitutes a crisp binary division for a more muddled reality.” (56)

P 57 - starts third example, sci fi, from the premise that it’s “not intuitively clear whether we should expect science ction to hold together over long timelines, like detective ction, or fall apart like the Gothic.” (57)
He says “I drew on several dierent sources for that period” and refers to them as “ all these bibliographic sources” but it seems to only be two bibliographies?? (57)
Sci fi, unlike detective fiction, doesn’t seem to change much on cohesion as a genre — "the early his-tory of this genre looks incoherent to our retrospective gaze for parochial, presentist reasons” (60)
“One could, admittedly, object that my list of nineteenth- century scientic romances comes mostly from twentieth- century histories of science ction. Perhaps this group of texts is only co-herent because it was selected, tacitly, to provide a set of precur-sors for a more strongly unied genre? is is a fair objection.” (60) His counter: “I haven’t found a bibliography or reading list that I could use as strictly contem-porary evidence for the boundaries of the genre.” (60) Also: “it is still signicant that the concept coheres on a textual level. ere is no way to construct the same kind of retrospective coherence for the Gothic.” (61)

He does find a lot of change around the 1940s
“what kind of change are we detecting? is doesn’t have to be a mysterious question; there are many ways to open the so- called black box of machine learning and nd answers. For instance, one way to locate change is to ask which later books are hard for models trained on an earlier period to recognize. Since models assign each book a probability of being science ction, we can simply compare the probabilities assigned by models trained on dierent periods. This produces a measure of historical parallax or, so to speak, of surprise.” (62)

This whole section tries to marry several scales of analysis, from macroanalysis to individual passages.


“The evidence gathered in this chapter challenges three existing theories of genre. Franco Moretti’s conjecture that genre is a gen-erational cycle is probably the least important of these targets: Moretti oered it as a reluctant speculation, and it has only been adopted by a few other scholars. In any case, I have found no evidence to support it. e premise that genre boundaries gradu-ally “consolidate” in the early twentieth century is a more serious matter. e notion that the pulps gave form to protean traditions that had previously “failed to cohere” is very inuential in science ction criticism. But as we have seen above, the distinctive lan-guage of science ction seems to take form before the institutions that are supposed to have consolidated it. e third theory of genre I have questioned is the recently popular notion that his-tories of genre are merely a genealogical thread linking a ux of disparate cultural forms. Predictive models can directly challenge this claim. If a model trained on detective ction before 1914 can also recognize detective (and crime) ction after that date, then then the dierences separating the genre from the rest of the literary eld must have remained relatively stable.” (65)
“The historical picture that emerges from this inquiry is not simple. At first glance, there is a fairly clear contrast between long- lived twentieth- century genres (detective fiction and sci-ence fiction) and shorter- lived nineteenth- century phenomena (the Newgate novel or sensation fiction). But the rationale for this contrast is far from clear. Detective fiction and science fiction both seem to have stabilized before the modern marketing insti-tutions that are usually offered to explain their stability. For that matter, it is not clear why certain genres stabilize more than others. Gothic novels and science ction can both be traced back to the eighteenth century. It is not intuitively obvious why science ction should have turned out to be the less mutable member of that pair.” (66)
“even these tentative conclusions reveal that statistical models can challenge literary scholars’ assumptions about the history of genre. Moreover, I hope it is beginning to become clear that the limitations of a quantitative approach lie in a different place than popular notions about mathematics might suggest.” (66)
“any suggestion that numbers might illuminate human history immediately calls forth a well- rehearsed script, where math is expected to define objective patterns and humanists sigh that things are more com-plicated and depend on the observer’s assumptions.” (66)
“Numbers did nothing to make this inquiry less perspectival. But they did allow us to compare perspectives and describe differences of degree between them. Once various observers have provided examples of the Gothic, for instance, we can use mathematical models to ask how compatible their assumptions are or how rapidly the genre mutates as we move down a timeline. In short, the point of quantification can be to render description relative rather than objective. Perspectival models are deeply compatible with an anti foundational approach to interpretation.”(66)

“Modeling genre, in chapter , was a relatively easy task. Genres are expressed on the surface of a literary text. Some genre con-cepts are blurry, but many are easy to recognize.” (76)</Text>

            <Text>Abstract
The posthumously published Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson (1801) has been read as a final – but flawed – attempt to defend the conduct and rescue the reputation of the notorious actress, poet, and one-time royal mistress, Mary Darby Robinson (1758–1800). Narrating her life as a pathetic tale of transgression and suffering, the Memoirs seems destabilised by inconsistencies in structure and gaps in content which are often discussed by modern critics as shortcomings: evidence of self-censorship, ‘confused’ intentions, or an inability to fashion an acceptable feminine persona. However, these so-called shortcomings may comprise a nuanced strategy of self-presentation designed to evoke curiosity and sympathy. Robinson's Memoirs was reprinted throughout the nineteenth century, spurring numerous novels, mini-biographies, and periodical articles. By examining nineteenth-century responses to the Memoirs, this essay argues for Robinson's life writing as innovative and influential, and gestures to the benefits of extending the traditional ‘edges’ of Romanticism in terms of both genre and period.
Civale, S. (2018) Women’s life writing and reputation: a case study of Mary Darby Robinson. Romanticism, 24 (2). pp. 191-202. ISSN 1354-991X. 
“Robinson spent the bulk of her adult life transforming her public position from sex object to writing subject.” (1+191?)
“despite the continuing doubts about its reliability, Robinson’s Memoirs enjoyed a robust afterlife. It was reprinted ten times in the nineteenth century alone, spurring reviews, essays, spin-off novels, illustrations, poems, mini-biographies, entries in multibiographies, and citations in the life writing of other key figures, most notably that of King George IV himself. Long after her poetry and fiction had fallen out of print, Robinson’s Memoirs continued to interest, perplex, and charm readers.” (3+191?)
“The anonymous novel, The Royal Legend: A Tale (1808), one of several nineteenth-century fictionalisations of Robinson’s royal affair, shows how some of these opposing qualities were read and replayed.” (10+191?)
“Considerations of Robinson in non-fiction also exhibit traces of her Memoirs. In particular, many of the nineteenth-century biographical essays on Robinson relish the coexistence of the unfortunate victim of sensibility and the accomplished woman of the stage. Dutton Cook titles his 1865 mini-biography of Robinson ‘Poor Perdita’, immediately calling to mind her status as a figure of pathos and misfortune.” (13+191?)
“A similar interest in analysing Robinson’s psychology and dramatizing her life also emerges in Elizabeth Barrington’s The Exquisite Perdita, a story which was serialised, with illustrations, in Nash’s and Pall Mall Magazine 1925-26, and reissued in book form in London in 1926.” (15+191?)
“Still, the prevailing critical opinion is that Robinson’s Memoirs ultimately failed to restore her reputation. Cheryl Wanko maintains that Robinson ‘could only salvage [her character] so much’ and Laura Engel, that her ‘attempts to rescue her damaged reputation were thwarted’.37 These claims are true in the sense that Robinson could not erase her scandalous history or escape the public knowledge of her sexual transgression(s), in her lifetime or after. Nevertheless, the nineteenth-century texts considered in this essay indicate some of the ways that Robinson’s Memoirs influenced the texture of her afterlife. Perhaps a reputation is not something merely to be ‘damaged’ or ‘salvaged’, but something to be shaped. Women have long been appraised according to what Katharine Kittredge calls ‘the good woman/bad woman dichotomy’, and yet one of Robinson’s most troubling and appealing features is that she embodies both of these binaries.38 She tells us what she is not telling us, and she visually highlights what she conceals.” (18+191?)

            <Text>The book facsimiles which would become Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) began as in 1983, when the company Research Publications, Inc began to produce its Eighteenth Century Collection microfilm. Research Publications was a newly-founded for-profit company, which was founded in 1981. They and their rival, University Microfilms, produced many of the facsimile images in contemporary databases. Today, the former Research Publications, Inc is part of Gale Cengage, and University Microfilms is part of ProQuest; as ECCO’s history continues, the private company that owns the microfilms will change many times.

            <Title>three Gothic histories</Title>
            <Text>Indeed, the many histories of Gothic studies as a field generally consist of competing claims as to which is the first serious study. This is often taken to be David Punter’s 1996 The Literature of Terror, written more than a decade after queer and feminist examinations of early gothic works, such as Eve Sedgwick and George Haggerty’s studies of Horace Walpole, William Beckford, and Matthew Lewis in 1985 and 1986. 

Gothic criticism has required several different strategies to revalue disreputable literature. (Queer studies, feminist studies, psychoanalytical)
There are three histories of three sorts of Gothic studies: queer Gothic studies, feminist Gothic studies, and ‘serious’ Gothic studies. Those who work on the queer gothic identify, as the catalyst for a reconsideration of the Gothic itself, Eve Sedgwick’s 1985 monograph, Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire. Sedgwick often goes hand-in-hand with George Haggerty’s 1986 article “Literature and Homosexuality in the Late Eighteenth Century: Walpole, Beckford, and Lewis,” which examined the same authors. But those who examine the Female Gothic, employing feminist rather than queer critique, see earlier origins for the field in Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s Madwoman in the Attic (1979) and Juliann Fleenor’s The Female Gothic (1983). And many discussions of the Gothic-qua-Gothic skip directly from Montague Summers’ 1938 The Gothic Quest to David Punter’s 1996 The Literature of Terror, more than a decade after Sedgwick. The Summers-to-Punter historiography is generally invested in a rhetorical move by which Summers’ work is dismissed as sloppy, unscholarly, motivated by mere enthusiasm (though usefully obsessive), such that Punter emerges in contrast as the first examination of the Gothic to be serious. Of course, implicit in this rhetorical move is the idea that feminist and queer scholarship on the Gothic is also unserious, perhaps contaminated by personal enthusiasm.</Text>

            <Text>

“HathiTrust, as a co-managed and co-funded collaborative of academic and research libraries, relies on its members to govern its programmatic, financial, and strategic directions. Membership established the governance model in 2012 and comprises the following entities: 
The Board of Governors
The Program Steering Committee
The governing bodies operate under the HathiTrust Bylaws. In addition to the formal governing bodies, multiple working, advisory, and task-based groups further enable member libraries to participate in and guide the direction of HathiTrust. As necessary, members vote on various policies or changes using the weighted voting system established in 2011.” (HathiTrust, “Governance”)

“The budget of HathiTrust is a separately maintained budget held within the University of Michigan budget system and managed by the Executive Director with oversight from the Executive Committee. Some additional financial components of the operation are represented by commitments in kind by participating members. The University Library’s financial procedures are subject to audits by the University of Michigan Office of University Audits.” (HathiTrust, “Governance”)

Wikipedia: “The partnership includes over 60 research libraries[7] across the United States, Canada, and Europe, and is based on a shared governance structure. Costs are shared by the participating libraries and library consortia.[8] The repository is administered by the University of Michigan.[9] The Executive Director of HathiTrust is Mike Furlough.[10] The HathiTrust Shared Print Program is a distributed collective collection whose participating libraries have committed to retaining almost 18 million monograph volumes for 25 years, representing three-quarters of HathiTrust digital book holdings.[11]”</Text>

Today, “The English Short-Title Catalogue is the most comprehensive record of what has appeared in print in Britain and the English-speaking world for all branches of human experience from the last quarter of the fifteenth century to the start of the nineteenth.

            <Text>Although each individual database has attracted some discussion, they have not been discussed together as an interlocking system. Instead, each database (or cluster of related databases) attracts discussion within its own conventional sphere. Here, I will discuss them together, organized chronologically by decade. A chronological organization makes it clear how many different organizations are in fact responding to shared historical conditions, or even to each others’ development, as they make strategic decisions over time. A chronological organization also contrasts with essentially teleological descriptions of individual resources, which tend to work backward from a current state to present a clean narrative of how that current state was discovered to be ideal. By refusing to gloss over dead ends, periods of stagnation, and other oddities, we can better understand the current state of contemporary databases as the outcome of historically contingent processes which might have turned out differently, rather than accepting them uncuriously as inevitabilities.</Text>

	5.	(Book history) Cronin: mostly asserts that people are “popular” or “celebrated”; with Erasmus Darwin, supports this by saying that the book The Botanic Garden is beautiful &amp; expensive
	6.	(Editions, reprints, market share, profitability) Lesser &amp; Farmer, Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade - “we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain)” (Behrendt 201).

            <Title>Sedgwick</Title>
            <Text>Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: “The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one’s findings: “What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.” The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. </Text>

Because it's digital, we expect accessibility/convenience, but often what digitality actually enables is a black box. The goal of my work, which is still extremely preliminary, is to take a small enough slice of "big data" that I can actually examine it carefully, and to scrutinize it.

My work as a digital humanities scholar right now 


data collection
even though "MARC" stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue," at points I read these records with my feeble human eyes

titles per year
- this was unreasonably difficult to make; OpenRefine was the secret
- TCP is the most unbalanced -- though that may be because it also includes Evans texts

publisher location
ESTC shows more published in Edinburgh than in Scotland
(210 Edinburgh, 52 Scotland)
Neither of these includes Ireland right now -- ESTC because it's not in my query, ECCO because I deleted Ireland to match ESTC

ECCO stats are based on the 37,830 MARC records which include publisher location
Somewhat inexplicably, 27,140 MARC records don't include bibliographical publisher assessment, just a transcription of the title page
(I also have 25,000 more MARC records than I expected so I have some more correlating to do.)

The ancien re ́gime and its critics 
was partly because the event resembled less a domestic rebellion than an invasion by a foreign prince, and crucially because of the need to placate the Tories who were inured to the doctrine of ‘passive obedience and non- resistance’ and to abhorrence of the ‘king-killing doctrines’ they associated with puritans and Jesuits. The need to assuage the troubled consciences of conservatives ensured that the Allegiance Controversy became chiefly an exercise in casuistry: the resolving of conscientious scruples by the applica- tion of general moral principles to equivocal practical contingencies. The matter was made pressing by the imposition of a new oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary, demanded of those who had previously solemnly sworn fealty to James II. Once again, an earlier debate was invoked, that surrounding the Engagement Controversy of 1649, when people had been required to swear allegiance to the English republic in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I. Anthony Ascham’s Of the Confusions and Rev- olutions of Government (1649) was republished, advising stoical acquiescence to power and the dispositions of divine providence.

            <Text>“e rst chapter suggests that many well- known changes in eighteenth- , nineteenth- , and twentieth- century ction can be understood as parts of a single dierentiating process that de-ned the subject, style, and pace of ction through opposition to nonction.” (xiii)

“one of the central arguments of this book is that contemporary quantitative methods can be very good at repre-senting perspectival problems and can give us leverage on that dimension of history.Questions of perspective may be the last place we would ex-pect to encounter math. In the twentieth century, numbers were used mostly for physical measurements (or demographic counts) that didn’t vary greatly from one observer to another. ose as-sociations have given many people the impression that Arabic numbers are somehow in themselves objective or aspire to be independent of social context. But if we look with fresh eyes at contemporary quantitative methods, we may notice that they are not distinguished by any aspiration to objectivity. Machine learn-ing, in particular, is causing public scandal because it tends to be all too sensitive to subjective contexts” (xiv)

“When scholars explicitly dene a concept, we can craft a def-inition that aspires to neutrality. But the models produced by machine learning don’t rely on explicit denitions; instead, they learn concepts entirely from illustrative examples. Learning from examples makes machine learning exible but also very apt to pick up the assumptions or prejudices latent in a particular selec-/ tion of evidence. is has become a huge problem for institutions that are expected to be neutral arbiters. … When we’re reasoning about the past, on the other hand, our aim is usually to acknowledge and ex-plore biases, not to eace them. Understanding the subjective preferences implicit in a particular selection of literary works, for instance, may be exactly the goal of our research. For this kind of project, it is not a problem but a positive advantage that machine learning tends to absorb assumptions latent in the evidence it is trained on. By training models on evidence selected by dierent people, we can crystallize dierent social perspectives and com-pare them rigorously to each other.is approach, which I call “perspectival modeling,” has taken shape only in the last few years. Readers who are familiar with other ways of using machine learning may need to set some as-sumptions aside. e models created in this book are supervised: that is, they always start from evidence labeled by human readers. But unlike supervised models that try to divine the real author of an anonymous text, perspectival models do not aim simply to reproduce human judgment. ey are used instead to measure the parallax between dierent observers” (xv)

“it is worth teasing out the assumptions implied by these succession stories— which are not dominant, after all, in every corner of the university. Many disciplines tell their own stories instead as a cumulative process of expansion. … Literary scholars, by contrast, commonly do assume that critical approaches are locked in dialectical struggle. And this assumption is not arbitrary: the premise has been correct for much of our history. Critical debates amount to struggles over a scarce resource— readerly attention.” (Underwood 1)
“our enterprise seems to draw meaning from the pressure of limited attention: recovery projects become notable and important (rather than merely additive) when they argue that new discoveries force us to redene an established concept like Romanticism” (2)
“Implicit in this self- understanding is an assumption that the broad divisions of literary debate are already known: that we are unlikely to discover, for instance, a new genre or period in the archives.” (2)

“Although Moretti ges-tures at a mass of unread works, literary scholars have been reluc-tant to believe that this really creates a new object of knowledge, seeing instead a familiar dialectical move that plants a new ag on terrain of recognized signicance (say, detective ction) by claim-ing to displace a critical approach called close reading.” (2)
“Do we actually understand the broad outlines of literary history? I think we understand them well at a generational scale, and haz-ily at the level of a single century. But as we back up farther, the limits of our knowledge become evident: large patterns emerge for which we don’t yet have names.” (3)
“Instead of staging normative argu-ments about the right approach to a limited number of familiar topics, we need to explore ways of coordinating dierent scales of analysis” (3)

1. The Horizon of Literary Knowledge

Close-reading two passages
“Fielding was certainly a teller, and Allen’s tactic of expressing human feeling through colors and wind- rued hair qualies as an extreme form of showing. So these passages t the alleged historical pattern.But frankly, I chose both passages for that reason. How con-dent are we that the rest of literary history between 1749 and 1913 can be organized around a transition from telling to showing?” (7)
“Historians who think highly of modernism, or of Henry James, are more likely to believe in a broad shift from “telling” toward “showing” than historians who think highly of postmodernism or George Eliot. Scholars do agree about some simple long- term trends: the decline of rhymed poetry, for in-stance. … But in contexts where we need consensus (like a classroom anthology), historical generalizations are typically limited to periods.” (8)
“Nor is this limitation necessarily perceived as a problem. Since our disciplinary institutions are also built around periods, literary scholars specializing in dierent centuries are rarely forced to reach agreement about long- term patterns. Disagreements be-tween historical elds often present themselves as normal, even inevitable temperamental dierences between people who have chosen to study dierent things. So we let the argument drop and move on to something else. It’s not obvious that these debates could ever be resolved simply by discussing a larger number of books.” (8)

2. Measurement

“references to color are about three times more common, on average, in early- twentieth- century ction than they had been in the eighteenth century.” (9)
”A second obvious form of skepticism involves questions about the particular sample of works discussed in gure .. Questions of this kind can be important. In fact, as we’ll see in chapter , a great deal can be learned by paying attention to the subtle dierences between literary texts sampled in dierent ways— drawn from reviews in prestigious journals, say, or from the ob-scure reaches of an academic library. But it is also important to grasp that the subtle differences between samples rarely make a century- spanning trend disappear.” (10)

“Here, the prominence of Franco Moretti’s speculative rationale for distant reading may have created misleading expectations. Moretti hypothesized that the “slaughterhouse” of forgot-ten works might contain a history very different from the one preserved in academic canons. Some readers naturally replied that canonical works “for better or worse… have achieved a position of cultural centrality” and ought to have more weight in our histories. Because the topic of canonicity is charged with passion left over from twentieth- century cultural warfare, this debate caught fire before either side had carefully weighed the difference it made. Across long timelines, it turns out not to make much. On many axes of measurement, prominent and obscure writers are traveling together in the same direction, albeit at slightly (and interestingly) different speeds. The trends we per-ceive in the slaughterhouse are usually also visible in the canon. While it is worth exploring the differences between samples, we don’t have to reach consensus on a correctly balanced list of works before beginning to map long- term trends. (And that is of course fortunate, since there may be no single correctly balanced list.)” (11)

“Correlation doesn’t prove causation, as we have all learned to say, but the tests that do prove causation (like controlled experiments) are hard to apply to the historical record. Moreover, our understanding of history is of-ten so sketchy that things far short of a causal explanation can improve it substantially.” (12)

Inscreasing physical descriptions, possibly as a metric of showing v telling
“One can see that the trend they traced in the nineteenth century continues straight through the twenti-eth. On the other hand, it doesn’t extrapolate indenitely into the past; as we move back into the early eighteenth century, the trend reverses and diction starts to become more concrete. Most interesting of all, this was not a broad transformation of the En-glish language aecting all genres to the same degree. Instead, emphasis on physical description creates a gap between ction and nonction— a dierence that has steadily increased over the course of the last two centuries.” (14)
“If I had said, “Frances Allen’s insistence on physical description dramatizes a transformation of ction that continued steadily from 1780 to 2000 and places her well ahead of the curve for 1923,” readers would rightly have laughed at my arbitrary assertion. at isn’t necessarily a coun-terintuitive story: it may, in retrospect, be a plausible one. But the fact that something is retrospectively plausible doesn’t mean we already knew it.” (14)
“Even more puzzling: Why should urbanization have exerted such radically dierent eects on ctional and nonctional narratives from 1780 forward? We might reply that novelists had to describe the experienced texture of life, while biographers could continue to rely on broad sum-mary. But the novel’s growing insistence on experienced detail is the phenomenon we’re trying to explain. We can’t take it for granted in our explanation.” (15)

“it becomes dicult to get interpre-tive leverage on a trend defined purely through lists of words.” (15)
“I’m not suggesting that the lists of words in the General In-quirer are somehow better than those developed at Stanford. My point is rather that all semantic categories are imperfect, and no list of categories (however exible) will provide a secure foun-dation for literary- historical inquiry. We can list the names of colors, and perhaps action verbs, but there will always be concepts like “temporal immediacy” that escape our preconceived catego-ries. at isn’t to say that semantic categories must be entirely abandoned. In fact, I will circle back to the General Inquirer later in this chapter and use it casually to abbreviate description of a few patterns. But the word casually, in that last sentence, ex-presses a deliberate restraint. I have been careful throughout this book not to put much evidentiary weight on lists of words. While mixed semantic categories may be useful as loose abbreviations, we cannot trust them to describe cultural phenomena precisely. For trustworthy description, we need some kind of evidence more deeply rooted in historical context.” (16)

3. Modeling

“scholars often nd themselves similarly squinting at networks of characters or authors, wondering what the shape of the network implies. e fundamental source of this problem is that research-ers have begun by tracing phenomena that don’t yet have literary // signicance for a community of readers. Although I know what colors are, for instance, I don’t really know what the frequent oc-currence of color terms in a novel would tell me about the story. “e chromatic novel” is not a genre anyone recognizes. An un-familiar starting point can be fruitful, in the sense that it reveals large patterns scholars don’t yet understand. But it doesn’t help us interpret the patterns we discover. Revealing a new trend without connecting it to existing scholarly debate invites the question, “So what?” Researchers with a more quantitative background might characterize the problem as “data dredging”: in sorting through a vast heap of evidence for something interesting, we run a risk of cherry- picking.
Both problems can be addressed in the same way: we need to reverse the sequence of steps in our inquiry. Instead of measuring things, nding patterns, and then nally asking what they mean, we need to start with an interpretive hypothesis (a “meaning” to investigate) and invent a way to test it.” (Underwood 16-17)

“But if the divergence of genres in gure 1.2 is puzzling and seems at odds with some existing accounts of literary history, why not take it as a hypothesis to test? at approach has the enormous advantage of beginning from a familiar starting point. Fiction and biography are not crisp, stable, or objective concepts; they are much less stable, in fact, than our concept of color. But unlike the “chromatic novel,” ction and biography are concepts that have long circulated through interpretive communities. To tell a meaningful story about the human past, we don’t need stable objectivity. We need the foundation provided by recogniz-able social points of reference.” (Underwood 18)
”In eect, we are reversing the process that created gure 1.2: instead of starting with a list of signicant words and asking how two genres fare against that standard, we are starting from the genres, looking for textual dierences that distinguish them, and then evaluating the strength of the dierences.” (Underwood 19)

“Since we want to distinguish fiction from nonfiction using only evidence contained in the text, this task will probably need to be delegated to an algorithm. Human readers would find it hard to forget their previous knowledge that Samuel Johnson had a real existence and Robinson Crusoe only a feigned one.” (Underwood 19)
“Up to this point in the chapter, computers have been dispensable conveniences. With a few days of hard work, we could have counted words by hand. But now we need some-thing more complex” (19)

Trying to assess “the probability that librarians will label a given volume “ction.”” (19)
“the imprecision of the human world is part of the reason why numbers are so useful in social science: they allow researchers to describe continua instead of sorting everything into discrete categories. Our model of genre will similarly be continuous. We will have to train it on a sample of volumes that librarians have sorted into two discrete groups (ction and biography) because the human beings who wander through libraries tend to prefer a space organized by clear bound-aries. But the model itself doesn’t have to be discrete; it predicts the probability that a volume will be perceived as ction.” (Underwood 20)

“What linguistic features should the model use as clues? e choice is not actually crucial. …  a exible strategy, which has worked well for many similar questions, is simply to treat each dictionary entry (and type of punctuation) as a variable.” (Underwood 20)
This is where he explains TF/IDF
“Readers unfamiliar with this method are often disconcerted by the seeming naïveté of representing literary works simply through word frequency. It would be easy to add complexity to soothe skeptics. Ad hoc syntactic variables might make the model seem more likely to capture the loosely dened concept we gesture at with the word style. But candidly, this would be no more than a magician’s pu of smoke, which impresses viewers by distracting them from the actual mechanics of the trick. In reality, models based on word frequency predict human read-ers’ judgments as well as more complex strategies. This doesn’t mean that the differences between texts are, at bottom, all differ-ences of diction. e fundamental dierence between biography and ction probably has something to do with our concept of reality (hard as that may be to dene). But a learning algorithm doesn’t attempt to dene the fundamental dierence between two genres; it aims simply to distinguish examples. And in practice, the thematic and formal differences between genres do leave legible traces at the level of word choice. Deferring denition is a philosophically interesting aspect of machine learning, discussed at more length in appendix B. For now, suce it to say that lit-erary historians may appreciate the exibility of this approach, since literary genres rarely have clear and stable denitions.” (Underwood 21)

He uses logical regression, lightly “modernized” with regularization to avoid overfitting (22)

“A statistical model’s inference about probability is admittedly an odd thing to discuss. It is much less tangible than “the fre-quency of color terms,” where we began. In fact, I feel condent that this book will be criticized for talking about models: many readers would nd distant reading more accessible if it conned itself to linguistic measurements like sentence length or word fre-quency. Instead of directly measuring the text, predictive models describe a relationship between social and textual evidence. is inevitably requires some mental gymnastics, but in the long run I think this relational approach grounds interpretation more per-suasively in human history. Figure 1.1, measuring the frequency of color terms, was simple and vivid— but it was hard to say exactly what it meant. By contrast, gures 1.3 and 1.4 have clear histori-cal signicance, because we started by looking for a dierence between two genres that human readers already recognize. More-over, this strategy will provide an important kind of perspectival exibility in later chapters. is chapter has taken the dierence between ction and biography as a constant. (I have trusted li-brarians to dene the genres.) But if we chose, we could train dif-ferent models to capture dierent readers’ understanding of this generic boundary. When we discuss boundaries even slipperier than ction/nonction, that exibility will become indispensable.” (Underwood 24)

Findings: “ the models tend to become more confident in their judgment as time passes. Early volumes are often fairly ambiguous, hovering close to the central dividing line. (Tom Jones, in fact, is exactly on the line.) But twentieth- century books tend to be more clearly marked as either fiction or biography” (Underwood 24)
“The words that matter in figures 1.3 and 1.4 are, simply, whatever words worked best to distinguish fiction from biography in a given period; they were chosen by a regression algorithm that was struggling to separate these two groups of texts.” (24)
The words that turned out to matter were the concrete ones.
“To put this another way: the direction fiction moved from 1750 to 1950 can be concisely described as “away from biography.” It begins to look like the novel steadily specialized in something that biography (and other forms of nonfiction) could rarely provide: descriptions of bodies, physical actions, and immediate sensory perceptions in a precisely specified place and time.” (26)

“I have been describing trends, not motives or market forces. So I can’t prove that novelists moved toward sensory and tempo-ral immediacy because it was a niche not yet lled by nonction. When I say that ction and nonction “dierentiated” from each // other, I am loosely guided by Émile Durkheim’s theory that so-cial institutions tend to subdivide and specialize. But his theory doesn’t provide a detailed account of causes or motives. e mo-tives of writers and readers, across three centuries, will no doubt be varied and tangled” (28-9)

4. Coordinating Dierent Scales of Analysis

“I began by posing a question about our percep-tion that the literary past had been broadly mapped, exactly to make that illusion of comprehension disappear. Leaving loose ends was always the point of the exercise. … This chapter may not answer every question it raised, but it ought to try to bring back some of the comprehension that vanished as we zoomed out to an unfamiliar scale. In shifting from simple measurement to models of genre, I was already struggling to re-store comprehension, by reattaching large, cloudy lexical trends to recognizable literary reference points. Another way to bring back comprehension is to acknowledge that, in a sense, we did already understand every individual segment of the trend we are discussing.” (30)
“scholars already have some explanation for every part of the widening gap between fiction and biography. It would be odd if they didn’t. thousands of human beings have spent a great deal of time studying literary history, and we understand that history, locally, very well. But local understanding doesn’t necessarily tell us how all the pieces fit together to form a big picture.” (31)

“The juxtaposition of local knowledge with global ignorance / can be irritating, and our minds move rapidly to erase any dissonance between the two. When large patterns finally emerge, they are necessarily compatible with pieces of the puzzle we have already seen at close range. So an observer inevitably feels “I recog-nize that! I knew Tom Jones was akin to biography!” From there, it is a short step to the conclusion that the global pattern was also lurking at the back of my mind or was nothing more than I expected all along. But this is often self- deception. Psychologists call it “hindsight bias.” I started by contrasting Henry Fielding to Frances Allen partly in order to remind readers how literary scholars have usually framed arguments about long timelines in the past. Typically, these arguments have been vague, controversial assertions: for instance, fans of modernism will advance a thesis about a shift from telling to showing, which immediately annoys fans of the Victorian novel. The challenge is to find a perspective that makes the descriptions preferred by eighteenth- , nineteenth- , and twentieth- century scholars all congruent with each other.” (31-32)

“The temptation to see macroscopic discoveries as less than genuinely new is particularly strong for literary scholars because we are trained to find disciplinary significance only in claims that directly reverse existing expectations. When we are writing about individual books, this is a reasonable goal. A single book is easy to summarize. So if I plan to write about a novel you al-ready read, I need to directly reverse some of your expectations in order to tell you anything new. But when we are surveying three centuries of literary history, descriptive summary is barely possible. Privileging counterintuitive claims here would be as absurd as privileging counterintuitive arguments about climate change. The truth is that we barely have intuitions about patterns on this scale; our expectations are not clearly formed yet, and it would be just as important to confirm them as to confute them.” (32)

We usually string together literary history by framing each thing as rejecting the previous. “Scholars know this narrative of conflict and displacement is a rhetorical crutch, and we frequently apologize for it when sharing a drink with colleagues who work on earlier periods. But we also keep making the gesture because we don’t have many better ways to link a long series of roughly generation-sized studies and turn them into a connected narrative.” (33)

“Quantitative methods give scholars a dierent way of connect-ing the dots— one that makes it easier to reveal gradual change across a long timeline. But this large picture doesn’t necessarily erase more familiar stories about generational struggle and dia-lectical reversal. ose conicts merely occupy a dierent scale of description. Literary history can be a series of erce battles between dierent aesthetic standards and also a single smooth current carrying the novel steadily away from the language, sub-ject matter, and formal strategies of nonction narrative. If we approach to examine that historical current more closely, the things that looked like eddies will turn out to be struggles be-tween aesthetic movements. Approaching even closer, we may see individual authors oating on the surface— for instance, here is one who lost her hearing and worked as a photographer. And here are two young people, facing each other in a small boat, sur-rounded by sun- ecked water. e wind has caught her hair and the ends of her black four- in- hand tie.” (33)</Text>

            <Text>Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to explore how works from this eleven-year “decade” have been selected as important, literary, or popular. For this period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? My experiments examine six major databases to answer these questions: The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. For each database, I download their holdings identified as printed in England 1789-1799. I identify how many titles the database attributes to each year. I calculate how many works are attributed to male, female, or unknown authors. These very simple pieces of information, when they differ widely between databases, provides the basis for an initial analysis of the assumptions and limitations of each database. I then examine the contents of each database more closely, to compare the inclusion of broad categories of writing like poetry, drama, prose fiction, and ephemera. Identifying these categories of writing within each corpus reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry in the smaller databases. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller databases. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by under-representing novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of selection. To ground my analysis in specifics, I take Charlotte Smith as a case study author. Smith has a long history of contentious reception, rooted in debates about seriousness, popularity, and women’s writing. I revisit them to see how her career and reception might be interpreted through a new lens. I do so, in part, to challenge the contrast drawn between ‘popular’ and ‘serious’ writing, especially in the historical evaluation of women’s writing as literary.</Text>
            <Comments>Google Books and Project Gutenberg are not, of course, traditionally “scholarly” resources, but that is why they form an informative contrast with the other resources examined.
This calculation is carried out by manually examining the metadata of the six corpora I have acquired.
This calculation is carried out by a small, simple program I am writing, described in Appendix A. Because the program just simplifies a straightforward process of counting, it is only lightly theorized in the dissertation itself. 
I already know that ‘titles per year’ are distributed fascinatingly differently between ECCO, ECCO-TCP, ESTC, and HathiTrust
This calculation is carried out by a larger, more complex program I am writing, applying topic modelling to the titles of works. Because it makes several major interpretive choices, it is theorized and discussed in detail when it is applied.
TK: “What would be your preliminary hypothesis? I guess one assumption might be that market-driven choices are made in light of existing demand i.e. the established teaching / research canon, in which case there would be an inherent conservatism in selection of texts.”</Comments>

            <Title>Duckling - literary fate</Title>
            <Text>Duckling, Louise. “‘Tell My Name to Distant Ages’: The Literary Fate of Charlotte Smith.” Charlotte Smith in British Romanticism, edited by Jacqueline Labbe. Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2008, pp. 203-217.

“During her lifetime Charlotte Smith was a literary celebrity: her Elegiac Sonnets and Other Poems (1784) were continuously reprinted and wifely emulated. She was a popular and prolific author, excelling in a series of novels, collections of verse and translations. Smith’s high volume of output, in a range of genres, reflects the deepening financial crisis that she was working to alleviate.” (203)

“Smith aspired to a place in posterity, but her contemporary success failed to secure her a place within the newly-emerging national canon. Whilst the absence of women poets from our literary histories has been a ubiquitous complaint, Smith was not entirely forgotten: her contribution was assessed in a variety of nineteenth-century anthologies, dictionaries and celebrations of ‘lost’ female talent. This essay will evaluate Charlotte Smith within these publications to reveal her colourful fate in posterity.” (203)

“Smith’s place in history is strongly influenced by the nature of her contemporary popularity, and in particular by her attractive public image.” (203) — attractive even though she was sometimes bitter and sarcastic in prefaces; her distress outweighed this and she still garnered sympathy (204)
Her marketing propaganda (herself as pitiable object of sympathy, rather than as master artist) became historical legacy. “This view would become deeply entrenched in the nineteenth century, when the cults of motherhood and the poetess were in ascendancy.” (204)

“Smith was excluded from Housman’s A Collection of English Sonnets (1835) on the grounds that her sonnets were ‘mawkish effusions’.” (205)

“Charlotte Smith’s popularity had helped to fuel a craze for sonnet writing, with her particular brand of sonnet being tirelessly imitated in the 1780s and 1790s. Smith’s reputation clearly suffered as a result of her association with this saturated, devalued, and feminized market.” (205)

“As Mary Poovey has argued, the ultimate effect of the revolutionary decade was to set women on their journey towards the ‘Victorian pedestal’, as increasingly idealized imaged of femininity took hold: female artists were expected to embody purity and goodness in their art and in their lives. Concurrently, women writers were being marginalized by what Gary Kelly has described as a ‘remasculinization’ of literature and culture.” (208) Smith stopped being anthologized as a poet, and entered anthologies as a poetess.
Brydges and Barbauld anthologize/praise Smith as an artist in a mixed-gender field 1808-1810 (though still in gendered terms). This shifts: Dyce (1825) and Rowton (1848) and Bethune (1848) and Adams (1857) anthologize in separate women-only collections, praising both her art and her life. Women anthologize her differently: Elwood (1843), Williams (1861), and Kavanagh (1862) see more literary importance.
“From a critical perspective, Charlotte Smith lost intellectual ground by the end of the nineteenth century, but women’s poetry was still a commercial venture and her poems frequently appeared in popular anthologies.” (216). But Robertson’s 1883 poetesses anthology dismisses the poetry as unpleasant to read, even though Smith was admirable.

More recent critical history:
“In the early twentieth century, critical accounts focused on Smith’s contributions to the novel. In 1913, Saintsbury believed Smith was ‘something of a person in herself, but less of a figure in history, because she neither innovates nor does old things consummately.’ Even the first extensive study of Smith by Florence Hilbish, whilst highlighting many areas of innovation, arrived at the conclusion that she produced ‘little strikingly original’ material … the twentieth century was not yet ready to truly appreciate Charlotte Smith. This is evident in Ernest Bernbaum’s / indifferent review of Hilbish’s work, which concluded that ‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable.’” (Duckling 216-7)
“The feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s generated a surge of interest in women’s writing, predominantly focused on the novel. Simultaneously, a revived interest in the historical context of literature enabled Bishop Hunt to demonstrate the influence of Smith on Wordsworth in 1970, although Smith remained a minor poet. By the 1980s the situation was changing rapidly. Perhaps this is because, in many respects, the critical climate began to reflect the same cultural preoccupations of Smith’s own age: a fascination with recovering the poetry of the past, a market predisposed to female anthologies and biographies, and a feminist interest in the plight of the woman in history. Smith had maintained a place in the popular female histories and collections in the nineteenth century, and had begun to be taken seriously by the academy in the twentieth century. In the 1990s, however, Smith enjoyed a popularity matched only during her own lifetime, with three separate reprints of the Elegiac Sonnets appearing during that decade. With the scholarship of Stephen Curran, and the academic anthologies of Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, and Andrew Ashfield (amongst numerous others), Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism. This is most clearly exemplified in the recent appearance of Jacqueline Labbe’s monograph on Smith, which explores Smith’s work beyond the constraints of gender and establishes her as a major influence on Wordsworth. As our definitions of Romanticism have been radically redefined, Smith may have finally achieved the winning combination of popularity and posterity.” (Duckling 217)

            <Title>many definitions of DH</Title>
            <Text>The many criticisms which Klein compiles, Bode argues, “describe the symptoms – not the essence – of a problem, which in fact inheres in Moretti’s and Jockers’s common neglect of […] the bibliographical and editorial approaches that explore and explicate the literary-historical record,” a neglect which is itself “not an effect of importing data into literary history but is inherited from the New Criticism” \cite{Bode:2017gb}.

Klein also suggests a change in how models are formed: “Instead of first asking what can be modeled—what phenomena we can track at scale—we might instead ask: what might be hidden in this corpus? And are there methods we might use to bring out significant texts, or clusters of words, that the eye cannot see?” \cite{Klein:2018to}.The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological. These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.” Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life. This kind of work is increasingly described as “digital cultural studies.” In positioning this work as a “DH” dissertation, I might at first glance seem to belong squarely within the first framework, that of the “computational humanities.” To be sure, much of this work is intended to apply existing computational methodologies to conduct otherwise old-fashioned literary research. My objects of study are by no means contemporary. Several of my contributions, too, are purely methodological in nature, in the development of new code and new guidelines for computational research using particular digital resources. However, as a fuller discussion of Johanna Drucker’s distinction between “data” and “capta” will elucidate later in this chapter, no computational research exists separately from a specific, local, culturally-defined context. Accordingly, my computational research into eighteenth-century literature and my development of new computational methodologies are both inevitably tied to “digital culture.” My results often have more to say about contemporary digital archives, and the history of literary record-keeping, than they do about the eighteenth century itself. I therefore rely on an extensive body of work in cultural digital studies to examine not only the eighteenth century, but eighteenth century studies.</Text>

            <Title>TCP partnership</Title>
            <Text>Bullard suggests tentatively that university presses might be site of bridging efforts between the non-profit and for-profit worlds, but where we can actually see an example occurring is in the Text Creation Partnership. The TCP attempted to intervene in the system with “a public-private partnership, led by libraries” (TCP, “About”); their materials emphasize the “librarian’s attitude toward content” which prioritizes the widest possible access and use. This “librarian’s attitude” is most evident in the (eventual) availability of all of the transcriptions in the public domain, despite the fact that the images they are based on remain privately restricted by the companies which own them. Their description of the “partnership,” however, continues to show signs of the strain in value systems when commercial and noncommercial goals are intertwined: “Through our partnership with private vendors, we had access to a huge trove of images from which to transcribe. In return, these companies were supplied with a full-text index to their images —work which would have otherwise been difficult or expensive to produce.” In other words, through purchasing a service (access to images), the academic institutions received that service. These academic institutions carried out an enormous feat of labour at their own expense, using the service they purchased. Then, “in return,” they provided the results of their labour to the company, for the company to then further profit from the improvements to their service. Most telling, here, is the word “otherwise” in calling this “work which would have otherwise been difficult or expensive to produce.” The suggestion here is that, without the TCP, the companies themselves would not have been willing to undertake the encoding that was so desired by the users of their service. However, the TCP certainly did not make the task any less difficult or expensive. Instead, academic institutions absorbed the difficulty and expense on those companies’ behalf. I do not say that they were wrong to do so: on the contrary, the “librarian’s attitude” mirrors my own attitude, and it is surely to everyone’s benefit for a wonderful thing to exist even if that wonderful thing is not profitable. Rather, I highlight this rhetorical moment in the TCP’s self description to suggest that it takes two to collaborate, and that no amount of effort on the librarians’ part can change the core institutional drive of a private company. Companies like Gale are perfectly happy to help achieve maximally useful scholarly resources if doing so it also a good way to turn a profit, but this does not mean that they have the same goals as academic institutions. One of the three key aims of the TCP identified on the homepage is to “collaborate with commercial providers, rather than constantly bargaining and competing with them” (TCP “Welcome”). However, the TCP seems instead to have simply come up with a better bargain, one which creatively offers scholarly labour as a bargaining chip.</Text>

            <Title>what to teach: convo with Jack copy</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

            <Title>distant reading without Moretti</Title>
            <Text>To bring these principles into the field of Digital Humanities by way of an example, I want to offer an alternative geneaology for the practice of distant reading itself. Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernen provide a valuable history of Josephine Miles as the first ‘distant reader’. Miles’ history, briefly, is as follows:
In the 1930s, as a graduate student at Berkeley, she completed her first distant reading project: an analysis of the adjectives favored by Romantic poets. In the 1940s, with the aid of a Guggenheim, she expanded this work into a large-scale study of the phrasal forms of the poetry of the 1640s, 1740s, and 1840s. In all of this distant reading work, Miles created her tabulations by hand, with pen and graph paper. She also directed possibly the first literary concordance to use machine methods. In the early 1950s, Miles became project director of an abandoned index-card-based Concordance to the Poetical Works of John Dryden. Partnering with the Electrical Engineering department at Berkeley, and contracting with their computer lab and its IBM tabulation machine, Miles used machine methods to complete the concordance. It was published in 1957, six years after she and several woman graduate students and woman punch-card operators began the work. It was thus begun around the time that Busa circulated early proof-of-concept drafts of his concordance to the complete works of St. Thomas Aquinas, and published 17 years before the first volumes of the 56-volume Index Thomasticus began to appear. (Buurma and Heffernan)
Buurma and Heffernan bring Miles’ history to our attention not simply because Miles predates Roberto Busa, whose Index Thomisticus is often credited as the first large scale computational literary study. Rather, they emphasize, Miles’ origin story for computational literary study “can stand as an example of how we might write a history of literary scholarship that does not center originality and individual accomplishment” (n. pag.). Unlike Busa, Miles not only gave authorship to the (female) graduate students who carried out much of the labour of creating the concordances, she also thanked and credited the (female) punch card operators who encoded the resulting data. Moreover, when talking of Penny Gee, one of the female staff members of the computer lab, Miles praises her as “‘very smart and good’ and—most importantly—a true collaborator, as opposed to those ‘IBM people from San Jose’ … ‘I’ve never been able to connect with them,’ Miles explains, ‘though I did with Penny Gee. She really taught me’” (n. pag.). Of the positive qualities highlighted here, only one, “smart,” is traditionally valorized among literary critics: to be “good,” a “collaborator,” who can “connect” and “teach” — these qualities are often seen as irrelevant to the singular authority of the figure of the critic, but they are core to a reparative practice. Miles’ work, too, struggled to find appreciation “among literary critics who viewed her datasets as merely preparatory to the true work of evaluation” (n. pag.).</Text>
            <Comments>Ted Underwood’s “Genealogy of Distant Reading” presents a history of distant reading which is not for the most part centrally concerned with computers, and is therefore fundamentally distinct from concepts of “digital humanities” \cite{Underwood:2017uc}. In Underwood’s history, distant reading is “a tradition continuous with earlier forms of macroscopic literary history, distinguished only by an increasingly experimental method, organized by samples and hypotheses that get defined before conclusions are drawn” (Underwood:2017uca p.29}. Underwood “tease[s] out the elided social-scientific genealogy behind distant reading” \cite{Underwood:2017uca p.39} to argue that the term “[d]istant reading was not coined to describe a radically new method. The first occurrence of the phrase, in [Franco Moretti’s] ‘Conjectures on World Literature,’ seems in fact to describe the familiar scholarly activity of aggregating and summarizing previous research” \cite{Underwood:2017uca p.9}[ what is your position on this? You go on to Buurma who does connect distant reading to computation - and you suggest how you will draw on similar ideas about collaboeation etc - but this underwood bit dangles].

Indeed, Buurma notes, “There are good reasons, of course, that scholars and journalists like to begin with Busa: he was the first concordance-maker to automate all five stages of the process, in 1951,” and he intentionally foregrounded and publicized the innovative nature of his work. \cite{Buurma:2018wt}
In the interest of preserving this history of citation, the students were Mary Jackman and Helen S. Agoa, credited on the cover of the published Dryden index. (Miles herself attached her name only to the preface.) From the computer lab staff, Miles particularly thanked Shirley Rice, Odette Carothers, and Penny Gee. </Comments>

            <Text>“Although influenced by both Moretti’s and Jockers’s work, this book begins rather differently: with a critique of their approach. Chapter 1, “Abstraction, Singularity, Textuality: The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading,” argues that distant reading and macroanalysis offer an inadequate foundation for data-rich literary history because they neglect the activities and insights of textual scholarship: the bibliographical and editorial practices that literary scholars have long relied on to interpret and represent the historical record. Textual scholars understand literary works as events—unfolding and accruing meaning across time and space—and the documentary record as partially and provisionally expressing that process. By contrast, distant reading and macroanalysis conceive data and mass-digitized collections as providing direct and unmediated access to the historical literary record and reduce literary works to texts, perceiving them as singular and stable entities, related to each other in history via basic categories of production. The models of literary systems that Moretti and Jockers construct on this basis are limited, abstract, and often ahistorical.
Such inattention to the historical and material nature of the documentary record is inherited from, not in opposition to, the New Criticism and its core method of close reading. Close readings are generally protected from the worst consequences of such underlying assumptions by the disciplinary infrastructure that textual scholars have produced, and by the documentary context in which such readings are enacted. The same cannot be said of distant reading and macroanalysis, which take the problematic assumptions of close reading to an extreme conclusion. The problem with these prominent approaches is not that they introduce new quantitative methods, inimical to nuanced literary-historical understanding, as has been argued. Rather, distant reading and macroanalysis construct and seek to extract meaning from models of literary systems that are essentially deficient: inadequate for representing the ways in which literary works existed and generated meaning in the past. The solution to this problem is not rejecting data-rich literary history, nor proposing new, more elaborate forms of computationalPage 6 → analysis; it is not even integrating computational and noncomputational methods, as is often proposed. These solutions define the issue in terms of the method of analysis used, when the foundational problem is the lack of an adequate object to analyze: one that is capable of managing the documentary record’s complexity, especially as it is manifested in emerging digital knowledge infrastructure, and of representing literary works in the historical contexts in which they were produced and received.” (5-6)

“Underappreciated in commentary on distant reading and macroanalysis is the shifting meanings of both terms. When Moretti originally proposed distant reading in “Conjectures on World Literature” in 2000, it was a “new critical method” for world literary studies, not for literary history (55). Distant reading aimed to overcome the focus on national canons by collating the work of multiple scholars to identify and explore “units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems” (57).” (Bode 19)
“ Although literary data remains central, the primary object of distant reading is now less often literary systems—designated social, material, and political contexts for literary development and change—than the “concepts of literary study” (1). And while Moretti previously identified the importance of literary systems in their inclusion of the “great unread” (“Conjectures” 55), these concepts of literary study (including characterization, plot, and dramatic form) are approached predominantly through formal and computational analyses of canonical literary works.” (Bode 20)

“in their literary-historical work both Moretti and Jockers present literary data and digital collections as precritical, stable, and self-evident. In conceiving data and computation as providing direct and comprehensive access to the literary-historical record, they deny the critical and interpretive activities that construct that data and digital record and make them available for analysis.” (Bode 20)

Bode attributes Moretti’s failings to “Moretti’s lack of interest in the scholarly infrastructure that enables his analyses.”(21)
“In presenting digital “archives” or collections as “there to stay,” Moretti disregards their status—like bibliographies—as interpretative constructs. And unlike print-based bibliographies, most digital collections are constantly changing: a dynamism with significant practical and conceptual challenges for literary history.” (Bode 22)

“According to Jockers, literary scholars “have the equivalent of . . . big data in the form of big [digital] libraries . . . [or] massive digital-text collections,” and these enable “investigations at a scale that reaches or approaches a point of being comprehensive. The once inaccessible ‘population’ has become accessible and is fast replacing the random and representative sample” (7–8). As Jockers says of one of Moretti’s analyses, such unprecedented and supposedly uninterrupted access to the documentary basis of literary history “leaves little room for debate” (20): a perspective that overlooks the fact that all collections are selections, made according to (implicit or explicit) arguments about value, and with varying degrees of expertise and funding.” (Bode 22)
“While Moretti occasionally acknowledges limitations in his data (before proceeding with analyses regardless), Jockers maintains that any “leap from the specific to the general” is flawed because based on interpretation (28).” (Bode 23)

“A recent collaboration of the Stanford Literary Lab, which Jockers Page 24 →is no longer part of, departs in one important way from the approach to literary history, data, mass digitization, and computation I have described (Algee-Hewitt et al.).5 Literary Lab Pamphlet 11 closely attends to the gaps between “the published” (all literary works made public in history), “the archive” (the portion of what was published that has been preserved and is now increasingly digitized), and “the corpus” (the segment of the archive selected for a research question). Although incorrectly imagining that the “convergence of these three layers into one . . . may soon be reality,” in acknowledging that this state has not been achieved, the authors admit the constructed—and selective—nature of literary data. Yet Pamphlet 11 follows Moretti’s and Jockers’s precedent in misconstruing the nature of our disciplinary infrastructure, in that the authors presume to overcome the selections and biases of mass-digitized collections by using analog bibliographies to generate “a random sample” of what was published (2). This strategy misses the vital point that both digitized collections and analog bibliographies are derived from “the archive,” predominantly the collections of major (usually American or British) “university libraries. Pamphlet 11 also replicates Moretti’s and Jockers’s approach in not publishing its datasets.6” (Bode 23-24)

“In Moretti’s case, one might suppose it possible to reconstruct his datasets from cited sources. But his account (in an appendix to Graphs) of creating the dataset for “British novelistic genres, 1740–1900,” highlightsPage 25 → why this is not feasible. There he describes his periodization as “not always explicit” in the bibliographies (31), thus evincing the role of his own—unpublished and therefore unspecified—interpretive decisions in data construction. And even if Jockers listed all the titles and authors he analyzed, it would be impossible to reconstruct the basis of his arguments without access to the textual data he uses, which are not just texts of literary works but highly prepared—or preinterpreted—selections from those texts. Neither critics nor supporters of Moretti’s and Jockers’s methods typically comment on this lack of published data. But far from an incidental oversight, this practice maintains the fiction that literary data are prior to interpretation: it removes the need either to describe the procedures for collecting, cleaning, and curating datasets or to expose the inevitably selective and limited collections resulting from that construction.” (Bode 24-25)

“The meaning derived from a literary-historical dataset—like the interpretation of a literary work—is shaped, profoundly, by the methodological and critical frameworks through which it is approached, and by the selections and amplifications those frameworks produce. Two scholars can read the same dataset—like the same literary work—and derive different meanings. …“In the absence of data publication, distant reading and macroanalysis are analogous to a scholar finding a set of documents in an archive or archives, transcribing them, analyzing those transcriptions, publishing the findings, and asserting that they demonstrate a definitive new perspective on the literary field, without enabling anyone to read the transcriptions (or in Jockers’s case, without revealing the titles of most of the original documents).” (25)

“In modeling literary systems, Moretti and Jockers define literary works as single entities in time and space, typically located as such by the date of first book publication and the author’s nationality. Literary works are constituted as literary systems when they share these basic features—as in “nineteenth-century” or “British” novels—with other characteristics added within that framework (such as the author’s gender or the work’s genre).” (26)

“William St Clair’s The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period aptly diagnoses the limitations of this approach. Like Moretti and Jockers, St Clair rejects what he calls the “parade of authors” convention in literary history, where canonical authors file past the commentator’s box in chronological order, taken as representative of the historical period in which they wrote. But he equally dismisses the “parliament of texts” approach, where literary works first published at a particular time, and usually by authors of a particular nationality, are understood as “debating and negotiating with one another in a kind of open parliament with all the members participating and listening” (4). As St Clair notes, literary systems frequently include “texts written or compiled long ago and far away” (3), and some literary works are inevitably more widely published, circulated, read, and referenced than others.” (27)

“The date of first book publication overlooks the differing availability of literary works in the years after they are published and that first book editions are not necessarily—and for many periods are rarely—the first time works are available…. Likewise, an author’s nationality is a poor marker for the geographical existence of a literary work in a marketplace that has been globalized since at least the eighteenth century. More broadly, the construction of literary systems from the categories supplied by enumerative bibliographies—the title, the author, the date of publication, the publisher, and by association, the text—ignores the different titles, author names, dates and places of publication, and texts that occur as literary works are issued and reissued,Page 28 → and the implications of these differences for understanding production and reception.” (27-28)

“Because [Jockers] is modeling a diffused and generalized system, the “influence” of gender, genre, temporality, and nationality is in turn diffuse and generalized.
The inadequacy of this conception of literary systems is foregrounded when Moretti considers readers, who, as Anne DeWitt notes, “are both central to his argument and absent from his evidence” (162). Moretti takes literary data on publication and/or formal features of literary works as both expressive of and explicable by the actions of readers and the market.” (Bode 29)

“Moretti proposes a framework for canon formation, wherein readers are the “butchers” of literary history “who read novel A (but not B, C, D, E, F, G, H . . .) and so keep A “alive” into the next generation, when other readers may keep it alive into the following one, and so on until eventually A becomes canonized. Readers, not professors, make canons.” (67) Nominating formal choices as the reason readers select certain titles over others, Moretti employs the example of detective fiction and decodable clues to demonstrate this process. He identifies the presence of such clues in Arthur Conan Doyle’s fiction as the reason that author was progressively selected by generations of readers to attain his now canonical status. Again, this is an interesting but circular argument. ” (Bode 30) — this is his evolutionary theory of detective fiction paper

“Moretti assumes that authors who have a canonical status in the present were selected from the time of first publication. This argument is intrinsic to his evolutionary model, and while Moretti supports it by citing an empirical study (68), others show its falsity. St Clair, for instance, demonstrates the minute early nineteenth-century readerships of five of the “big six” Romantic male poets (excepting Byron) who form the contemporary canon (660): however that Romantic canon was formed, it was not Page 31 →based on the poetry contemporaneous readers preferred. ” (Bode 30-31)

“My argument is not against reduction and abstraction per se. While especially obvious in data-rich studies (which rely on identifying attributes that can be represented in uniform fields), reduction and abstraction characterize all analysis. Close readings do not interpret literary works as a whole but specific, extracted instances of particular, abstracted features of those works. What I am arguing is lost in Moretti’s and Jockers’s approach—especially in their definition of literary systems as analogous to first book publication by authors of a designated nationality—is precisely a historical sense of “interconnection.”” (Bode 31)

“close and distant reading are conceived as antithetical in their assumptions and approaches. However, the main problems I have sought to diagnose in distant reading and macroanalysis—a disregard for textual scholarship and an assumption that literary works are stable and singular entities—are ones they share with the New Criticism and its foundational method of close reading. Distant reading and macroanalysis take the core object and premise of the New Criticism—the decontextualized text as the source of all meaning—to a conclusion rendered more abstract and extreme by the number of texts under consideration.” (Bode 32)
“Despite the apparent demise of the New Criticism, the continuing centrality of close reading in literary studies, including literary history, and the rhetorical focus of such research on the text, perpetuates the earlier movement’s dismissal of textual scholarship (Cain). As Eggert (“Book”), McGann (“Note”), and others have observed, assuming that literary works are texts, and that texts Page 33 →are single, stable, and self-evident entities, dismisses the documentary record’s multiplicity, and with it the critical contributions of those endeavors—bibliography and scholarly editing—dedicated to investigating and understanding that multiplicity.” (Bode 32-33)
“close readings are generally protected from the abstraction inherent in the notion of the text by the knowledge infrastructure in which they are embedded, and by a focus on particular documents. Scholarly editions provide critics with carefully historicized texts for consideration; when one is not available, the standard practice of bibliographical referencing ties discussion of the supposedly singular text to a version of the work. … Distant reading and macroanalysis do not benefit from such provisions or protections; to the contrary, as this chapter has argued, these approaches negate the interpretive nature of the disciplinary infrastructure they use, as well as their own role in constructing the meaning of the data they derive from it.” (Bode 33)
“Moretti’s investigations of readers based only on data relating to first book publications enacts this view of the text as inevitably containing all that is relevant to interpreting it. In treating the literary system as a dispersed linguistic field, Jockers takes the rhetoric of text to its ultimate conclusion, proposing a literary-historical world in which there are no structures beyond the textual. …“Far from the opposite of close reading, the dematerialized and depopulated understanding of literature in Jockers’s work enacts the New Criticism’s neglect of context.” (Bode 34)

“When a gap exists between the contemporary object assessed and the historical object it supposedly represents—and when the critic is unaware or dismissive of that gap—no degree of nuance or care in the reading can supply that historical meaning. Herein lies the fundamental problem with proposing to integrate close and distant reading as the obvious way forward for research in literary history. … Yet in couching debate about the role of data purely in terms of method, this response maintains the focus on the mode of analysis employed and conceals the lack of an adequately historicized object to analyze. What data-rich literary history needs is an object capable of representing literary systems—as manifestations of literary works that existed and generated meaning in relation to each other in the past—while managing the documentary record’s complexity, especially as it is manifested in new digital knowledge infrastructure. The lack of such an object, not the fundamental opposition of data and literature, is the real reason it has proven so difficult, in practice if not in theory, to Page 35 →integrate “traditional and computational methods” for the purposes of historical investigation (Gibbs and Cohen 70).” (Bode 34-35)

“The second, original meaning of my title was as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the view that mass digitization offers “a world of fiction”: unmediated access to every work from every time. This is the complacent attitude that chapter 1 criticizes in the two paradigms in data-rich literary history that dominate external perceptions of the field: Moretti’s distant reading and Jockers’s macroanalysis. These authors proclaim their opposition to close reading, even as they assume, in common with that midcentury critical mode, that literary works are stable and singular objects, reducible to “the text.” I attribute this equivalence between close and distant reading to a common disregard for the critical nature of the disciplinary infrastructure (analog and digital) that enables the study of literature, and for the historical insights such infrastructure presents. In distant reading and macroanalysis, the idea that mass-digitized collections and the literary data derived from them provide direct access to the facts of literary history yields models of literary systems, and arguments made on their basis, that are abstract, limited, and often ahistorical.” (Bode 203)</Text>

This is a massive and complex book, again written from a Marxist perspective, focussing on the period from the French regicide in 1793 to the British treason trials of 1794–95.It investigates how agents of the British state sought to make the act of imagining the King’s death a treasonable offence. Their argument was that thinking and writing about revolution would promote it, and revolutions, as the French example showed, killed kings. Many (including the juries who tried those arrested for ‘thoughtcrimes’ like these) could not agree, but Barrell shows how both conservatives and radicals engaged with the argument about the political power of imagination. </Text>

Word embeddings allow for analogy checking. For example, man is to king as woman is to queen, expressed as man:king :: woman:queen, has its reflection on the vector representions of the words man, king, woman, queen in such a way that  king→−man→+woman→≈queen→king→−man→+woman→≈queen→ . However, this can also highlight some biases in the specific corpora the model has been trained on. Using as a base the pair she-he, find the most similar term for female from the term in the next list: doctor, captain, gallant, sheriff, engineer, scientist, author, surgeon, honorable, philosopher, warrior, architect, magician, liar, and coward. 
When possible, compute the similarity between the expected term for female and the one for male. Use the Google News (2015), English Fiction (1900, 1950) and Genre-Balanced American English (1900, 1950) embeddings. For example, using the English Fiction 1850 embeddings, he:gallant :: she:x solves to x=gentle, and the similarity between gallant and gentle is ~0.418. Can you spot the problem? 
Hint: Use Gensim's most_similar_cosmul()/most_similar() and similarity() functions

Really cherry-picking the "interesting" results; scroll right past the total nonsense and latch onto anything that can be vaguely thinks

By comparing how different the he:X :: she:X results are, we can quantify the gendered bias within the corpus, to skeptically evaluate our corpora

Very hard to remove gendered bias without removing the other relationships that interest us

Not just corpora that are biased; because the algorithm depends on the corpus, it will become biased too</Text>

“p.9: I agree with Laura Mandell’s recent analysis of the “Distant Reading Debates” between Moretti and Katie Trumpener and between John Guillory and N. Katherine Hayles found in Critical Inquiry and Profession that much of the resistance to counting over reading elides that, in a sense, we are all already “digital humanists” using the computer and Internet as valuable tools.”

“p.9: the suggestion implicit in databases such as EEBO and ECCO that this deluge of texts they make available is complete, constituting a form of universal coverage, leads the average users, especially the average students, to be lulled into a false sense that they now have access to “everything.” This in turn reinforces a belief that if you don’t find something—an author, a text, and a document—in these massive digital repositories, it did not exist, leading once again to the past being defined by what it does not have, by absence.” (Ezell)

“p.10: Laura Mandell offers an insightful appreciation of how the digital humanities can help to alter the historical literary landscape through its ability to specify the minute elements that create the text on a page: the coding involved in the creation of digital texts, those choices made in the software, can “carve up reality in a new way that has, or should have, a tremendous impact upon our discipline.” 11 Echoing Jerome McGann, she posits that the very act of “coding any cultural artifact first and foremost establishes differences among kinds of data: sound image, and differential sign systems (for example, the alphabet, numbers, mathematical functions),” making us acutely aware of textual features as we attempt to create digital markup schemes for printed texts.”</Text>

            <Title>Ann Radcliffe - scholarship</Title>
            <Text>In contrast to the brevity of Radcliffe’s bibliography and biography stands the mountain of secondary writing on her works. [NOTE: This section remains incomplete, with only a rough sketch of the literature review in place.] During her lifetime, Radcliffe was widely reviewed and discussed. Scholars have often examined Radcliffe’s responsiveness to reviews of her works, with each new novel changing the aspects which was critiqued most strongly in the previous.  [So she ultimately produces Gothics that reviewers are willing to accept on their own moral terms — and therefore Gothics which subsequent generation are willing to accept/praise?]
At her death in 1823, despite the twenty-six years since her last publication, an outpouring of obituaries marked her as an esteemed literary genius. Much of this praise followed the template so famously set out in Walter Scott’s ‘Prefatory Memoir to Mrs Ann Radcliffe’ in the tenth volume of James Ballantyne’s Novelist’s Library series. Despite Scott’s dismissive attitude toward the other romances that beguiled his youth, “he nonetheless takes care to defend the unquestionable genius of Ann Radcliffe on at least three accounts: her presiding over ‘a separate and distinct species of writing’ (Scott 1824: xx); her ability to sustain her readers’ interest and attention across three major novels … and her exploration of extreme human passions in appropriately southern European settings” (Townshend and Wright 5-6).
Since Scott, Radcliffe has continued to be consistently praised and studied, often in ways that establish the worthlessness of works similar to her; a ‘token’ who justifies the exclusion of women or feminine writing. In 2014, the volume Ann Radcliffe, Romanticism and the Gothic, edited by Dale Townshend and Angela Wright, commemorated 250 years since Radcliffe’s birth. In this volume, Radcliffe has weathered multiple changes in the critical landscape” “Once-dominant psychoanalytic and feminist interpretations have given way to critical work drawing on political and religious history, print culture studies, theories of media and remediation, and new formalism” (Carson 127).</Text>

            <Title>OGS Plan of Study 2019</Title>
            <Text>Plan of Study 
In literary study, scholars increasingly embrace the methods of “distant reading” to study hundreds or thousands of texts using computational tools. As an alternative to “close reading” (the practice of meticulously reading and researching the language of small selections of individual texts), distant reading promised an exciting opportunity to expand the borders of which literature would merit serious attention. However, in the nearly twenty years since Franco Moretti coined the term “distant reading” in his “Conjectures on World Literature,” the introduction of computation has not changed the preference for a limited, selective canon. A recent article by Kathleen Bode exemplifies a current shift in digital humanities research. Bode critiques pioneers of distant reading and literary macroanalysis Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they use as proof of their arguments. As an alternative, Bode calls for an integration of computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history, which she terms a “data-rich literary history.” My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799, to redefine our understanding of the definitive works of this decade. 
Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building (that is, the accumulation of a large body of text files for analysis) to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to explore how works from this eleven-year “decade” have been selected as important, literary, or popular. For this period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts — the source for most distant reading research on eighteenth century literature — includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? 
My experiments examine six major databases to answer these questions: The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. For each database, I download their holdings identified as printed in England 1789-1799. I calculate how many works are attributed to male, female, or unknown authors. I then examine the contents of each database more closely, to compare the inclusion of broad categories of writing like poetry, drama, prose fiction, sermons, non-fiction, and ephemera. Identifying these categories of writing within each corpus reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry (rather than non-fiction or sermons) in the smaller databases. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation. If novels are mostly written by women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of selection. 
I have completed my data collection, begun writing the necessary code to carry out my experiments, and written my first chapter. The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the sixth year of my PhD, during which I will complete code development and write two chapters.

            <Text>This dissertation undertakes computational distant reading. At every possible point, however, the underlying methodology will be made visible, and its assumptions scrutinized. The bibliographic histories of my multiple corpora are explicit objects of inquiry. Much of the code underlying this project I have written myself. Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A (“Codebase”), accompanied by a plain language explanation of how it operates. Where I have used closed-source software, Appendix A contains an explanation of my best guess at its underlying process. My exact use of these tools — sufficient for another to replicate my work — is provided in Appendix B (“Methodology”). These details are explicated in full in the appendices in order not to over-burden the body of the dissertation, but they are by no means confined to the appendices. Computation is not a “black box” to be consulted for simple answers, but is inextricable from my reasoning and argument.</Text>

The younger generation of scholars in particular, lured by full-text images and ransacking the Web for illustrations for their books and articles, are using these utilities as de facto bibliographic databases. They find that the stripped-down records and simplified indexes are good enough for their purposes. To a minority of them, the fact that other works, editions, and copies exist outside the Web is irrelevant, and perhaps even irritating.” (Tabor 368)</Text>

            <Title>Prior, Hannah More</Title>
            <Text>“Not surprisingly then, judgments of More’s work cover an equally broad span of critical interpretation. Received with near-universal praise and adulation during her lifetime and immediately following, More quickly became, like many elements of the eighteenth century, outdated by the revolutionized England of the nineteenth century. Eventually, More slipped into obscurity, where she remained for much of the twentieth century. However, with the latter part of that century’s proliferation of new modes of interpretation and with it the re-discovery of lesser-known, under-appreciated authors and works, renewed attention has been given to More, repeating in simultaneous fashion the varied views that occurred over the course of the previous two centuries.” (Prior)

“To some recent critics, More is a reactionary, patriarchal foil to her radical feminist counterpart, Mary Wollstonecraft, an advocate for a conservative, counter-revolutionary sort of progress for women. Other critics, in recognition of her call for reform across all social strata, place More somewhere in between these extreme views. This variety of critical views points to the complexity of both More and the age of paradigmatic change in which More occupied an unusual position: born in the middle-class, she was embraced by the London elite and ministered to the poor; a devout Anglican she offered shelter to French Catholic priests exiled during the French Revolution; an educated and literary woman in a highly-gendered society, she overcame traditional gender boundaries while rejecting the revolutionary call for the rights of women; she shared, nevertheless, with Wollstonecraft the freelover a call to the reformation of women’s education along with the reformation of the manners and morality; a product of the Age of Reason, she appealed to sensibility in her attempts to address slavery, poverty, and irreligion.” (Prior)

“More’s writing now aimed more directly at a conservative agenda of reform that excluded no social class. While all of these works are conservative in assuming the preservation of class boundaries, they are progressive in their belief that individual reform is possible within one’s class, whether high, middle, or low. Such a position is now variously interpreted along a spectrum of critical views. Some critics accuse More’s efforts of serving merely to reinforce class boundaries by alleviating the worst distresses of poverty without eradicating it; others see her attempts as ultimately more effective because modest reform rather than radical revolution was more widely acceptable and achievable.” (Prior)

“The success of the Cheap Repository Tracts led More to expand these didactic short sketches and tales into a full-length novel. This was a rather bold undertaking since novels at this time were still viewed, particularly among conservatives like More, as a tawdry form of entertainment with base appeal. More had even offered her own disdain for novel-writers in her Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education. Nevertheless, encouraged by her fellow Claphamites, she published in late 1808 what would be her only novel, Cœlebs in Search of a Wife: Comprehending Observations on Domestic Habits and Manners, Religion and Morals. Part essay, part conduct book, and part novel, the book tells a fairly straightforward if longwinded account of – as the title makes clear – a young bachelor’s search for a wife. Interspersed among the various characters and incidents are observations and lessons on a range of topics such as education, child rearing, religion, and charity. By numerous accounts, the novel was one of the most widely-read and bestselling books of its kind. Indeed, it can be argued that More’s single attempt at novel-writing played a key role in helping the novel form to achieve the respectable status necessary for it to reach the artistic and literary height of the Victorian age. The fact that its unabashed didacticism renders it nearly unreadable today offers great insight into the vast literary and cultural changes that have taken place between More’s day and our own.” (Prior)

“With a lifetime that spanned the Augustan age to the Victorian age, and a writing career nearly as long, Hannah More can be considered at once both the intellectual child of the Age of Johnson and, in spirit if not quite in chronology, the ‘first Victorian’.” (Prior)

“To some recent critics, More is a reactionary, patriarchal foil to her radical feminist counterpart, Mary Wollstonecraft, an advocate for a conservative, counter-revolutionary sort of progress for women. Other critics, in recognition of her call for reform across all social strata, place More somewhere in between these extreme views. This variety of critical views points to the complexity of both More and the age of paradigmatic change in which More occupied an unusual position” (Prior)

“More’s writing now [i.e., in the 1790s] aimed more directly at a conservative agenda of reform that excluded no social class. While all of these works are conservative in assuming the preservation of class boundaries, they are progressive in their belief that individual reform is possible within one’s class, whether high, middle, or low. Such a position is now variously interpreted along a spectrum of critical views. Some critics accuse More’s efforts of serving merely to reinforce class boundaries by alleviating the worst distresses of poverty without eradicating it; others see her attempts as ultimately more effective because modest reform rather than radical revolution was more widely acceptable and achievable.” (Prior)</Text>

            <Title>Bullard on ESTC</Title>
            <Text>The story of ESTC is one in which a closed ideal of authoritativeness is being relinquished slowly for the sake of more useful and modern qualities: evolution, accuracy, and depth. The printed versions of STC and Wing presented themselves as definitive bibliographies of English printing for the periods that they covered. Being native to the digital medium, by contrast, the nature of ESTC is that it is always a work in progress. What David McKitterick calls the ‘dispersed authority’ of the ESTC is represented by the existence of its daimon, a parallel database accessible only to the editors and librarians authorized to work on it, known as the STAR file.15 This is the repository for all updates and queries, all doubts about the reliability of edition designations and library matches, and for some time now commentators have been calling for it to be made accessible to ordinary users.16 At the time of writing, the ESTC21 blog indicates that this will soon happen: the catalogue is about to be redesigned so as to ‘harness user expertize to enrich data’.17 The database will function increasingly as an ‘electronic hub’ capable of searching digital reproductions of texts, and moves will be made to improve the accessibility of ESTC data for recapture by other websites.18 This brings us to the second reason for the ESTC’s preeminence. The hybridity of the resource ought to be its great weakness. The description of a typical copy from an edition in the upper part of its record is really a sort of ideal generalization, a specification that in fact describes many nonidentical objects. A thousand contingencies at the warehouse or the bookseller’s stall, at the binder’s shop or the library lead inevitably to variations within editions or impressions. So the authority of the upper record is under constant pressure from the material particularity represented by the lower part, the copies registered in the union catalogue. In fact, it is the pragmatic yoking of these two theoretically incompatible classes of information that gives the ESTC its versatility. The balance between ideal description and material referent is successful because this is true to ESTC’s nature as a bibliographical workhorse, focused on the business of practical specification. For my own part, I would be uncomfortable seeing the ESTC moving into the realm of content provision or text searching, because that balance and that focus would both be lost. They are essential to the identity of this indispensible public resource. (Bullard 750)</Text>

            <Text>“The preliminary remarks on the question of value in Chapter 1 argue that the process of canon formation cannot be reduced to acts of evaluation in the simple sense of affirming or rejecting the specific values assumed to be expressed in a literary work.” (269)

“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
"the vulnerability of curricular revision to attack from the right is one consequence of the contradiction between integrationist and separatist conceptions of curricular revision, a / contradiction that can be traced to theoretical problems with pluralism itself, and that threatens to disable an effective response to the conservative backlash.” (3-4)
language of revision comes from a specifically American political culture -- have to historicize them &amp; acknowledge this context to solve underlying problems
“however easy it has been for both progressive academics and their reactionary critics to conflate the critique of the canon with the forms of leftist and even Marxist thought, the terms and methods of canonical revision must be situated squarely within the prevailing conventions of American pluralism." (4)
ONE kind of ‘representation': “Within traditional liberal pluralist thought, individuals are conceived in their relation to the state as members of groups whose interests are assumed to conflict. Hence the object of representing these groups within the legislative institutions of the state is to negotiate among the interests of particular social groups” (4)
universities are interested in 'representation in the canon' because representation in politics (its proper place) is seen to have failed -- as liberal pluralism is purged from society its last bastions adopt its defensive positions rigidly and with high stakes (5)
“two pervasive theoretical assumptions" implicit in the current canon debate: (6)
1. term ‘canon’ as replacement for ‘classics’ seeks to critique 'classics’, and treats the “traditional curriculum of literary texts" as equivalent to a closed and normative object akin to the scriptural canon. (6)
--- interrogate: is the selection of religious texts actually similar, historically, to the selection of literary texts? (a historical Q subject to proof or disproof) (6)
2. assumed similarity between exclusion (in which social minorities are excluded from power of political representation) and selection (by which some works are deemed canonical and others noncanonical). assumes that the solution is easy, add minorities to canon. (7)
--- interrogation: there is *some* relationship between minorities in power and minorities in canon, but what is it? the university intervenes between these two sites of representation. (7)
"The literary curriculum is precisely not the side of mass cultural production and consumption, but the critique of the canon has proceeded as though it were, as though canon formation were like the Academy Awards. ... in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site.” (8)
"it has seemed necessary to many progressive critics to present certain texts by minority authors as /intrinsically/ noncanonical, as unassimilable to the traditional canon.” (9)
"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the /actively/ excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)
—&gt; the stuff I'm doing comparison databases will probably show that it's NOT, e.g., social repression of women which has led to various exclusions, but a series of convenience principles
“The sense in which a canonical author represents a dominant social group, or a noncanonical author a socially defined minority, is continuous with the sense in which the work is perceived to be immediately expressive of the author's /experience/ as a representative member of some social group. ... The author returns in the critique of canon, not as the genius, but as the representative of a social identity.” (10)
“the coherent identity demanded by a practice assuming the perfect fit of identity and experience is in fact unavailable to anyone” (10)
liberal pluralism's emphasis on identity in determining canonical status is essentialist (10)
the ultimate “policy" position of opening the canon is seen as too politically important to allow theoretical objections to complicate its plan (because canonical representation is now standing in for political representation) (11)
lumping together race, class, and gender as all "noncanonical” "equates their works as the expression of analogous experiences of marginalization” (11)
his post-Maxist critique is different from a liberal pluralist critigue because he is "insisting on the theoretical and practical incommensurabiliy of the terms race, class, and gender: the modes of domination and exploitation specific to each of these socially defined minorities thus cannot be redressed by the _same_ strategy of representation.” (11)
treating all minorities as equivalent, and defined by their oppression, is bad and useless politics (12)
“If liberal pluralism has discovered that the cultural is always also the political (which it is), it has seldom escaped the trap of reducing the political to the cultural.” (13)
“The underlying theoretical problem here… [is] … theoretical slippage between the concepts of ‘subject' and ‘identity’” (13)
"The fact of incommensurability explains why the revisionist critique of the canon has in practice been incapable of identifying 'noncanonical' works by lower-class writers who are not already identified by race or gender.” (14)
"the category of 'social identity' is entirely inadequate to explain how particular works become canonical in the first place” (15)
“the current critique of the canon both discovers, and misrepresents, the obvious fact that the older the literature, the less likely it will be that texts by socially defined minorities exist in sufficient numbers to produce a 'representative' canon" (15) —  but is this ACTUALLY true??
“The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from /access to literacy/, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” (15) — yes: and the presence of women in a genre generally made it seem to be ephemeral rather than serious… which isn't QUITE exclusion, but also doesn't seem like it's what Guillory is noting
“If current research has recovered a number of otherwise forgotten women writers from the period before the eighteenth century, this fact is not directly related to canon formation as a process of selection or exclusion on the basis of social identity, but to the present institutional context of a valid and interesting /research program/ whose subject is the history of women writers and writing. No other defense is required for studying these writers than the aim of the research program (and these could well be /political/ aims. It is not necessary to claim canonical status for noncanonical works in order to justify their study” (15)
“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is what any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as /excluded/ from the canon.” (16)
"The hypothesis of exclusion" is “a misrecognition of the political work accomplished by the research program”, which “has certain political consequences, since it effaces the historical significance of literacy in the history of writers and writing.” (16)
"the historical process of canon formation, even or especially at the moment of institutional judgment, is too complex to be reduced to determination by the single factor of the social identity of the author” (17) gender may contribute somewhat to the reception of a given author, but it cannot in itself *explain* canonical/noncanonical status
“the categories of race and gender are contemporary conditions of canon formation; they are historically specific" (17)
“An 'institutional’ fact such as literacy has everything to do with the relation of 'exclusion' to social identity; but exclusion should be defined not as exclusion from representation but from access to the /means of cultural production/.” (18)
"literacy is a question of the distribution of cultural goods rather than the representation of cultural images” (18)
“pluralism can only apprehend the history of canon formation as a history of consumption, the history of the judgment of cultural products” but obviously production must precede this (18)
“The educational institution performs the social function of systematically regulating the practices of reading and writing by governing access to the means of literary production as well as to the means of consumption (the knowledge required to read historical works)." (19)
"failure to reflect upon the most salient fact of the canon debate, its locus in the university. No one speaks there of the relation between canonical revision and the primary levels of the educational system, where for a much larger part of the population the content of the university curriculum is simply irrelevant.” (19)
"In the second phase of canonical critique, the curriculum became representative in another sense, by reflecting the /actual/ division of the social order into dominant and dominated social groups, each now represented by its own syllabus of works. In this context of representation, the ‘values' according to which works were canonized could themselves be called into question or declared to be simply incommensurable with the 'values’ embodied in subordinate cultures.” (19)
"On this account canonical and noncanonical works are by definition mutually exclusive; they confront each other in an internally divided curriculum the same way that hegemonic culture confronts nonhegemonic subcultures in the larger social order.” (20)
“pluralist critics of the canon would agree that canonical works do represent the 'ideals of Western civilization,' and that these ideas or values constitute a culture. Whether Homer, Shakespeare, Eliot, and Austen actually express in some homogenous way a culture of 'Western civilization' is not in question on either side of the debate” (but it should be, and it's a sign of pluralism’s failings that it agrees with the premises of the right wing) (21)
profs either have to stop teaching the canon (“an entirely logical alternative, if the teaching of canonical texts actually disseminates hegemonic values”) or frame the course around exposing them (21)
“three propositions about cultural value to which both progressive and reactionary critics would presumably assent, in order to remonstrate that these propositions are questionable” (22)
“1. Canonical texts are the repositories of cultural values.” (22)
“the pedagogic relation between value and the literary work is very much keyed to the level of the educational system." (22)
“At the level of the graduate school and the professional conference, the educational capital specific to that level can be signalled by a certain refusal of the 'great works’ characteristic of the lower levels of the system." (22)
"2. The selection of texts is the selection of values.” (23)
“The distinction between serious and popular writing is a condition of canonicity” (23)
he's sort of addressing the idea that women are associated with "unserious”, “ephemeral" writing possibly due to sexism which sees women's writing as inherently unserious and ephemeral... but mostly he's talking about popular vs serious
“how unhistorical it is to claim, as Jane Tompkins does in /Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction/, that popular fiction 'has been rigorously excluded from the ranks of 'serious' literary works,' as though the two categories did not define /each other/ in a system of literary production" (24) — serious works are inherently unpopular?
“The reversion to moralism is determined by the equation of text-selection with value-selection. For this reason much of what passes for political analysis of historically canonical works is nothing more than the passing of moral judgment on them.” (25)
"a fall into moralism will occur regardless of what values are set against the category of the asethetic” (25)
Jauss on horizon of expectations actually seems interesting / useful to me
“3. Value must be either intrinsic or extrinsic to the work." (26)
"the strategy of exposing intrinsic value as simply extrinsic has the curious effect of disabling at the outset any project of revaluation, where the object revalued is the work, and not (as in Tompkins) other extrinsic (moral) values.” (26)
"An individual's judgment that a work is great does nothing in itself to preserve that work, unless that judgment is made in a certain institutional context, a setting in which it is possible to insure the reproduction of the work, its continual reintroduction to generations of readers.” (28)
“The scene in which a group of readers, defined by a common social identity and common values, confronts a group of texts with the intention of making a judgment as to canonicity, is an /imaginary/ scene. That imaginary scene must now be set against what happens in a real place, the school.” (28)
is the constituency for Norton anthologies really UNIVERSITY students? are "textbooks" and "instruments of research" really synonymous??
it's anthology editors, not women or african americans, who decide what texts make up the “"alternative canon"" of Norton's anthologies of literature by women &amp; african american literature (29)
“judgments with canonical force are institutionally located.” (29)
“It is nevertheless an interesting consequence of the canon debate that is has called every act of judgment into question, not simply because judgment is always historical, local, or institutional, but more profoundly because it is exercised at all.” (29)
"The curious logic of this argument conflates the syllabus, a selection of texts for study in a particular institutional context, with the canon itself" (29)
“In no classroom is the 'canon' itself the object of study. Where does it appear, then? It would be better to say that the canon is an /imaginary/ totality of works." (30)
"Anyone who studies historical literatures knows that the archive contains an indefinite number of works of manifest cultural interest and accomplishment. While these works might be regarded as 'noncanonical' in some pedagogic contexts -- for example, the context of the ‘great works’ survey -- their noncanonical status is not necessarily equivalent in anyone's judgment to a zero-degree of interest or value.” (30)
the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
"So far from being the case that the canon determines the syllabus in the simple sense that the syllabus is constrained to select only from canonical works, it is much more historically accurate to say that the syllabus posits the existence of the canon as its imaginary totality.” (31)
“Obviously in order to ‘open' this canon, one would have to /modernize/ it, to displace the preponderance of works from earlier to later. And there are of course many good reasons to do so. The pressure to modernize the curriculum has succeeded again and again” (32)
"The fact that we read Plato but not Xenephon, Virgil but not Statius, has nothing to do with the social identities of Xenephon or Statius, something more to do with later evaluations of their relative interest; but the necessity of choosing between them has everything to do with the modernization of the curriculum, with the imperative of /making room/ for such later writers as Locke or Rousseau." (32)
“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)
"The syllabus has the form of a list, but the items on the list are given a specious unity by reference to a whole from which they are supposed to be a representative selection. ... The canon achieves its imaginary totality, then, not by embodying itself in a really existing list, but by retroactively constructing its individual texts as a /tradition/, to which works may be added or subtracted without altering the impression of totality or cultural homogeneity.” (33)
"The confusion of the syllabus with the canon thus inaugurates a pedagogy of misreading, wherein a given text's historical specificity is effaced as it is absorbed into the unity of the syllabus/canon.” (34)
"the present very anxious fixation on the canon… can be read as symptomatic of a certain anxiety associated with the perceived disunity of contemporary society." (34) — trying to create new cultural unities around gender, race, ethnicity, queerness
distinction between "community" and "association" -- pluralism misrecognizes minority cultures as communities when they are in fact associations (34)
the university is also an association, not a community (35)
we're really into lists (35)
E.D. Hirsch's /Cultural Literacy/ included a list of "what Hirsch believes to be a quantity of knowledge prerequisite to functional literacy" (35)
"The fetishized list is one symptom of... the ‘postmodern condition of knowledge’” (36)
"The form of the list forecloses any systemic analysis of its own terms on behalf of a nostalgia in which Agamemnon and Akron might truly belong to a ‘common culture.' The nonexistence of this culture, or its actual existence as mass culture, is just the fact which Hirsch's list both manifests and denies.” (36)
“the fetishized mass cultural form of the list, as an instance of the social imaginary, determines the form of the critique of the canon in the university, the fixation on the syllabus as an exclusive list.” (36)
“the pedagogic imaginary within which the critique of the canon has been advanced… constructs out of its alternative canon/syllabus/list a culture (or women writers, or Afro-American writers, etc.) more homogenous than it actually is” (37)
"The 'open' canon can lay claim to representational validity in the experience not of 'women' or ‘blacks' but of women or blacks in the university -- which is not itself a /representative/ place. The university is nevertheless a locus of real power (for the distribution of cultural capital), and therefore a good place for political praxis to define its object. Such an object should not be the imaginary alone, the canon as image” (37)
revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)
section: "Multicultural Interlude: The Question of a Core Curriculum" (38)
schools don't transmit national culture, they transmit the culture of the school (38)
"The apparent failure of the university's cultural project of constituting a national culture elicits from the New Right the clamorous demand for a return to what was after all the /bourgeois/ school, the institution enabling the old bourgeoisie to identify itself culturally by acquiring the cultural capital formerly restricted to the aristocratic or clerical estates. The capital consisted of nothing other than the 'great works' of Western civilization." (40)
schools give access to and transmit works, not cultures (41)
"If works by Afro-American, Latin-American, or postcolonial writers are read now in formal programs of university study, this fact may be the immediate result of a political project of inclusion, or the affirmation of cultural diversity. But the survival of these works in future school curricula will be seen otherwise, as a consequence of their status as interesting and important cultural works that no intellectually responsible program of study can ignore.” (41)
“The homogenizing textual effects of deracination" unifies texts of ""Western culture”"  that are from vastly different cultures -- made obvious by the fact that we read them in translation (43)
"The function imposed upon schools of acculturating students in 'our' culture often thus requires that texts be read 'out of context,' as signs of cultural continuity, or cultural unity.” (43)
since the decline in the humanities is due to lower enrolment as students gravitate toward pre-professional tracks, why does it get blamed on prof's (supposed but false) refusal to teach Great Works?
“It has proven to be much easier to quarrel about the content of the curriculum than to confront the implications of a fully emergent professional-managerial class which no longer requires the cultural capital of the old bourgeoisie.” (45)
"The decline of the humanities was never the result of newer noncanonical courses or texts, but of a large-scale 'capital flight' in the domain of culture.” (45)
“I would propose, then, that the division now characterizing the humanities syllabus — between Western and multicultural, canonical and noncanonical, hegemonic and nonhegemonic works-- is the symptom of a more historically significant split between two kinds of cultural capital, one of which is ‘traditional,' the other organic to the constitution of the professional-managerial class.” (45)
“the debate... will have to move beyond the curricular distinction between the canonical and the noncanonical; it will have to raise the much larger question of what is at stake in the relation between the kinds of cultural capital.” (45)
“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its /market/ value." (46)
“If the liberal arts curriculum still survives as the preferred course of study in some elite institutions, this fact has everything to do with the class constituency of these institutions. …it is only those students who belong to the financially secure upper classes who do not feel compelled to acquire professional or technical knowledge as undergraduates." (46)
“It is not quite the case, then, that the New Right wishes to purge the university of all linguistic or ethnic others, but that it sets the university the project of unifying the new possessors of cultural capital by cultural means, by means of a ‘common' curriculum which will identify them as (justly) privileged.” (47)
“If this analysis is correct it does not seem the most effective strategy for the left to cede to the right the /definition/ of cultural capital; but this is exactly what multiculturalism does when it…accepts the right's characterization of the canonical syllabus as constitutive of a unified and monolithic Western culture.” (47)
"This is finally why the project of legitimizing noncanonical works in the university produces an irresolvable contradiction between the presentation of these works as equal in cultural value to canonical works, and at the same time as the embodiment of countercultural values which by their very definition are intended to delegitimize the cultural values embodied in canonical works.” (47)
"Both the right-wing attempt to shore up the cultural capital of ‘great works' by advocating a return to a core curriculum, and the pluralist advocacy of multiculturalism respond to the same demographic circumstances, the heterogeneous constituency of the university. But neither version of culturalist politics responds to the heterogeneous constitution of cultural capital, and hence both movements are condemned to register this condition symptomatically, as a false perception of the mutual (cultural) exclusivity of canonical and noncanonical works." (47)
Gramsci proposes a unitary school to foster equal access to citizenship, as an antidote for the stratification encouraged by technical schools (49)
the things he proposes as unitary, in America move farther from the common public schools and end up happened only in the first two years of university (49)
"The point of the unitary school is that it is a school for everyone; by definition it is not the university.” (50)
“It is perhaps time for progressive teachers to take back the humanities curriculum -- all of it -- as an integrated program of study.” (50)
“we can imagine that an integrated curriculum would supersede the distinction between canonical and noncanonical works in the recognition that a syllabus of study always enacts a negotiation between /historical/ works and /modern/ works. There is no question now, not has there ever been, of the inevitability of curricular change: the latter-day curriculum is the archaeological evidence of its own sedimented history. When we read Plato or Homer or Virgil in a humanities course, then, we are reading what /remains/ of the classical curriculum after the vernacular revolutions of the early modern period.” (51)
"The fact that we no longer read these works in Greek or Latin, or that we read far fewer classical Greek or Latin works than students of premodern school systems, represents a real loss; but this loss must be reckoned as the price of the /integration/ of these works into a modern curriculum. The inevitable loss of older works in any humanities curriculum…is the result, as we have observed, of the /absolute/ accumulation of cultural works.” (51)
“The reactionary defense of the traditional 'canon' thus betrays itself as ignorant of the cultural history sedimented in the very syllabus it desires to fix.” (51)
the syllabus isn't about the actual titles at all, it is “the means of providing /access/ to cultural works, both historical and modern” (51)
“Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To contend otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
teaching ‘minority' works is important because it reflects the real diversity of the nation, and they are therefore important to everyone, not just to separate minority constituencies (52)
“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works /because they are important and significant cultural works/. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
“There is not, and should not be, one national culture, but there is, and there should be, one educational system." (53) in order to avoid social re-stratification

university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
Section: "Literature as Cultural Capital: An Alternative Analysis”
“Canonicity is not a property of the work itself but of its transmission, its relation to other works in a collection of works -- the syllabus in its institutional locus, the school.” (55)
“Whatever the relation of the / work to its initial audience, it must certainly have other relations as a canonical work.” (55-56)
"The canon is thus not grounded in an ‘institution of criticism’” but in schools (56)
“The school functions as a system of credentialization by which it produces a specific /relation/ to culture. That relation is different for different people, which is to say that it reproduces social relations." (56)
the structure of the institution subordinates the historical specificity of individual works to the ideology of the canonical form (tradition), which leads to a homogenizing of dogmatic content (57)
"Institution of reproduction succeed by taking as their first object not the reproduction of social relations but the reproduction of the institution itself.” (57) --MEMES. Do I need meme theory in the diss??
syllabus reform has little impact on the education system as a whole or society at large (57)
"Canons of texts belong to the /durée/ of the school as both an objectification of ‘tradition' and as a list of text (syllabus, curriculum) continuously changing in response to the frictional relations between institutional and social reproduction. Yet the significance of this tension between the two sites of reproduction is concealed from revisionists of the canon, who see a direct relation between the canon and social struggle but misrecognize the institution mediating this relation as a mythical 'interpretive community,' or an autonomous ‘profession.’" (59)
“The objective history of canon formation…exhibits enormous variation, but this history can be recovered only in the context of the school” (59)
history of the distinction of “literary" texts (60)
“social reproduction is not effected directly through the contents of the curriculum” -- example of Roman empire teaching old-fashioned literature, but this was fine because the real goal was to teach the Latin language itself (61)
Roman classical texts chosen in order to teach grammar -- much of what survives today is because it was anthologised for this purpose (62)
“selections of texts historically have the appearance of having selected themselves" (62)
"The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
"Only in this way can one explain the use of the /same/ canonical works to inculcate in different generations of students many different and even incompatible ideologies.” (63)
"Authors cannot be said to write /for/ the educational system but in a determinate relation to it, /as the subjects it produces/. The history of canon formation belongs to the history of literary production, therefore, as a condition of production” (63)
“Authors confront a monumentalized textual tradition already immersed as speakers and writers in the social condition of linguistic stratification that betrays at every level the struggle among social groups…over cultural capital in its linguistic form.” (63)
“When these authors are joined to the frieze upon which they formerly gazed, the record of struggle seems to pass into oblivion as the unwritten. Yet that record is immediately available in the works themselves as the /language of literature/, out of which literature is made, and in the process of canon formation [the record is available] as the institutional intervention by which the literary curriculum becomes the pedagogic vehicle for producing the distinction between credentialed and uncredentialed speech." (63)
the “ideology of tradition...collapses the history of canon formation into an autonomous history of literature, which is always a history of writers and not of /writing/“ (63)
“A history of / writing would... have to pose first the question of what genres of writing count as 'literature' in a given historical context” (63-64)
“the first theoretical movement in the twentieth century explicitly to reject the concept of tradition, namely, Russian Formalism” (64)
will be helpful to use "the Bakhtin circle's reformulation of the question of literary language as the question not of an /essentially/ different kind of language (literariness) but of linguistic differentiation as a social fact." (64)
“The ontological groundlessness of literature in no way diminishes it social effects as a means of marking the status of certain texts and genres.” (65)
"the polarization of linguistic practices into the poetic or literary, and the ordinary or practical, generated an attractively simple and elegant model of historical transformation conceived as an oscillation between the processes of familiarization and defamiliarization" (65)
“‘Literary language' does indeed ride the crest of a historical wave, but not as the defamiliarized or the new. On the contrary, it forms at the interface between the language of preserved literary texts and the context-bound speech that continually escapes total regulation and hence /changes/. It is different from both." (67)
“the ‘older poetic genres’, preserved as nothing other than canonical texts, exert a kind of drag on the velocity of linguistic change, the product of which interaction is 'literary language’” (67)
“Bakhtin's description of the novel as a genre, specifically the 'noncanonical genre,' by which he means that it never develops generic rules (canons) even as it accumulates a repertoire of works. The novel as noncanonical genre is privileged for Bakhtin as the genre which welcomes the heteroglossic” (67)
“Literary language also changes, if at a slower pace than extraliterary language” (68)
“Canonical texts, institutionally preserved and disseminated, constitute the paradigmatic basis of literary language, the guarantor at the lower educational levels of simple grammatical speech, the exemplar, at higher levels, of more expansive as well as more elite standards of linguistic use (stylistic or rhetorical rather than simply grammatical norms)” (68)
“If the term 'literature' can be retained to indicate a transhistorical phenomenon at all, it would have to be defined as the canonical genres of writing, whatever these genres happen to be in any particular time or place, and whatever name may have been given to them collectively. We are speaking, then, of certain genres of writing which become paradigmatic for a socially differentiated speech." (69)
“Diglossia defined as a differentiation of social/linguistic function" (70)
“comparing the medieval curriculum, founded upon specialized discourses of knowledge (the trivium and quadrivium) with the curriculum of the early modern humanist schools, founded on a canon of classical literary works… this transition, which relegated to obscurity a great number of medieval works, has unfortunately appeared to literary historians primarily as a revaluation of particular authors and texts.” (70)
The Historical Forms of the Literary Canon
"Within the history of canon formation we will always be able to discern the arrangement and rearrangement of (1) an institutional practice, or pedagogy; (2) a body of preserved and disseminated writings, or canon; and (3) a produced linguistic knowledge” (71)
his history of literary canons enters the 18thC
"it is only vernacular writing that has the power to bring into existence the category of 'literature’ in the specific sense of poetry, novels, plays, and so on. The brackets that close around a particular set of genres at this time increasingly distinguish it on the one side from philosophical and scientific writing, and on the other from scripture” (76)
“The very fact that the body of literary works can be analogized to the scriptural 'canon' betrays the fact that vernacular writing must borrow the slowly fading aura of scripture as a means of enhancing and solidifying its new prestige.” (76)
“the ends of nationalism were served not simply by the establishment of vernacular classics but even more crucially by the use of the texts in the schools as a means of standardizing the vernacular language." (77)
“The existence of the novel at the interface between literate and illiterate culture produced a crisis in poetic production itself, symptomatically registered by the Romantic break with the 'poetic diction’ of eighteenth-century poetry, and its turn to a prose paradigm of ‘generalized literariness.’” (77)
“while the standard or 'common' language seems to efface social stratification by making language itself the vehicle of common national identity, the 'literary’ language reinstates at another level a linguistic difference by which the upper classes can continue to mark their cultural distinction.” (78)
“the cognate programs of composition and literature, yet another way in which 'different practices of the same language are inculcated in the school." (79)
"the program of composition has never been so limited as to identify grammaticality as its sole end; it has on the contrary posited grammaticality as the means to emancipatory political ends which are not finally different from the posited political ends of literary education. Like the law, grammar is the same for everyone, except of course that it is not.” (79)
the language taught in composition classes “is employed in its place, the ‘office.’ It is not 'everyday' language.” (79), and “its production bypasses the older literary syllabus altogether.” (79)
“Mistaking the class-based sociolect for the language of 'humanity' is an Enlightenment dream from which the political subject is not meant to awaken.” (80)
"The crisis of the literary syllabus is that it is indeed no longer such a privileged agent because it is no longer the basis of the vernacular standard.” (80)
“The relative decline of literary study in the schools is proof that the status of literary works as cultural capital depends to a significant degree upon their status as linguistic capital." (81)
“I shall continue to insist that the project of political integration is distinct from the project of cultural assimilation, and is in fact the basis for the latter's critique.” (82)
"A politically effective critique of literary education would be better served now by discarding the problematic of representation for a problematic whose object is the systematic constitution and distribution of cultural capital. For if social groups now imagine that they are too different to speak the same language, or to be represented by the same cultural works in the schools, they are nevertheless always exchanging the same currency, even in the symbolic form of cultural capital. In the case of literature the problematic of cultural capital will always return us to the question of the relation between the means of literary production and the institutions of social reproduction within which speakers succeed or fail to speak for themselves." (82)

Footnotes
“The phenomenon of "political correctness," recently the object of so much com- plaint in the right-wing media, can be seen in this context as the paradoxical tri- umph in the university of an otherwise defeated liberalism. It is not surprising that a progressive discourse, more or less routed in American culture, should find itself driven to police the borders of its diminished territory. As everyone on the left knows, the concept of political correctness was formulated within left discourse itself to critique the tendency to moralistic posturing provoked by the dire situation / of an increasingly reactionary social order. The usefulness of that concept is cer- tainly at an end, but one may continue to speak of "identity politics" or what I would call "radical liberalism," a specific style of political discourse and practice distinct from the historical forms of socialism and Marxism. The argument of this chapter with liberalism, both traditional and radical, is not with any of its progres- sive objectives, but with those assumptions of its theory and practice which, be- cause they are uncritically shared with American political culture in general, have disabled an effective response to the resurgence of reactionary politics. Taking the long view historically, there is considerable evidence for arguing that "identity poli- tics" is now American politics, and that what we call identity politics exists on the same continuum of "interest-group" politics with positions that are manifestly conservative or reactionary. Identity politics makes no conceptual break as a poli- tics with its precursors, even in its radical forms. I do not doubt that to those who are traumatized by the demise of liberalism, the alternative of a class-critique will seem even more quixotic; but it seems to me that it is in just this circumstance that a mode of systemic analysis recommends itself, and that certain foreclosed truths may become visible once again.” (342-343)

“See Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: To- wards a Radical Democratic Politics (London: Verso, 1985). Also interesting in this context, and perhaps neglected by literary postmodernists, is the work of Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, particularly their Democracy and Capitalism: Prop- erty, Community, and the Contradictions of Modern Social Thought (New York: Basic Books, 1986). Because Bowles and Gintis, unlike Laclau and Mouffe, are / writing in response to an indigenous liberal tradition, they tend to emphasize the necessity for socializing the economy at the same time that it is democratized. Laclau and Mouffe do not disagree, but the very intimacy of their struggle with the Continental Marxist tradition, and the consequent vehemence of their post- Marxism, has had the unfortunate effect of underemphasizing for American readers the socialist commitments they also claim as their own.” (343-344)

Else- where, it should be noted, Gates has produced very effective critiques of certain as- pects of the "representation" view of canon formation, among them the fetishizing of authenticity and individual experience. For a more complete view of the complex evolution of Gates's thinking on the subject of the canon, see his Loose Canons: Notes on the Culture Wars (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992).” (344)
“In this context, see David Harvey, "Flexibility: Threat or Opportunity?" in So- cialist Review 21 (1991), 74: "The postmodern embrace of ephemeral images, spectacle-type events, 'invented' traditions and heritages of all sorts, and perpetual novelty in the realm of cultural production deserves to be understood. . . . In recent years the cultural mass has pursued a whole host of political and ideological strug- gles that have general significance: anti-racism, feminism, and struggles concerning ethnic identiy, religious tolerance, cultural decolonization, and the like. Because postmodernism is associated with a democratization of voice within the cultural mass, many of the struggles against a central source of authority and power (white, male, elitist, and Protestant, for example) have enlisted under the postmodern ban- ner. I think it is fair to say that efforts to counter various forms of gender, racial, ethnic, or religious oppression have been more successful within the cultural mass than in many other segments of society. The problem is that these fights are being / waged within a relatively homogeneous class context, where issues of class oppres- sion, though always on the agenda for political reasons, are by no means as strongly and personally felt as they would be among, say, women factory workers in the Phil- ippines or Mexico." Harvey's understanding of the socioeconomic forces driving postmodern culture leads him to a thoroughgoing skepticism about the "ideologi- cal struggles" of the newly constituted cultural minorities. While I do not share the degree of Harvey's skepticism about the political significance of these struggles, there is a sense in which we might see the critique of the canon in the context of the new social movements as the latest version of a kind of left Hegelianism. The ideal- ism of this critique consists in the belief that in order to change the world it is only necessary to change our image of the world. This is a question not of the reality of images but of the virtual absence of economic or class analysis in liberal pluralist theory. The absence of such analysis permits First World pluralists to construe the question of postcolonialism, for example, primarily as one of rehabilitating our im- ages of the native cultures and identities of postcolonial populations, a program that does not begin to address the steadily worsening effects of what Immanuel Wal- lerstein has called the"capitalist world-system." See also Harvey's The Condition ofPostmodernity: An Enquiry into the Origins ofCultural Change (London: Basil Blackwell, 1980); also Immanuel Wallerstein, Geopolitics and Geoculture: Essays on the Changing World-System (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991).” (344-345)

“'fhe concept of a "minority author" should itself be submitted to critique. The unresolved contradiction between the assertion of equivalence vis-a-vis the experi- ence of marginalization or oppression and the assertion of difference at the level of specific gender, racial, or ethnic identity is one consequence of identity politics, and accounts for at least some of the tensions expressed between different minority groups over the actually quite limited resources available for compensating disad- vantaged groups. These tensions follow from the fact that the name of "minority" is superimposed upon specific gender, racial, or ethnic identities as another identity, a general identity which paradoxically effaces the very specificity which is the basis for the claim to that general identity. This contradiction can only be superseded in the recognition that the concept of "minority" names a historically determinate relation between dominant and subordinate social groups in a specific social con- text. The tensions between such groups in the practice of identity politics suggests that in identity politics' practice of traditional interest-group politics, the interest of the group is defined on the basis of a hypothetically preexistent identity (essential, if not natural), and not on the basis of an analysis of the objective conditions giving rise to that identity. Hence the apparent absence of analogy between, say, one's ra- cial identity, and one's identity as a "consumer"-but the obvious contingency of such "identities" as the latter is also the reason why it is so difficult to translate class position into the identity of "minority author.”” (346)

“Giving class its due does not, it should be emphasized, reduce the phenomena of race and gender to aspects of class; the point of insisting upon the incommensurability of these categories is only that nothing explains class but class.” (348)

“The dovetail- ing of new forms of historical scholarship with a critique of the canon has produced the quite interesting misapprehension that writing about a given author is equiva- lent to canonization of that author.” (348)

“It is simply taken for granted that any woman writer not currently canonical is ipso facto "lost or undervalued," as though it really did not matter how such texts came to be, or what social condi- tions enabled or constrained the practice of writing for different social groups. 
While I have not undertaken to give a full account in the text of the relation bet- ween the distribution of cultural capital (access to the means ofliterary production) and the position of women in the system of distributions, the lineaments of such an account can be briefly indicated. We might begin by reconsidering two leading questions guiding the current account of women writers in the history of canon for- mation: First, is the fact of the transhistorical oppression of women sufficient to explain the exclusion of women from the means of literary production, if not from the canon itself? And second, does this fact imply that such oppression operates autonomously from class structure? Fortunately history does not enjoin upon us any choice between a transhistorical sexism and a historical class analysis. A prop- erly historical question would be: What determines women's access or lack of ac- cess to the means of literary production at any given historical moment? While transhistorical sexism always makes women available to occupy disadvantaged lo- cations in the social order, it is only the historical class system which determines how they will be so disadvantaged. In the premodern sexual division of labor, women occupy a different site in the system of production than they do after the emergence of generalized commodity production. The same system which "com- modifies" women in new ways also permits them to produce new commodities (such as novels), to become new kinds of cultural producers. The historical class system of capitalism produces a new sexual division of labor, or a rearticulation of transhistorical sexism on the system by which material and cultural capital is dis- tributed.” (349)

“We might also note here that the very American style of liberal pluralist critique has made the entire debate about the canon seem rather mystifying to European critics. See, for example, AliceJardine's and Anne Menke's interviews with fourteen French feminists in a recent issue of Yale French Studies 75 (1988). Jardine and Menke discovered to their surprise that French feminist writers found it difficult to become exercised over the problem of the canon, and that they were even incredu- lous that it had become a feminist issue in America: "It was hard for us to under- stand how so many could profess indifference to inclusion of their own work in the canon. And inclusion was not the only problem: for many of these women the word 'canon' does not refer to the literary tradition, and few of them see it as an area of feminist concern" (230). Here, to cite one response, are Monique Wittig's remarks, which are not untypical: "To say that writers have been excluded from the canon because they are women seems to me not only inexact, but the very idea proceeds from a trend toward theories of victimization. There are few great writers in any century. Each time there was one, not only was she welcome within the canon, but she was acclaimed, applauded, and praised in her time-sometimes especially be- cause she was a woman. I'm thinking of Sand and Colette. I do not think that real innovators have been passed by. In the university, we ruin the purpose of what we do if we make a special category for women-especially when teaching. When we do that as feminists, we ourselves turn the canon into a male edifice" (257).” (352)

“Commenting in an interview about the experience of editing the Norton An- thology o f Afro-American Literature, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., points to the differ- ence between a research program and the exercise of judgment in an institutional context: "When I was in grad school in the 1960s everything black that could be found was reproduced. But some of it was terrible. We've got to make discrimina- tions within the corpus of black literature, and to keep that which is worth keep- ing." These remarks are reproduced in Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education, p. 172.” (352)

“It is perhaps time to recognize that it is only the emergence in our own time of social identity as a positive criterion of judgment (as the basis, in Lauter's phrase, of establishing a "more representative and accurate literary canon") that requires a revisionist history in which social identity is the major neg- ative criterion of judgment.” (353)

“In fact there exists a large body of critique on the subject of the curriculum and its function within the educational system, critique of which the canon debate has remained largely oblivious. See, for example, Michael Apple, Teachers and Texts: A Political Economy ofClass and Gender Relations in Education (New York: Rout- ledge, 1988), and Michael Apple, ed., Cultural and Economic Reproduction in Ed- ucation: Essays on Class, Ideology and the State (London: Routledge, 1982); or Stanley Aronowitz and Henry Giroux, Education Under Siege: The Conservative, Liberal, and Radical Debate over Schooling (South Hadley: Bergin and Garvey, 1985). These works include extensive bibliographies as well. The absence of ref- erence to such work in the debate about the canon, and indeed the absence of comment about the relation between the university curriculum and the curriculum at lower levels of the system, testifies to how entirely the debate has been conducted in the pedagogic imaginary of university teachers. On the actual state of the public school system in the U.S., see Jonathan Kozol's vivid account, Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools (New York: Harper, 1991).” (354)

“See the entry for "culture" in Raymond Williams's Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, revised edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976.1983),87-93,foralucidaccountofwhatisatstakeinthedifferentmeaningsof "culture" historically. We might sum up the difference between our national culture and our school culture by acknowledging that for national culture "Nike" is the name of an athletic shoe, for school culture a Greek goddess.” (354)

“Bourdieu, "Systems of Education and Systems of Thought": "Because of its own inertia, the school carries along categories and patterns of thought belonging to different ages. In the observance of the rules of the dissertation in three points, for example, French schoolchildren are still contemporaries of Saint Thomas. The feel- ing of the 'unity of European culture' is probably due to the fact that the school brings together and reconciles-as it must for the purposes of teaching-types of thought belonging to very different periods" (352). What I have been calling a "text tradition" is obviously the site of critical judgment, in the sense that the entire do- main of intertextu~,lity, or response to earlier by later writers, is a powerful agency for the preservation of these writers. Nevertheless I have consistently argued for locating the site of canon formation in the school, for the reason implied by Bourdieu in the passage just quoted. The point of the sociological argument, for both Bourdieu and myself, is that authors learn whom to read and how to judge in the schools, and that even the judgment of recent but uncanonized work must even- / tually be validated in the passage of writers into school curricula in order for one to speak of canonicity. One should not forget that literary history is filled with the names of writers whose high standing with other, more famous authors was still insufficient to insure their canonicity.” (355-356)

“Alvin W. Gouldner, The Future ofIntellectuals and the Rise ofthe New Class, 21. Gouldner argues persuasively that" An investment in education is not simply a consumable. Something is left over, which produces a subsequent flow of income. It is cultural capital, the economic basis of the New Class" (27). On the other hand, I am not convinced that the problem-solving orientation of the New Class consti- tutes what Gouldner calls a "culture of critical discourse." This is not to say that the professional-managerial class has not produced some forms of social criticism-it has-but that this criticism is seldom systemic (it is usually anti-state but not anti- capital). I am also aware that arguments against systemic critique have been made on certain "post-Marxist" grounds. Foucault's concept of the "specific intellec- tual" might in this context be compared to Gouldner's concept of the New Class intellectual. My own argument follows Bourdieu, however, in his version of sys- temic critique.” (356)

“An example: If the sheer formal atavism of an institution such as the church suits the function of social reproduction, the prestige deriving from its atavistic fea- tures can as well become the ground of resistance in a complex agonistic game re- quiring the expenditure of that prestige as cultural capital. Consider the fate of the Sanctuary movement in the mid-1980s: This movement staged the literalization of the church's institutional autonomy as the autonomy of its physical space, the imaginary "sanctuary" within which political refugees from the right-wing Latin American dictatorships could take sanctuary. Before such an elegant atavism, even our authoritarian state paused, though not for long.” (357)

“For an interesting and provocative argument about the relation between canon formation and British imperialism, see Gauri Viswanathan, Masks of Conquest: Literary Study and British Rule in India (New York: Columbia University Press, 1989). Viswanathan tends to date the for- mation of the English vernacular canon somewhat later than 1 do, but we share some assumptions about the nationalist motives which are in part the support of the school system and of the imperialist project.” (360)

“The implications of this fact within the developing discourses of Romanticism have been summarized most astutely by Michel Beaujour in an essay entitled "Ge- nus Universum," Glyph 7 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980): "If this segregation [of scripture from other forms of writing] corresponds but imper- fectly to the distinction between the uses of Latin and the Vulgar tongues in medi- eval culture, it seems clear that the coexistence of a priestly tongue and various lay languages resulted in the institutionalization of a dichotomy: it is no accident there- fore that the post-Romantic period attempted to re-instate this duality within var- ious vulgar literatures in order to counteract the tendency to homogenization and equality that accompanies the removal of a sacred hierarchical principle, and the fading away of a hieratic language used at the top (and beyond the top) of the scale" (18). The "re-instatement" took the now familiar but little understood form of a supposed transcendence of genre by truly "literary" works; these works form the super-genre or genus universum of literature itself. “ (360)

            <Title>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British</Title>
            <Text>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British Novel (1994) also investigates the associations between fictional form and politics. For Watson, novelists on both sides of the Revolution debate realised that there was a clear connection between some major themes of the novel and the political debates of the 1790s. The sentimental novel’s depiction of a heroine choosing her own lover in defiance of parental authority,for example,might correlate with disobedience towards political authority,just as an attempted seduction of a heroine could stand for the attempts of insurgents to tempt unwary Britons into sedition. Watson argues that both conservative and radical novelists tried to exploit these metaphorical connections, making the majority of 1790s novels much more political that they might at first appear. Even the very form of the novel,Watson contends, was a political statement in itself. Epistolary novels, for instance, were inherently political because the letter was a deeply suspect article in the 1790s, standing for secret communi- cation between people and connected with espionage, with the evidence used in treason trials and with the radical ‘corresponding societies’ (established in Britain to communicate directly with the Revolutionaries in France). </Text>

I write to propose a paper for your MLA panel on “New Histories of Quantitative and Computational Methods,” in the optimism that perhaps something like MLA will in fact occur this year. A title and abstract are included below, and my CV is attached.

Title: “Project Gutenberg’s Textual Selection and Editing”

Abstract: My work examines the history of digital infrastructures, and how databases encode their assumptions about what literature is, who it is for, and how it should be used. For this paper, I discuss Project Gutenberg, a repository of over 60,000 public domain ebooks which began in 1971 as a utopian project by a single person, Michael Hart, who personally typed the first 100 Project Gutenberg texts over a period of twenty years. I examine Hart’s early textual selection through the lens of cultural capital, as applied to literary history by John Guillory: Hart, I argue, was in some measure trying to bring about the material revolution in textual access that Guillory and Bourdieu (and so many others) have advocated. Why, then, does Project Gutenberg now occupy such an uneasy, marginalized position among scholars who share these goals? I answer, in part, that Project Gutenberg defines itself in hostile opposition to scholarly norms of textual selection and editing; as a result, it can seem like Project Gutenberg does not simply have different standards, but no standards. Like much work in critical algorithm studies, my methods move between something like formalism (close-reading the implications of particular data structures) and a historicist approach (drawing on materials like listserv messages to situate technological decisions in a social context). Explicating the technical specifics of Project Gutenberg may be of practical use to scholars using it in their research, since it is one of the oddities I discuss that Project Gutenberg is almost as widely used as it is disavowed. More importantly, taking seriously the historic foundations of the project allows us to see from a new angle the 1990s debates about literary canons which occurred simultaneously with Project Gutenberg’s most productive years.

Many thanks for your consideration.

            <Title>how I removed duplicates in ECCO-DSL</Title>
            <Text>Followed this tutorial using the “Gale Document Number”:
https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine#removing-duplicates
Removing duplicates

A second step is to detect and remove duplicates. These can be spotted by sorting them by a unique value, such as the Record ID (in this case we are assuming the Record ID should in fact be unique for each entry). The operation can be performed by clicking the triangle left of Record ID, then choosing ‘Sort‘… and selecting the ‘numbers’ bullet. In OpenRefine, sorting is only a visual aid, unless you make the reordering permanent. To do this, click the Sort menu that has just appeared at the top and choose ‘Reorder rows permanently’. If you forget to do this, you will get unpredictable results later in this tutorial.
Identical rows are now adjacent to each other. Next, blank the Record ID of rows that have the same Record ID as the row above them, marking them duplicates. To do this, click on the Record ID triangle, choose Edit cells &gt; Blank down. The status message tells you that 84 columns were affected (if you forgot to reorder rows permanently, you will get only 19; if so, undo the blank down operation in the ‘Undo/Redo’ tab and go back to the previous paragraph to make sure that rows are reordered and not simply sorted). Eliminate those rows by creating a facet on ‘blank cells’ in the Record ID column (‘Facet’ &gt; ‘Customized facets’ &gt; ‘Facet by blank’), selecting the 84 blank rows by clicking on ‘true’, and removing them using the ‘All’ triangle (‘Edit rows’ &gt; ‘Remove all matching rows’). Upon closing the facet, you see 75,727 unique rows.
Be aware that special caution is needed when eliminating duplicates. In the above mentioned step, we assume the dataset has a field with unique values, indicating that the entire row represents a duplicate. This is not necessarily the case, and great caution should be taken to manually verify whether the entire row represents a duplicate or not.

            <Title>DH2020 - "Women’s Writing in the Eighteenth Century: Evaluating ‘Representative’ Corpora"</Title>
            <Text>Women’s Writing in the Eighteenth Century: Evaluating ‘Representative’ Corpora

When we study literature through text mining, our conclusions are not based on an examination of “literature” itself, but on the corpus which is a sample or model of the imagined whole of “literature.” Despite the importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of text mining research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of corpora which re-create social inequalities.
As an eighteenth century scholar, I examine five corpora which are used as the basis of most eighteenth century distant reading: the English Short Title Catalogue database; Eighteenth Century Collections Online; the Eighteenth Century Collections Online  Text Creation Partnership; Project Gutenberg; and HathiTrust. I manually evaluate each corpus’s holdings for a narrow sample of texts, works published in England 1789-99, to investigate and contextualize their representation of female authors. For this eleven-year period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? 
In addition to calculating the gender ratio of authorship for each of the five corpora (including an assessment of the unsigned or unattributable works), I correlate gender with the basic categories of writing present in the corpus, to form more specific conclusions about the role of gender in corpus-building. Simple topic-modelling of the titles of eighteenth century works allows me to identify broad categories such as plays, poetry, pamphlets, novels, songs, sermons, ephemera, and so on. Titles in the eighteenth century are long, and served as advertisements, intentionally created to actively communicate this level of information about their works’ contents: although topic modelling of titles would not be sufficient in other centuries, it is remarkably effective here. Identifying the representation within each corpus of these categories of writing reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry in the smaller corpora.
This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller corpora. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of exclusion. Asking bibliographical questions of multiple corpora, in order to learn about the corpora themselves, emphasizes an under-examined stage of text mining research, and provides a basis for other scholars to use these corpora more precisely. Asking pointed questions about gender, in particular, may allow future users of these corpora to address some impacts of historical sexism.</Text>

            <Text>“16 In his discussion of JSTOR's "intolerably corrupt" OCR text, Nicholson Baker suggests that the reason why the user is prevented from scrolling through this naked OCR output is that scholars "might, after a few days, be dis- turbed by the frequency and strangeness of its mistakes . . . and they might no longer be willing to put their trust in the scholarly integrity of the database."17 Baker's criticism of JSTOR, however, is based on an error rate (with editorial intervention) of just one typo in every two thousand characters.” (Spedding 439)
“The two OCR-captured texts average over 150 typos per 2,000 characters,22 a high enough error rate to render parts of the text completely unintelligible. It is not clear how typical this error rate is, and how much it declines with editorial intervention,23 but again the scale of the problem is clear.24 Consequently, the claim that OCR errors "may occasionally result in incorrect character capture, which may affect some [ECCO] full-text search results," seems wildly, even heroically, optimistic.” (Spedding 440)</Text>

            <Title>ESTC: publishers visible over authors</Title>
            <Text>The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by “Great Britain”, and dwarfed again by the works by “null” authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.</Text>

            <Text>“Underlying these arguments is an intention to extend a transnational consciousness to data-rich literary history. With notable exceptions, there is a tendency in that field to treat large corpuses of American and British literature as a universal literary record. In exploring—and offering for exploration by others—a digitized body of works from around the world, published in the Australian colonies, I hope to disrupt the implicit national biases and globalizing impulses present in data-rich literary history.” (200)

“Most remarkably, this book shows an entirely new structure and organization for nineteenth-century Australian literary culture, one in which the metropolitan periodicals that have received almost all the critical attention emerge as less prolific, and less interconnected, in their publication of fiction than their neglected provincial counterparts. … To put the case bluntly, this book shows that Australian literary, book, and periodical scholars have been investigating colonial writing, publishing, and reading through a framework that obscures the major parts of it.” (201)

“These are simply some of the questions and approaches that I can think of. Equally important, if not far more so, to the future use of this scholarly edition are those questions and approaches I have not conceived. Such future research is possible because the meanings that this scholarly edition makes possible are not inherent in the curated Page 207 →dataset but emerge from interactions with it. Like a mass-digitized collection—or a scholarly edition of a literary work—the meanings of a scholarly edition of a literary system are produced transactionally. Those transactions are supported by the historical details Carol and I have accumulated regarding literary works and their documentary manifestations and are shaped by the organization of that information into uniform fields and hierarchical structures in accordance with both database form and my arguments about the nature and meaning of the literary system. But the outcomes of those inquiries are not predetermined: they exceed the detail and the form; they are unpredictable because they arise from a documentary record that is formed and reformed in the investigation of it. ” (206-7)

“I complete this book in the context of uncertainty in future government funding for Trove’s newspaper digitization program (Wynne).3 This situation carries distinct déjà vu. My last book, Reading by Numbers, offered a new history of the Australian novel by analyzing AustLit, the most extensive, online bibliography of a national literature then Page 208 →available. That book was finalized in the shadow of looming—later enacted—cuts to AustLit, and now I find myself in a similar position with Trove. This is despite the fact that Trove, as well as offering the largest collection of mass-digitized historical newspapers internationally, is vitally important to researchers and the Australian community and is recognized as world leading in how it presents and supports engagement with its holdings. It would seem that Australia has an unfortunate habit of creating world-leading digital humanities resources and then defunding them. Of course, this is not a uniquely Australian problem. As I write we face the possibility, for instance, that America’s National Endowment for the Humanities, and the multiple digital-knowledge infrastructure projects it supports, will be defunded. While I have sought to make the point that all collections—analog or digital—are selections, such funding cuts are depressingly pointed examples of why mass digitization is no magic solution to previous constraints on access to the documentary record.” (207-8)
“I raise the issue of funding not simply to protest present circumstances but to note their continuity with the past and to highlight the actions they require of literary historians for the future. While the prevailing discourse of crisis encourages a perception of the present as different from and worse than past times, the humanities have always been subject to the “real” world. Financial and other constraints have inevitably limited, and will always limit, which of an essentially infinite array of cultural objects can be collected, preserved, and transmitted. Rather than a reason to despair, this situation emphasizes the continuing importance of long-standing editorial and curatorial practices for the present and future of the humanities.” (208)
“Far from an esoteric preoccupation, textual scholarship has always been a response to real-world conditions and constraints: to the need to identify, understand, and manage gaps in the documentary record so as to provide an effective and explicit foundation for current and future interpretations and insights. Notwithstanding the influence of researchers such as Moretti and Jockers on academic and public perceptions of digital humanities, this space of mediation, collection, translation, and curation—of understanding and managing the constraints presented by the real world—is where much of the field actually sits. I offer the scholarly edition of a literary system as a contribution to this ongoing work: as a framework for enacting curatorial practices Page 209 →in the context of data-rich literary history and emerging digital, particularly mass-digitized, knowledge infrastructure and for extending insights gained through such practices to the broader discipline. In providing a rigorous and publicly accessible representation of how past literary works existed and interacted with one another—and with publishers, readers, and the world—and in offering arguments on that basis, I have sought to build on historical practices to enable and demonstrate the future of literary history. I have sought, in other words, to encounter the constraints of the real world, and to pursue knowledge not only despite, but with them.” (208-9)</Text>

            <Title>edition &amp; ideal copy</Title>
            <Text>One reason that it can be informative to close-read the data structures of a resource like the ESTC is that a resource’s categories of knowledge are driven by the uses to which it expects that knowledge to be put. Examining the implicit assumptions that will make a given organization of knowledge seem logical, we can work backwards to the purpose of mission of the initial knowledge creation. Thus Tabor describes the data structure and the mission of the ESTC in a single statement: “ESTC’s most basic bibliographical function is to provide, for each edition, a description of the ideal copy, meaning the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it” (369). Korshin further elaborates the use envisioned for this information: “the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book in his or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC” (211). Both “edition” and “ideal copy” are terms defined around the interests of a specialist audience of bibliographers, which bear inexact but important relationships to the formulation of an ESTC record.
An “edition” is a group of copies of a work which are understood to be interchangeable with each other (Tabor 369), though in practice different levels of granularity are applied in distinguishing between editions. The ESTC sometimes has separate entries for groups within an edition “when certain separately planned marketing units can be identified within the edition, such as reissues, imprint variants, and large versus regular-paper copies” (Tabor 369). Karian describes that “[s]ometimes the ESTC contains additional records if there are multiple states of an edition (a different state results from cancels or minor changes to the setting of type)” (289). Or, in “the later eighteenth century, when reprints from standing type became more common, ESTC cataloguers have occasionally granularized down to the level of individual impressions” (Tabor 369). As a result, Karian argues persuasively that ESTC records should not be treated as synonymous with “editions,” “issues,” or “titles,” since the same definitions of those boundaries may not be applied consistently. The specific question he poses is “What is the unit that the ESTC uses?” (289), and important question, to which the answer cannot really be “editions,” despite the best attempts of the ESTC bibliographers. Instead, he says “one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC” (Karian 289).
The “ideal copy,” too, represents an interpretation. Because the ESTC is essentially a movel based on limited samples of an imagined lost prior whole — “the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it,” as Tabor termed it (369) — a new sample can change the model. As Tabor describes, “[a]s additional reports of copies arrive, it may be that the ideal description must change in response. For instance, the existence of a half-title may only emerge on the evidence of the seventh copy reported. A half-title would then be added to the description of the ideal copy, and the six previously matched physical copies will receive notes recording that they are imperfect in this respect” (370). The ideal copy, like the database itself, thus represents a moving target.
</Text>
            <Comments>“Because ESTC is a bibliographical database rather than a catalogue, strictly speaking, its records describe groups of copies,” such as editions, “rather than specific copies,” such as the Exeter Book (Tabor 369).
“The first problem relates to the unit of classification. A clearly defined unit is necessary to ensure that a study of change over time is reliable and based on consistent terms. What is the unit that the ESTC uses? Scholars sometimes answer by using the terms “edition,” “issue,” or “title” interchangeably. But since the ESTC does not rely in a consistent manner on any of these terms for its unit of classification, one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC.” (Karian 289)</Comments>

For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book in his or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.” (Korshin 211)

            <Title>let's check for accuracy</Title>
            <Text>The existence of a carefully hand-corrected transcription of The Emigrants in ECCO-TCP provides an opportunity to check the reliability of the OCR in both ECCO and HathiTrust. I will proceed from the assumption that the ECCO-TCP files are 100% accurate, and that any differences between the OCR and ECCO-TCP represents an OCR error. Before beginning the experiment, my hypothesis was that both ECCO and HathiTrust would differ from each other in where and how they are inaccurate, but would have similar accuracy overall. I suspected that they were likely around 50% accurate, plus or minus 10% — I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worse, but would be quite surprised if their accuracy was 80% or higher. Acquiring the plaintext files from all three sources required some hunting for some hidden options and some workarounds; rendering them suitable for comparison required some modifications of each file, described more fully in Appendix B. Although Gale Digital Scholar Labs prominently provided an “OCR Confidence” of 95%, the first glance at the document was not very promising. To my surprise, Juxa calculated a relatively low “change index” for each text compared to the TCP witness: ECCO had a .16 change from base (i.e., 84% accuracy), and my normalized HathiTrust document had only a .09 change from base (i.e., 91% accuracy). This surprised me, and suggests that skepticism of OCR in eighteenth-century text mining may no longer be appropriate.</Text>
            <Comments>One exception to this assumption has to do with treatment of the character ſ, which the TCP file modernizes to an s, but which HathiTrust renders as ſ. To avoid penalizing HathiTrust for “inaccuracy” when it is actually a more accurate reproduction of the page than my reference point, I amended every instance of ſ in HathiTrust to an s.
What level of accuracy do people usually want for OCR research?
Leaving the ſ characters unchanged in the HathiTrust document resulted in a .29 change from base (71% accuracy), so my normalization of ſ to s had a major impact on the comparison. I consider the .09 result more appropriate than the .29 because the normalized copy better reflects how an OCR file would be used.</Comments>

            <Title>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study</Title>
            <Text>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history":
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."
It requires research and study, in order to identify and disentangle the many projects and effects within a work; we must know which parts to discard and which to nurture, to render something useful to ourselves, and we must know what exists for us to repurpose: this is why I study literature. And it requires instruction in order to allow students to get past, e.g., "I thought I was supposed to respect Mrs Bennet" to the literary riches within: this is why I teach literature.
(Literature, unlike history, is permitted artistic license.)
This constant re-translation allows us to continue conferring and experiencing value to the work of previous generations. I don't value the past or tradition simplistically, or for the virtue of merely being older; but we do not always have to reinvent the wheel, and seeing that things were different in the past can allow us to remember that they will be different in the future.
(Though I suppose, since I proceed on the assumption that it is not possible to perceive or understand the "now," I do often dismiss the contemporary as insufficiently informative to be getting on with.)</Text>

            <Text>Also in the category of smaller and specialized archives is Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly work — its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its use and utility. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard, ‘unscholarly’ source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. It narrows the field substantially to exclude works which have either ceased to be broadly interesting (as in the case of most forgotten fiction), or which were never particularly interesting (as in the case of almanacs and tax codes). Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but nonetheless an order of magnitude fewer than its more voracious potential competitors. And, like smaller specialized scholarly archives, Project Gutenberg has tailored its holdings to make it easy for readers to read, and quite difficult for its collection to be applied to any other use. By tailoring the structure of the archive itself to its specific materials, these collections are able to thoughtfully achieve their aims — but they also make it correspondingly difficult for users to achieve their own, different aims.</Text>

            <Title>WWO Robinson bio</Title>
            <Text>All written by Mary Mark Ockerbloom

“Her later poetical works included a second volume of Poems (1794); a sonnet sequence, Sappho and Phaeon (1796); and finally Lyrical Tales (1800). Mary Robinson frequently contributed poetry to the Morning Post, and eventually edited their poetry page. This increased her contact with the other poets and their work.” (WWO)
“More lucrative than Mary Robinson's poetry, was her prose. The money helped to support herself, her mother and daughter, and often Banastre Tarleton. Novels such as Vancenza (1792), The Widow (1794), Angelina (1796), and Walsingham (1797) went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror, their views could be related to the experiences of their author.” (Mark Ockerbloom)
“In both The False Friend (1799) and The Natural Daughter (1799) she responded to the defection of Banastre Tarleton. The death of his mother in 1797 catalyzed him to end his 15-year relationship with Mary.” (Mark Ockerbloom)
“She expressed her disillusionment with marriage in a work of social criticism, entitled A Letter to the Women of England, on the Injustice of Mental Subordination (1799). First published under the name of Anne Frances Randall, it reflected the thinking of her friends Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin. Mary argued for the choice of a wife to leave her husband, as she had done years before.” (Mark Ockerbloom)
“Mary Robinson also began to write her autobiography. However, her health became increasingly poor, and she died on December 26, 1800, leaving it unfinished. Her daughter Maria Elizabeth edited and published her memoirs (Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself, With Some Posthumous Pieces, 1801) and a collected edition of her Poetical Works (1806).” (Mark Ockerbloom)


“Mary Robinson appeared in her most famous (and infamous) role at age 21, a four-year veteran of the stage. Her success as Perdita in A Winter's Tale led to a royal request for a command performance. On December 3, 1779, the 17-year-old Prince of Wales (later King George IV) determined to make her his mistress. … Although the affair lasted less than a year, 'the Perdita' was notorious from then on; her gowns, her carriages, and her alliances became a constant source of discussion and speculation in the newspapers.” (WWO)
“The Prince's defection left Mary Robinson in a difficult position. Both the Robinsons were living on borrowed money, deeply in debt. She had ruined her reputation and given up a promising career as an actress, and received only promises in return. The Prince might have been expected to make some provision for his ex-mistress, but he did not. Her reputation already destroyed, Mary Robinson seems to have cared little about causing further scandal. She demanded £25,000 for the return of the prince's letters. She apparently settled for £5,000, paid by George III "to get my son out of this shameful scrape." It was enough to stave off her creditors. In 1782, Mary obtained a further £500 annuity for herself, and a £200 annuity during the life of Maria Elizabeth, in return for the surrender of the Prince's bond.
Lord Malden, the Prince's original emissary, was now Mary's most frequent companion, and her lover. Rumour also associated her with Charles James Fox, who negotiated the annuity settlement for her. So long as the men she associated with were attractive and attentive, she seemed willing to befriend them. (Thomas Robinson, though still alive, was uninvolved in her later life.)” (WWO)
“One night Lord Malden, Mary's 'protector', bet 1000 guineas that Mary would be true to him if Banastre Tarleton tried to seduce her. Several weeks later, Tarleton won both Mary's affections and the bet. Mary, when she learned what they had done, was furious with both men. Lord Malden, feeling himself betrayed when he had believed in her, rejected her. Tarleton seemed to care little for what happened. But after an accident in her phaeton, it was Banastre Tarleton who hurried to Mary's side - and she forgave him. Their seemingly unlikely relationship was to continue for the next 15 years.” (WWO)
“Tarleton's family viewed both extensive gambling and the notorious Perdita as dangers attendant upon London society. They offered to pay Banastre's most pressing debts of honour (more than they could readily afford) on the condition that he leave for the Continent - alone. Faced with social ruin otherwise, Tarleton set out for France on July 24, 1783. Mary desperately borrowed money for his debts, in hopes that he would stay in England, and set out in a post-chaise for Dover to intercept him. She was pregnant, and the rough travel caused a miscarriage. Mary suffered further injuries as a result of the incompetence of the midwife who attended her. Her legs became partially paralyzed, and she was affected by increasing paralysis and acutely painful rheumatism for the rest of her life.”
“The possibility of an election in the spring of 1784, brought Tarleton back to England to campaign in Liverpool. He moved in with Mary Robinson, and they plunged into the excitement of the campaign. However, Tarleton was not elected, and did not receive an appointment from those who were elected to power. Creditors began to gather once again: Mary's possessions were seized and auctioned off. She saved only the diamond-studded portrait of the Prince of Wales. When the Duc de Lauzun offered his hospitality in the fall of 1784, Ban and Mary quietly left for France.” (WWO)
“Tarleton and Robinson spent the next few years living intermittently in France and in Germany. They worked together composing and revising Tarleton's History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 (1787). Mary verified and augmented Banastre's memories of the campaigns, using letters, dispatches, and newspaper accounts. In 1787, Tarleton returned to London for the book's publication. It gained him some prestige, but little income. Fortunes were changing hands in gambling hells, so he and a partner opened a faro-bank in hopes of making theirs. Mary continued to write poetry, and was reportedly working on an opera. By the fall of 1787, her health had improved enough that she considered returning to England. Ban Tarleton went to Aix-la-Chapelle to meet her, and in 1788, Mary Robinson returned to England, settling at 42 Clarges Street. Tarleton lived just down the street, at number 30.” (WWO)
Though they experienced several breakups and reconciliations, which prompted Mary Robinson to write poems such as "Lines to Him Who Will Understand Them.", and the sonnet sequence Sappho and Phaeon , Mary Robinson's relationship with Tarleton continued until 1798. During that time, Banastre Tarleton pursued his interests in politics. He became a member of Parliament, and was promoted to Colonel and later General. During the same time, Mary Robinson wrote prolifically. Her poetry and fiction achieved considerable acclaim. (Her attempts at writing for the theatre were less successful.)</Text>

            <Title>ch 2 - mainstream press</Title>
            <Text>Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade.
One thread of inquiry is simply to recover contemporary printing practices: who was printing what, and when? What role do chapbooks and religious tracts play? Do our archives simply replicate the output of the major publishing houses?
 Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? If possible, I would also like to examine theatrical production through this framework. Given the heightened ephemerality of theatre, it seems likely that the re-staging of an older play will be even more interestingly shaped by its potential to provide a timely response to the context in which it is re-staged.
A second thread of inquiry shaped by this attention to mainstream print production is to examine celebrity via print culture. Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather that nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare how famous various literary celebrities were over the course of the decade. The technical challenge for this part of the project is to define a feasible and fruitful metric of celebrity. In addition to looking at various raw publication counts, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. I will also discuss popularity more generally: after developing a few different metrics for popularity, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? Why does one corpus show one popular thing, and another show another?</Text>

            <Title>18thC feeling</Title>
            <Text>Reading Feeling
My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional response, is this a healthy form of exercise for its audience’s moral feeling, or a weakening distraction from real moral action? These questions, in translated form, continue to shape my own questions about literature as a field: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor the importance of feeling without being misled by emotional manipulation?
The “major” works across the period are characterized by sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. My interest in the gothic and the supernatural is thus subsumed within a larger conversation about the representation of feeling. As Clery, Miles, and Gamer have explored in different ways, gothic and supernatural stories encompass a subset of literary strategies to understand and use feeling, which exist in conversation and competition with other strategies. Each work must strike its own balance between exciting the feelings of its readers, and moderating them. The simplest narrative tracing this development begins with a naive emotional philosophy of benevolence in sentimental novels, which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature.</Text>

            <Text>This provoked William Molyneux’s influential Case of Ireland (1698), which reached a tenth edition by 1782.11 Molyneux’s book was a protest against metropolitan policies, fashioned into a federal interpretation of the regal union. Ireland, he insisted, was equal in status to England, a ‘separate and distinct kingdom’ with its own supreme parliament, not subject to English jurisdiction. Although Molyneux’s book has sometimes been interpreted as a textbook of ‘colonial nationalism’, he was no modern ‘nationalist’, having no interest in cultural identity or in breaking the regal connection. As a member of the Protestant settler ‘Ascendancy’, he ignored the Catholic majority of Ireland, who did not begin to find their own patriot voice until the 1750s, in Charles O’Connor’s writings. Molyneux took for granted a common inheritance of ancestral English liberties ‘enjoyed under the crown of England for above five hundred years’. In fact, he was not necessarily averse to an incorporating union as a solution to Ireland’s unequal treatment, a union by which Irish members would be elected to an imperial parliament in London, provided that such a union would indeed bring full economic equality. This was a case more fully explored in Henry Maxwell’s Essay towards an Union of Ireland with England (1703). Much later, when the Irish parliament did achieve considerably greater autonomy, Molyneux’s remark in favour of full union was suppressed in the edition of his book published in 1782.

            <Title>db histories all about labour</Title>
            <Text>I contend that each database is best understood as a negotiation between the noncommercial values of textual reproduction and the commercial environment in which institutions much remain financially solvent. Each database has the goal of making valuable information available. After the 1990s, they are particularly influenced by the utopian ideal that digital reproduction at last made textual reproduction free. Each had to contend, however, with the fact that before a text can be reproduced digitally it must be created digitally, and that even if the material costs are entirely eliminated (which, of course, they are not) textual creation continues to have costs in labour. In Paddy Bullard’s “Digital Humanities and Electronic Resources in the Long Eighteenth Century,” which surveys the research completed and the resources used as of 2013, Bullard is also faced with the task of explaining why multiple services interact so poorly. Bullard, too, observes the core tension between public access vs private profit: 
Viewing the field of eighteenth-century digital humanities as a single prospect, it is the contrast between publicly funded, open-access sites, and privately owned, subscription-access resources that is most striking. Each side of the divide has much to learn from the other. Publicly funded academic projects must acquire the pragmatism and ambitiousness of scale that commercial developers have always shown. Commercial developers must adapt themselves more generously to the principles of scholarly openness and accuracy. They might also imitate the inventiveness of the open sector, its adaptability to the demands raised by different kinds of primary media. Both sides recognize the desirability of making their resources interoperable across the divide, and the business of interconnectivity will preoccupy all kinds of digital humanist in the coming decade. (756)
Bullard is correct to note that there are major disjunctions between databases like the The British Book Trade Index or careful online editions like The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674–1913, compared to massive archives like ECCO. It seems odd, however, to attribute to ECCO both “ambitiousness of scale” and “pragmatism” as the lessons for noncommercial projects to imitate, since an ambitious scale is only plausibly pragmatic for a project with the money to sustain itself. Even odder is the idea that commercial developers might voluntarily choose to “adapt themselves more generously to the principles of scholarly openness and accuracy,” when the core business model of a private enterprise relies on its lack of openness, and the private access only seems worth purchasing when its marketers suppress all nuance about accuracy. As Bode observes, “the commercial imperatives of these enterprises arguably depend on them presenting these collections as comprehensive” (Bode World 47). In other words, Bullard has observed an underlying system of profit and non-profit in awkward competition, and examined the outputs of these systems in order to articular their particular virtues and describe what a ‘best of both worlds’ might look like if both parts of the system sought to collaborate together on how best to achieve maximally useful scholarly resources. What Bullard overlooks in this process is that not all parts of this system have the goal of achieving maximally useful scholarly resources.</Text>

            <Text>“The critical apparatus for this curated dataset is composed of certain fields in the dataset that explain and justify decisions about derivation and attribution of these stories, as well as a historical introduction to the model’s parameters and principles, presented in chapter 3. “From World to Trove to Data: Tracing a History of Transmission” describes the history of transmission by which these nineteenth-century Australian newspapers were published, and subsequently collected and remediated, ultimately as digitized documents in Trove, and by which I identified the fiction they contain and represented it as bibliographical and textual data. In seeking to describe the translations and transformations, as well as the gaps and uncertainties, involved in this sequence, I foreground the fact that all collections—analog and digital, those we find and those we construct—have histories. These histories fundamentally determine access to the documentary record, in conjunction with the assumptions and arguments we bring to that inquiry.” (8)

Most of this chapter is describing her particular databases and sources, a useful model for me but not anything I will likely need to quote.

“[This chapter] elaborates the history of transmission outlined in figure 1, where each arrow signifies a process—in most cases, a series of processes—of selection, translation, and transformation of newspapers containing extended fiction, ultimately into bibliographical and textual data in the curated dataset. These processes are divided into three major sequences, explored successively in the chapter’s three parts. The first concerns the historical context for the literary system I explore, with the questions marks at the top of figure 1 indicating gaps in existing knowledge that this project was designed to address. What fiction was available to colonial newspaper readers? Where did it come from? And what does it indicate about colonial literary and reading cultures and the transnational circulation of fiction?
The chapter’s remaining sections describe two major sequences in the history of transmission of the documentary record. Section 2 considers the remediation of historical Australian newspapers as digitized documents in Trove and focuses on establishing the relationship between the newspapers in this collection and those that circulated in Australia in the nineteenth century. The final section explores the translation of parts of those digitized documents into bibliographical and textual data, explaining how I identified and harvested fiction in this mass-digitized collection, aspects of that method and of digitization that affected the outcome of this procedure, and the arguments manifested in the resulting data model. In articulating this history of transmission, including its omissions and concentrations, I aim to constitute the curated dataset as a viable foundation for literary history not by denying or concealing, but by demonstrating, its constructed and provisional nature.” (Bode 61)

“While manual indexing projects have enabled this history of Australian newspaper fiction, their usefulness is limited in respect to accessibility, interoperability, and scope. A number of projects are now only fully available as card indexes or are out of print. Where records have been collated and digitized, particularly by AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource, usually only Australian titles have been retained. Due to the sheer size of the archive, most previous studies have focused on major metropolitan newspapers. Accordingly, when scholars have addressed the questions highlighted in this chapter’s introduction—what was published, where was it from, and what does it say about colonial and transnational literary culture—their findings have often pertained to a selective handful of examples, generalized to the literary system broadly.” (Bode 66)
“Morrison recognized these problems in the late 1980s and proposed an “Index to Fiction in Australian (or Australasian?) Newspapers” as the solution. To conceptualize the index’s breadth, she conducted a “cross-sectional check” to explore which of the colony of Victoria’s hundred or so newspapers, “issued on or about 31 August 1889, contained instalments of novels.”15 Morrison’s cross-sectional analysis uncovered twenty-eight separate novels—some published multiple times—with a pattern of independent publication in metropolitan dailies and weeklies and syndicated publication in provincial newspapers. To gauge the proposed index’s depth, Morrison performed “a diachronic study of serials in the Age”—the major daily newspaper for Melbourne, Victoria’s capital city—“from April 1872 (when it began to Page 67 →serialise fiction) until the end of the century,” identifying sixty novels in this twenty-eight-year period, mostly by English or Scottish authors, with some American and Australian titles (“Retrieving” 29).16 In signaling its prevalence, Morrison’s survey highlights the importance of studying fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers at the same time as it demonstrates the practical impossibility of surveying the phenomenon using manual methods.” (Bode 66-7)

“Trove’s mass digitization of historical Australian newspapers provides an alternative to manually indexing fiction. But the significant possibilities this presents must be enacted with attention to the inevitable and complex ways in which collection and remediation (including digitization) translate and transform the documentary record. When using a mass-digitized collection or collections as the primary source for modeling a literary system, understanding the collection’s relationship to the historical context it appears to represent is essential. To what extent do the documents digitized reflect the scope, components, and features of historical records and contexts? The transparency and detail of Trove’s documentation of its newspaper digitization program help considerably in assessing such representativeness. But documentation does not supplant the need for critical analysis of the amplifications and exclusions created by collection and remediation: what Bonnie Mak calls providing an “archaeology of a mass-digitization.” (Bode 67)

She explicitly defines “the date I ceased harvesting fiction for this project (July 16, 2015)” (Bode 68)

“Size, of course, does not define a collection’s relationship to the works that circulated and were read at a particular time and place: a very large collection can be highly uneven or partial in its representation of a past literary system, just as a very small collection can be the opposite. Assessing a digital collection’s relationship to historical context requires investigating the analog holdings on which it is based and the subsequent selections and translations produced by digitization.” (Bode 68)

“Mass-digitization projects, particularly proprietary ones, are often opaque about the manner and outcomes of digitization. The British Newspaper Archive simply equates its digital collection with the British Library’s newspaper holdings, and those holdings with all historical newspapers.21 By contrast, Trove details the digitization process extensively.” (Bode 68)

“Trove’s documentation also explicitly acknowledges gaps between the historical newspapers that existed, the analog holdings of those newspapers, and the mass-digitized collection. In explaining the prioritization of certain newspapers over others, the selection criteria present digitization as selective. Although the ANDP, on at least one occasion, states its aim as complete digitization (“all Australian newspapers published prior to 1955”),27 the ANP lists newspapers for each state and territory that are known to have existed, but for which no records, or no records for substantial durations, are available in any format, including as many as 374 New South Wales titles.28 And in estimating the total number of historical Australian newspapers at 7,700 ,29 while also clearly indicating the number digitized, Trove signals the considerable gap between its digital holdings and the newspapers published.” (Bode 69)

She had a complete directory of all 19thC Australian newspapers for 3 specific years — comparing Trove to those shows that 28% of titles have been digitized. (Bode 70)
“For digital research generally, this low rate of coverage should underscore the partiality of other major mass-digitized historical newspaper collections.” (Bode 70)
“For my purposes, the proportional results above suggest that my analysis of Trove excludes around three-quarters of nineteenth-century Australian newspapers. Despite this substantial and important gap, based on further comparison of Trove’s holdings with historical newspaper records I feel confident describing the analyzed sample as broadly representative, albeit with areas of over- and under-representation.” (Bode 70)

“Research with the scholarly edition of extended fiction in colonial newspapers should proceed with awareness of these identified areas of overrepresentation: of newspapers from colonies with smaller populations and from earlier in the century and of metropolitan titles.” (Bode 72)

“searching digitized documents for designated words and phrases relies upon and tends to reinforce existing perceptions of collection contents. If I sought to identify fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers by searching for titles and authors I suspected were present, those are the only titles and authors I could find.” (Bode 73)
“To discover fiction in Trove’s nineteenth-century newspaper holdings in a way not reliant on prior assumptions I searched for specific words and phrases, but not in the contents of articles. Rather, I focused on identifying and employing search terms that recurred in the paratexts of fiction. … These formal features, intended to support and direct readers, can serve a similar function for automatically discovering digitized content.” (Bode 74)
Relies on the fact that Trove segments images into articles, rather than full pages, and humans manually correct the OCR for the title, subtitle, and first four lines of text. (75)
“This method also renders concrete the point, made in the abstract in chapter 2, that historical research with mass-digitized collections engages not with a preexisting record of the documentary past but with the effect of a sequence of transactions.” (Bode 75)

P 76: digital gaps also shaped by print and microfilm gaps

P. 77: mostly unaffected by OCR errors because she’s only looking at bibliographical metadata

“Due to the consistency of the newspaper paratext, with some experience, assessing the general presence of fiction in a batch simply involved scrolling through the returned CSV file.” (Bode 77) — human interpretation, though buried in a passive construction
A huge amount of manual checking involved!!!
“Even when the API returned a full title, it was usually necessary to access—and sometimes to read—the digitized article to see if it was fiction and, if so, whether it was a short story or continued across two or more issues. Even upon reading the text, deciding if it was fiction was not always straightforward. Colonial newspapers serialized writing in a Page 79 →range of genres (notably history, but also geography, geology, law, politics, and travel), and the boundaries between fiction and these nonfictional genres were not as clear as today. While fictional works frequently emphasized the moral meaning and accuracy of events depicted, the nonfictional genres above often employed discursive strategies (for instance, a first-person narrator or narrative tension) that today would largely be associated with fiction. Deciding which titles were fiction and which were not was done on a case-by-case basis.” (Bode 78-79)

“An editable interface was built onto MySQL storage using the open-source software Yii” (Bode 79)

“Yet despite this general correspondence between the findings of earlier studies and the fiction discovered in this project, the account that follows differs—often radically—from the existing narrative and overturns multiple current conceptions of the influences—literary, institutional, social, political, and economic—shaping colonial literary culture and the global circulation of fiction in this period. That challenge to existing arguments is not based on access to a supposedly objective, unmediated, or comprehensive record of fiction. As this chapter demonstrates, the curated dataset on which the arguments in the second part of this book are grounded is itself an argument about nineteenth-century Australian newspaper fiction. That argument is made in the context of, and profoundly shaped by, a complex history of transmission: from the newspapers that operated in the colonies, to the documents collected, microfilmed, and digitized by the NLA, to the understanding of fiction expressed in harvesting and curating the bibliographical data. In tracing this history—including the omissions, transactions, and transformations it involves—I have sought to expose the constructed and conditional nature of the curated dataset: not in order to discount but to establish its capacity to stand as a reliable foundation for my own literary-historical arguments, and for those of others.” (Bode 81)

“I adapt the scholarly edition to the modeling of literary systems, offering in chapter 3 a historical introduction to a curated dataset of over 9,200 works of extended fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers. That chapter elaborates the history of transmission constitutivePage 204 → of that data, explaining as much as possible the remediations, transformations, and omissions involved in the transition from the nineteenth-century newspapers that were published, circulated, and read in the Australian colonies, to their collection and curation, ultimately as digital objects in Trove, to the discovery and representation of the fiction they published. Available alongside this book as a downloadable dataset from the University of Michigan Press, and as a searchable, browsable, and wholly or partially exportable database through the Australian National University’s Centre for Digital Humanities Research, this curated dataset embodies an argument about how literary works existed and interrelated in the past. With additional critical apparatus detailing specific data constructions, it offers a rigorous and reliable basis for the discoveries and arguments I present. It has this capacity not because it is comprehensive or true but because its incompleteness and conditionality have been acknowledged and investigated.” (203-4)</Text>

            <Text>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THIS INFORMATION? Lauren Klein’s paper at MLA 2018, “Distant Reading after Moretti,” in fact poses the turn away from Moretti as an urgent imperative: “what do we do about distant reading, now that we know that Franco Moretti, the man who coined the phrase ‘distant reading,’ and who remains its most famous exemplar, is among the men named as a result of the #MeToo movement” \cite{Klein:2018to}? Klein, drawing on Sara Ahmed’s observation that “sexual harassment is a structural, as well as personal problem,” draws together critiques of distant reading’s exclusion of women in terms of its “issues of representation in the field,” its “unduly masculinized rhetorical positioning,” its “failure to engage with the conceptual issues that relate to women,” and the “actual computational models of gender that are often deployed” \cite{Klein:2018to}. All of these critiques of distant reading, Klein argues, show that “it’s not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading can’t do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so” \cite{Klein:2018to}</Text>

Through the collection and curation of our own dataset we are acutely aware of the choices that went into its creation. The use of already curated datasets has other undeniable advantages: it may temper the influence of the researcher on his or her findings; furthermore, from a practical standpoint, it allows work to advance past the time-consuming labor of curation. While we would not suggest that researchers need to reinvent the wheel, we do advocate for a more explicit reflection on the relationship between the dataset and the objects it describes.

            <Text>“However, the path to digitization was not ideal: these documents were imaged in the late 1970s, transformed into microfilm during the 1980s, and the microfilms digitized in the 1990s. Because of the state of reproductive technologies during the late 20th century, as well as the circuitous path to digitization (through microfilm), the image quality is very poor and bitonal, with no greyscale / images available. Furthermore, the original documents themselves, printed with premodern technologies, pose problems even for human readers of their pages, but much more so for optical character recognition (OCR) engines. For example, printed characters were not perfectly situated on a baseline, blackletter fonts were used, ink bled through the paper, and the typeface was broken and overworn.” (Christy et al. 1-2)
Reference “deep fried memes” — xkcd comic: https://xkcd.com/1683/

The punchline of this comic strip is a classic “form vs content” joke: the literal words relay a techno-optimism that is undercut by the visual decay of the image itself, which is meant to remind the comic’s audience of current state of older comics or memes that circulate on the internet. The first two panels are merely low-resolution, reflecting purely technological trends of digital data loss. Even without data loss, an old image is likely to look damaged in a modern context, as standards for “high resolution” have climbed with every year; at one time, it was pointless to save any digital image at higher resolution than 72dpi, since 72dpi was the maximum a screen could display. Today, Apple’s Retina displays commonly show 227dpi, and mobile phones go up to 500dpi. A perfectly unaltered 72dpi image from twenty years ago can easily look blurry and out of place on a modern website. As another way that the ordinary passage of time degrades digital images: although it is possible for bits to be copied exactly (as the comic’s main character says), in reality most image files are compressed, uncompressed, and recompressed as they are shared between computers, especially if they are uploaded to and downloaded from websites which want to minimize their hosting costs. It would be almost impossible for time and technology to continue changing, developing new standards and formats, without older images becoming degraded through multiple conversions — and therefore suffering in comparison to newer images.
The second two panels of the comic, however, draw attention to distinctly social human processes which often accelerate the decay of digital images. In the third panel, the stick figures have slightly shrunk, and beneath them we can see some icons of a computer menu. Implied in this panel is the idea that we are no longer looking at a copy of the image file itself, but a screenshot someone has taken of the image open on their computer. The final panel adds another layer of screenshotting through the mobile phone menu at the top, and two different watermarks implying that the image has been reposted at several image-sharing websites. The relevant lesson here is: [???]
The inevitability of digital decay has been acknowledged in informal cultural circles online, such as this website, and the wider phenomenon of “deep fried memes,” which present images (conventionally, established meme formats for other memes) with hyperbolic distortions. Pixellation, colour shifts, and layers of emoji (which, like the watermarks in the last panel of the xkcd comic, imply human intervention and not just technological deterioration) all contribute to a visual effect that makes the images “look like they've been compressed, re-uploaded, and compressed again,” implying an often incongruous long history for the content of theimage, and creating an overall effect of being “comically over-processed” (Matsakis).</Text>

Problem: in the “initials” column one of them was identified as Mrs, should have been caught as female

Decisions:
Small m I interpreted as meaning “monsieur” eg m. Berquin (Arnaud)
St. John, Theophs. J. I decided was male
Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (m)
Beilby Porteus (m)
Lindley Murray (m)
Elhanan Winchester  (m)
Bion, of Phlossa near Smyrna (m)
Sibley, Manoah (m)
Trophime-Gérard, marquis de Lally-Tollendal (m)
Hayman Rooke (m)
Jesse Foot (m)
Walley Chamberlain Oulton (m)
Marsom: title page actually says John Marsom, so male

            <Text>The structuring principle of Project Gutenberg is its missions to make books available for pleasure reading. I argue that its core concept, analogous to the “edition” in the ESTC, or the “book” in ECCO and HathiTrust, is the “story.” Many of the priorities of Project Gutenberg which seem incompatible with scholarly approaches to textual history are explained by thinking of Project Gutenberg as being structured around “stories” rather than “books.”

“At the end of 1993, Project Gutenberg's eTexts were organized into three main sections: a) "Light Literature", such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Peter Pan or Aesop's Fables; b) "Heavy Literature", such as the Bible, Shakespeare's works or Moby Dick; c) "Reference Literature", such as Roget's Thesaurus, and a set of encyclopaedias and dictionaries. This organization in three sections was abandoned later for a more detailed classification.” (Lebert)</Text>

            <Title>ECCO - MARC</Title>
            <Text>My first source of ECCO metadata consisted of MARC records, kindly provided by University of Toronto libraries (my thanks to Leslie Barnes!). I requested information for all works published 1789-99 in the UK (so, including Ireland and Scotland, but excluding America.) Later I changed my mind and didn’t want Ireland and Scotland any more, which created a problem for myself.
My ECCO metadata presented particular challenges. I had access to MARC records, which stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue. At several points, I read this data with my feeble non-machine eyes in order to guide my data processing.
Using MarcEdit, I converted these MARC records to csv files which could, in OpenRefine, be read, manipulated, and merged like my other corpora. Since I was not able to simply convert “all the MARC headings that exist” using MarcEdit, I used all numbers 1 to 999 and [will] delete empty columns. I frequently referred to the Library of Congress’s MARC info at “MARC 21 Format for Authority Data.” Cataloger's Reference Shelf, The Library Corporation. However, ECCO encodes much of its data in “unassigned” columns, rather than the standardized LOC categories, presenting some challenged.

These MARC records came in four files, named ECCO.mrc, ECCO1.mrc, ECCO2.mrc, and ECCO2-A.mrc. For some internal clarity I renamed the “ECCO.mrc” file to “ECCO0.mrc”. </Text>

            <Title>TCP public / private</Title>
            <Text>Two questions in the FAQ, “Why would I buy something that is achievable only if others do the same?” and “Why would I buy something that is going to become freely available?” taken together imply the speculative and ambitious nature of the original project. In the official answers provided to these evidently frequently asked questions, there is a sense that the project posed a prisoner’s dilemma: every individual institution’s “best” move, from a game theory perspective, was to contribute nothing to the project and then reap the benefits of everyone else’s work, but if every institution did so, then no one would benefit. A close reading of both responses illuminates an interesting tension in values:
Why would I buy something that is achievable only if others do the same?
Mere calculation may have disinclined some libraries from joining. TCP partnership was always less a purchase than an (admittedly risky) investment, since all of Michigan’s projections for the TCP corpus depended on a certain optimistic assumptions about how many other institutions would join.  Some libraries may have joined out of faith in Michigan’s track record, or because of a long-standing connection with the University or its staff. Some out of an idealistic belief in the collaborative model that TCP represented or in the public value of the product it promised. Some perhaps out of a cost-benefit risk estimate. For all the partner libraries, however, TCP membership was in effect a commitment to fellow libraries to share the burden and reward of this work. Partner libraries contributed to the cost of producing tens of thousands of painstakingly produced electronic editions of early English works. Each new library that joined made it possible for the project to key books that we otherwise would not, improving the corpus for everyone.
Why would I buy something that is going to become freely available?
This question too has no obvious answer that will please everyone, and indeed this question may have influenced some potential partners to refrain from joining. The structure of the TCP, with its provisions for exclusive access for a time, followed by public release, was something of a balancing act, designed to encourage membership by both those who were unwilling to wait ten years or so for access to the texts on behalf of their students and faculty, and those who believed in the creation of an unrestricted public resource and were willing on altruistic grounds to contribute to it.  Regardless of their motives for joining, the success of the EEBO-TCP depended on the support of partner institutions. The partnership fee directly funded the conversion of new books,  and greatly affected the rate at which the work was carried out. By joining up,  a library not only gained immediate access to the texts,  and not only contributed to making a larger, more comprehensive corpus for everyone, but also measurably affected the pace, and advanced the completion date, of the project–and thereby advanced the date at which  the texts would be released to the public.
The answers weakly attempt to provide the game-theory argument, but also carry the sense that the true answer, which they would like to give, has nothing to do with game theory and rationality, and everything to do with transcendent values of scholarship itself. In the minutes to the 2001 meeting of their executive board, they open with: “the project should determine more clearly if it is ‘a partnership or a product.’ Comment was offered that it is a ‘partnership to create a product’” (TCP Executive Board, 2001)

The 2003 meeting minutes concluded with the observation that “considering where it was even two years ago, it is stunning to think that EEBO-TCP now produces texts comparable to any commercial product in a very cost-effective way. It was agreed that the TCP concept is on the cusp of revolutionary changes in research and teaching and that it will continue to grow and extend the foundation which the project has built.” (Meeting Minutes 2003-10-22.) (These minutes also talk a lot about spending, and about how to sell EEBO and TCP.)

In the 2004 minutes: “Since the TCP has evolved from one project in cooperation with ProQuest to now three projects in cooperation with three different commercial publishers, it is useful to consider how the Board might adapt to accommodate the changing situation. … The representatives of the three companies began the discussion by highlighting the things they would feel uncomfortable revealing in front of their competitors. These included pricing, their contributions to the TCP, and general marketing strategy. It was agreed that the Board should attempt to structure its meetings so that all members could be present and, if at some point there was a need to divulge sensitive information, the Board could hold an executive session in which that could be discussed.”</Text>

Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain)” (Behrendt 201).

            <Text>This dissertation is concerned with the process by which texts do or don’t ‘enter’ into ‘canons’ of writings, particularly in [the context of digital resources which present themselves as alternatives to canons]. My ‘case study’ is the writing published in England between 1789 and 1799, [A PERIOD THAT IS RELEVANT TO MY QUESTION]. I say “writing” and not “literature,” despite the fact that my central interest is literature, because I address works whose status as “literary” is contested. I also say “published” rather than “written,” because I address the “1790s-ness” of works written well before this decade, but which took on new and timely meanings when reprinted.
The other “great unread” that even distant reading doesn’t read: the things that aren’t in corpora.

In service of this goal, this dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like. It also seeks to explain, in equally minute detail, why this task of ‘objective’ historical recovery is, in fact, impossible. In the process, I show how our persistently perplexing questions about canons can be asked, and answered, in new ways with digital tools. Computational methods, in their close association with ‘big data’, are often advertised as the solution to the problems of scale which are presumed to motivate the formation of selective canons. As my own computational experimentation will reveal, however, computational study more commonly undertakes the same judgment and valuation of texts that characterizes ‘canon formation,’ and displaces this process onto ‘corpus building.’ It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia. Accordingly, this dissertation takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the major computational experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.</Text>

            <Text>Bode and Underwood are both doing ‘big DH’; Underwood with full texts (representing perhaps the DH ‘norm’), Bode essentially with bibliographic metadata, as I would like to do. Bode demonstrates that there is an untapped world here. One of the weaknesses of Underwood, and most other DH work, is that conclusions get dramatically unreliable before around 1830. Oddly, much older works are in some ways more accessible, via eg EEBO or the DOE. Improvements in OCR might improve 18thC full texts, though this is only useful if suitable underlying books are scanned — because 18thC books are more precious, they are less scanned (you need to have something to OCR).

I think a big question has to be: what was the role of women in the print world of the 1790s?

            <Text>“I came to learn that women have never had a history or culture of leisure. (Unless you were a nun, one researcher later told me.) That from the dawn of humanity, high status men, removed from the drudge work of life, have enjoyed long, uninterrupted hours of leisure. And in that time, they created art, philosophy, literature, they made scientific discoveries and sank into what psychologists call the peak human experience of flow. Women aren’t expected to flow. I read feminist leisure research (who knew such a thing existed?) and international studies that found women around the globe felt that they didn’t deserve leisure time. It felt too selfish. Instead, they felt they had to earn time to themselves by getting to the end of a very long To Do list. Which, let’s face it, never ends. I began to realise that time is power. That time is a feminist issue.”

            <Text>Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.</Text>

            <Text>First experiment: identify gender make-up of databases. (Write a program in R)

Bio: Lawrence Evalyn is a Ph.D. Candidate in English at the University of Toronto, specializing in computational approaches to eighteenth century literature.

Abstract: This paper will examine how contemporary digital databases of eighteenth century literature have remediated the cultural production of the 1790s through choices of which texts to make digitally accessible. Despite the importance of corpus-building (that is, the accumulation of a large body of text files for analysis) to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. My research studies literature of the 1790s, a time when literary canons were being reinvented in England, to examine processes of selection in the eighteenth century and today. For the decade 1789-99, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts — the source for most distant reading research on eighteenth century literature — includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? I have written a program which infers a gender for the named authors of the works recorded in three major eighteenth century databases. (As my paper will discuss, inferring a gender from a name would not be tenable for a modern literary corpus, but is not inappropriate for the strong emphasis on binary gender in eighteenth century title pages.) By comparing the gender representation within different digital resources, I present a case study in recognizing the inequalities which may underly apparently neutral research resources.</Text>

            <Text>In my fourth chapter, I playfully attempt what might be considered a devil’s advocate method of textual selection: pure random sampling. Using a random number generator, I select arbitrary texts to close read, and weave together a narrative of 1790s print from their contents. Much of my work will involve defining and justifying the parameters for my random selection — ESTC, or a full-text database? How many texts? From which years? — but once I have taken my sample, I will not re-sample. For each text, I explore the path which brought it into the databases in question, and what scholarship (if any) might be used to interpret it. How far afield do I have to look, to find scholarly conversations addressing each text? What, if anything, can be produced by placing them in conversation? This methodology is inspired by work in the field of speculative computing, a practice of creating strange and possibly non-functional programs in order to generate productive forms of surprise.</Text>

            <Text>Eliot's "devaluation of Milton along with major Romantic and Victorian poets, and his revaluation of the seventeenth-century ‘metaphysical' poets" -- 
"Eliot's canonical reformation remains significant for having enabled... the most important new literary pedagogies in the first half of the twentieth century, the first associated with the name of F.R. Leavis and /Scrutiny/, the second with the New Criticism. Despite the real differences between the more or less explicitly 'ideological' tenets of these movements -- Leavis's progressive by anti-Marxist critique of modernity, the New Critics' conservative advocacy of Christian ‘agrarian' values -- both set out from the same revisionist judgments about English literary history, for which the authority of Eliot as critical arbiter was constantly evoked." (134)
even though Leavis and New Critics had different ideological values, they could agree on canon reassessment because "the two movements could be seen to provide different solutions to the same social or cultural problems.” (135)
"the revaluation of vernacular works in English as the equivalent of the Greek and Roman classics provided the emergent bourgeoisie with a means of emulating the cultural capital of the aristocratic and clerical estates. The project of installing a 'literary sensibility' in the largest possible constituency was on the contrary intended to have the social function of neutralizing the very political ideologies which set the classes in opposition to one another. The literary sensibility was to unify the nation culturally just as Standard English was supposed to unify it linguistically.” (136)
"all ideology aspires to the condition of doxa" but instead encounters orthodoxy and heterodoxy ... “not even feudal culture managed to establish Christianity as a doxa, else there would have been no heresy in the Middle Ages” (137)
"As a historical substitute for doxa, however, literature seems to stand in a relation of orthodoxy to beliefs that / are no longer dominant, that is, literature stands as a testament to the absence of doxa.” (137-8)
"Or... literature itself can be installed as a sensibility that performs the social function of doxa— producing a state of cultural homogeneity, or unquestioned belief-- without ever requiring the 'imperfect' supplement of orthodoxy, without specifying directly what these beliefs are. Precisely because sensibility is not the same thing as belief, it is never subject to decay into mere orthodoxy." (138)
"literary culture and its institutions... so far from establishing a cultural doxa for the social order as a whole, or even establishing a potent ‘orthodoxy' on the basis of the literary canon, remained culturally /marginal/ to the social formation of modernity." (139)
Leavis's way of valuing a work relied on its heterodoxy: thus institutionalizing it in schools removed the grounds of its critique (140)
New Critics were the opposite -- wanted literature to support orthodoxy that could replace the church, without uni becoming church; treated orthodoxy as something covert to be discovered (140)
Leavis sees judgment as the role of the critics; New Critics see it as interpretation (which works very very hard to find exactly what it wants to find) (141)
"we shall have to examine first Eliot's systematic valorization of minor poetry, and then Cleanth Brooks's transformation of that evaluative principle into a technique of interpretation" (141)
for Eliot, “in the most desirable of historical circumstances, the individual poet has less and less to do, the form more and more. Ideally all poets are minor in a world of major form." (146)
Eliot's valorization of "minor" poets has the same problem of paradox as an embrace of "noncanonical" authors (147)
“the appearance in Eliot's criticism of a shadowy, alternative 'tradition' of minor poets has a good deal to do with the legitimation of his poetic practice, with the emergence ... of a 'modernist' poetic." (147)
Eliot wants to establish Christianity as a doxa -- “Eliot would like to see ‘Christian faith' as enabling poetic production in general. This conviction is responsible for his tendency to backdate his own religious inclinations, and thus to dispute the reading of /The Waste Land/ in which it stands as a modernist document of ‘disillusion.’” (150)
Eliot: “‘The continuity of literature is essential to its greatness; it is very largely the function of secondary writers to preserve this continuity, and to provide a body of writing which is not necessarily read by posterity, but which plays a great part in forming the link between / those writers who continue to be read.’ Such statements, as usual, empty out the category of majority on behalf of a claim for the more essential cultural function of minor writers.” (151-152)
"The tendency of Eliot's later criticism is finally to identify 'tradition' with 'orthodoxy’" (152)
Eliot's fantasy is that literary figures / literary culture can produce the social order / culture at large (152)
literary culture as partial substitution for clergy, semi-unsuccessful, esp as “The decline of the public sphere in the nineteenth century transforms the agents of literary culture into exclusively traditional intellectuals who nevertheless continue to imagine their relation to the social order as organic on the clerical model” -- literary institutional hierarchies follow clerical model (153)
"The sense in which most criticism remains, as Edward Said has argued, 'religious criticism,' is by no means simple or easy to explain, because the element of the 'religious' occupies a realm of social fantasy, which yet testifies to a certain reality about literary culture." (154)
"the social inhibition that disallows literary culture from making doctrinal claims of the 'orthodox’ sort drives these claims back into the refuge of literary form." (155)
“the emergencce of the ‘literary critic' within the generalist faction did not imply a simple repudiation of the disciplinary style of the philologist, but rather the development of a more or less rigorous countermethodology of 'interpretation' which could be put in service of ‘Generalist' aims, the aims of cultural criticism." (155)
"Eliot's narrative of English literary history as the story of a split between an orthodox minor tradition and a heterodox major line is thus displaced into allegorical explications of the 'internal structures' of the canonical texts, which all exhibit the features of paradox, irony, or ambiguity formerly attributed specifically to the metaphysicals and the moderns.” (157)
Well Wrought Urn: “If that text discovers that all canonical literature (or literature per se) speaks the 'language of paradox,’ it still reads paradox as the evidence of a 'unity of experience' no longer available to dissociated moderns, though we moderns may continue to contemplate what we have lost in the experience of the literary artifact." (157)
“doxa (what is unquestioned, impensé) and what is openly advocated, an ‘orthodoxy.’” (157)
hidden depth / revelation / centrality of the seemingly minor -- rhetoric of criticism (158)
heresy of paraphrase (158)
poetry's form as battling science, which is to blame for the dissociativeness of modernity (159)
interpretation as also a powerful alternative to science (159)
because poems achieve paradox, they don't mean what they say they mean (159)
Cleanth Brooks' approach was to look for similarities between "masterpieces" rather than historical differences, and esp similarity between "masterpieces" and metaphysicals and moderns (160)
Brooks is competing against philologists. “The school becomes the site at which the practice of reading can be cultivated in such a way as to preserve the cultural capital of literature (signified in the Brooksian allegory as a kind of /sacredness/), just because its social space can be conceived as a space of deliberate and strategic withdrawal, as the withdrawal of literary culture from 'the world’” (165)
“It remains to be seen whether the retreat of literary culture to the university was really strategic." (167)
New Critical close reading pedagogy was useful in mass educating university students who don't already have elite historical knowledge -- but it wasn't intended to be (168)
“One may... say that difficulty itself was positively valued in New Critical practice, that it was a form of cultural capital, just by virtue of imparting to cultural objects a certain kind of /rarity/, the very difficulty of apprehending them." (168)
“The revaluation of difficulty on behalf of both metaphysicals and moderns is a consistent objective of /The Well Wrought Urn/" (169)
Brooks has to make the established literary curriculum seem difficult, in order to show that all poetry is inherently difficult, in order to show that modernist poetry is justified in being difficult (170)
1920s and 30s taught a bunch contemporary poets I don't know as *modern* poets, *because* they accessibly expressed positive identification with their contemporary culture (170)
"the very existence of a ‘popular' literary modernism testified to a temporary blurring of the cultural capital embodied by literature and by the artifacts of mass culture. Hence the anthologies of the period... included as representative modern poems... works which it is difficult to regard not as anything other than kitsch, perhaps the least interesting ‘popular' artifacts of the twentieth century." (171)
the successful distribution of Standard English (via literature) at lower levels of schooling left no way to distinguish higher levels of schooling: hence the need to revalue difficulty (171)
“the valuation of difficulty in New Critical practice never had to be expressed, and could not be expressed, as the devaluation of Standard English itself" (172) even though difficulty served the function of being more valuable than simple standard english
“In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, these new students also discovered at the sae moment why it needed to be studied /in the university/“ (172)
“Literature... presents a united front, in the form of its intrinsic /difficulty/, against the artifacts of mass culture” (173)
“Therein lies the peculiar power of mass culture, since the waning cultural centrality of literary works in the face of new mass cultural forms never entailed a denial of the nominally superior value of literature” -- readers of mass media “would no doubt have concede the cultural superiority of literature, whether or not [they] ever felt inclined to read any works so designated" (173)
In 1976 4th ed of Understanding Poetry, Donne's "The Canonization" “is contrasted not with secular, scientific culture, its antagonist in The Well Wrought Urn” but with a popular song from the 1920s (173)
“the mass culture of modernity never coveted the institutional space to which literary culture retreated" -- uni students dutifully studied &amp; accepted the value of literature but “continued to consume both kinds of artifacts in the distinct spheres of their consumption" (174)
“The capacity to experience the social space of the schools and the social space of mass culture as disjunct effectively institutionalized two modes of consumption, one consequence of which was to make literary works more difficult to consume outside the school." (174)
alludes lightly to the fact that "mass culture can be stigmatized by association with the lurid taste of the female consumer” (175)
Brooks praises older literature for its ability to inhabit ambiguity, but “When the choice is between literary culture and mass culture, however, there is no question of 'both-and.’ ... [but] neither the polemic against secularity nor the polemic on behalf of Eliot's canonical choices proved capable of imposing Brooks's ‘either-or’ upon the generation of postwar readers. The effect of New Critical pedagogy was rather to produce a kind of recusant literary culture, at once faithful to the quasi-sacred authority of literature but paying tribute at the same time to the secular authority of a derogated mass culture. For the recusants the artifact of mass culture might be consumed with a certain guilt, or a certain relief; but for those whose allegiance was sworn to secular authority, that culture provided everything there was to consume." (175)

Footnotes
7 “A particular passage of Eliot's is worth noting in "What Is a Classic?" opp: "The predecessors should be themselves great and honoured: but their accomplish- ment must be such as to suggest still undeveloped resources of the language, and not such as to oppress the younger writers with the fear that everything that can be done has been done, in their language” (58).” (369)
“Another consequence, which may have been equally serious, was that literary education relieved one of the necessity of "reading" mass cultural artifacts. If the refusal of reading (that is, of interpretation) in the domain of mass culture no longer has the excuse it once had, it has not been without considerable resistance that in- terpretation has been wrested from its privilege as the High Cultural mode of con- sumption. Witness the struggle of Film Studies to establish its legitimacy in the university.”  (370) — by which he means that the existence of literature as the site for interpretation/criticism frees mass culture from interpretation/criticism, to the extent that it was difficult for film studies to establish its right to conduct interpretation (or more recently, video game studies)</Text>

            <Text>Writing Timeliness
Whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand, texts take on shifting meanings as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and recontextualized over time. The changing impact of works over time is most obvious in overtly political works like Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, whose relationship with, for example, Helen Maria Williams’ Letters from France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men was directly determined by the extent to which the works in question were considered to have been borne out by political events. But time-sensitive readings, and an expected textual responsiveness for current events, extended to to literary works as well.
Novels which, in scholarly editions, give the illusion of being singular, unified objects are nearly all the result of a more complicated and responsive process of coming into being. As Tristram Shandy was composed and published, for example, each new installment slightly shifted its emphasis, so that the emerging narrative only gradually solidified into what are, in retrospect, its major concerns. Particularly notable is the way that volumes 7 through 9 of Tristram Shandy, written after the publication of The Castle of Otranto, incorporate Gothic materials differently than the earlier volumes; rather than being one text with one interpretation of the role of the supernatural in heightening readerly emotion, Shandy was a phenomenon which unfolded and varied over time. Even works which were not printed in installments, like Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and Walter Scott’s Waverley, could change in content and in popular reception with a new edition.
Similarly, Lyrical Ballads is often studied in the context of its 1798, 1800, and 1802 editions, but William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge seem to have been following standard poetic practice by writing new prefaces, selecting new poems, and re-editing their works for a new emphasis. Charlotte Smith enacts similar changes across the dozen editions of Elegiac Sonnets printed between 1784 and 1812. Smith’s 1797 edition, for example, includes a new preface, re-selects the non-sonnet poems, and adds new sonnets to create a “new” work out of poems which were as many as thirteen years old. The edition presents her as a politically engaged poet, directly relevant to the events of her day, whose radical philosophies are salient even in her earliest sonnets.</Text>

Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts. Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.</Text>

“Kirwan praises Ward Elliot and Robert Valenza’s “call for acknowledgement of uncertainty (a productive agnosticism rather than a reactionary atheism or unquestioning faith),” concluding the section with the dictum that “critics should be as willing to lose Shakespeare as to find him””
“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””
“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha. In so doing, Kirwan proposes to continue destabilizing the monolithic “Shakespeare,” a project he traces back two decades.”
“a startlingly diffuse, unexpectedly consistent corpus of plays linked by company ownership, rather than by what he argues is the anachronism of authorial ownership.
Motivated to trouble “post-Romantic ideals of individual authorship””
“Boldly, he offers agnosticism to replace the “did-didn’t binary.” This yields “the possibility of Shakespeare’s contribution” to Locrine (137) or a proposed differentiation between “Shakespearean” and “by Shakespeare” (161). This third chapter may inflame more controversy than anything else in the book.”
“the field of attribution studies desperately needs critical metacognitive appraisals of its methods, its successes, and its failures. Kirwan’s assessment of and engagement with attribution studies ought to be cited for years to come”
“Having proven the constructedness of “Canon” and “Apocrypha,” having demonstrated the viability of collaboratively created drama, and having questioned the use and availability of “certain” attributions, Kirwan performs his crowning disruption—to “redefine the meanings of both ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘complete’ in a bid to offer multiple configurations of canon” (205). Here and throughout, Kirwan affirms canons, not a Canon.”
“Kirwan’s final chapter models alternative canon-writing practices as evidence of the potentiality of multivalent canons “to provide options instead of answers” dependent upon audiences’ critical participation”</Text>

            <Text>The original corpus came from the ESTC, giving all records that matched the query of country=enk and years=1789-99.

However, this still included some results which were not what I wanted.
Many years, for example, were in fact attributed as ranges — such as the very vague “1700-1799.” The ESTC provided a “regularized” year which dated works to the earliest year in its possible range, so that “1700-1799” was parsed as “1700.” I decided to proceed onward with their assumption that texts appeared at the earliest plausible date, and thus removed any titles whose regularized years were prior to 1789. I used OpenRefine to make a “facet” based on years, and manually removed each year that wasn’t 1789-99.
Before removing these years, I had 51,860 rows.
Afterward, I had 51,407 rows, so 453 titles were only dubiously 90s titles.

From these 51,407 rows, then I set about removing titles that didn’t list England as at least one of their places of publication. I used a text filter, inverted, to find all rows which didn’t include “England” in their “Place of Publication” — 938 rows. Some of these were still printed in English places (eg Bath), just without specifying England, so I didn’t simply remove all 938 of these.
I started doing it this way: England|London|Bath|Andover|Berwick|Blackfriars|Blandford|Bolton|Brearley Hall|Lincolnhire|Bristol|Burton|Bury|Carlisle|Cirencester|Cork|Coventry|Dorset|Dover|Grinstead|Falmouth (filtering for ones that didn’t have these other cities) then gave up
Flagged all 938 rows
Removed 41 rows that didn’t match England|London and did match Scotland|Wales
Unflagged rows that matched Halifax or London. Created a facet to look at flagged rows.
Unflagged rows that matched Bath|Andover|Berwick|Blackfriars|Blandford|Bolton|Brearley Hall|Lincolnhire|Bristol|Burton|Bury|Carlisle|Cirencester|Cork|Coventry|Dorset|Dover|Grinstead|Falmouth
Unflagged Plymouth|Leicester
Remove New York|Boston|Dublin
Scrolled through and clicked “include” on individual English locations to unflag 84 more rows
This left me with 264 flagged rows for 84 locations
Scrolled through and clicked “include” on individual obviously non-English locations to delete 52 rows
I changed my mind about Halifax and removed it — removed 123 rows that said JUST Halifax (keeping the ones that listed both Halifax and England)
Unflagged Sherborne, Taunton, North an South Shields
Removed Monmouth (it’s in Wales)
Removed 40 rows with a blank place of publication
Scrolled and unflagged English towns
Removed Newport and Channel Islands
Looking up full entry in ESTC, removed Lorient, Lunden (place in Germany, not a misprint for London)

After filtering out all non-England publishers, I have 51,090 rows — down from 51,407, so I removed 317 rows.</Text>

            <Title>Mary Robinson - scholarship</Title>
            <Text>Robinson’s public stature fell sharply after her death. Behrendt’s comparison of posthumous reviews of Robinson’s work with reviews of Charlotte Smith’s work highlights the fact that “unlike Smith she was widely regarded as the instigator rather than the victim of her misfortunes” (192), due to the ‘immorality’ of her choices; as a result, her claims to sympathy and sensibility are dismissed by early nineteenth century reviewers. Behrendt argues that her “notorious public behaviour seems to have ensured that she would not get anything like a fair hearing as an artist among the conventional critics of the time. Her case is a painful reminder of the pervasive power of a self-appointed coterie of predominantly male critics who considered themselves custodians of national public morality” (192). Susan Civale’s work on Robinson’s immediate nineteenth century reception bears out this dismissal of Robinson “as an artist” (Behrendt 192). Civale highlights the disparity between Robinson’s poetry and fiction and her Memoirs: even after Robinson’s other works had fallen out of print, the Memoirs continued to be reprinted, and to spur new writing in the form of “reviews, essays, spin-off novels, illustrations, poems, mini-biographies, entries in multibiographies, and citations in the life writing of other key figures” (194). It was Robinson’s biography, rather than her writing, which “continued to interest, perplex, and charm readers” (Civale 194).
When literary scholars began to be interested again in Robinson in the 1990s, their work continued to be shaped by an intense awareness of her personal life and her theatrical career, often examining her works for the performance of Robinson’s identity communicated within them. [For example, Judith Pascoe’s 1997 Romantic Theatricality - “According to Pascoe, Robinson enacted in her writing an ever-shifting public identity” (Cross 6).] [Also Susan Luther, Stuart Curran, Eleanor Ty, and Sharon Setzer]. The theatrical performance of celebrity remains, as Ashley Cross argues, “the dominant lens through which her writing and her career have been interpreted” (6). The other major lens is Robinson’s interaction with other Romantic poets, “in particular her relations with Coleridge and the Della Cruscans, to a lesser extent Wordsworth and, more recently, Southey and Smith” (Cross 6). This examination of the poetic Robinson nonetheless often employs the same framings as work on the theatrical celebrity Robinson, in emphasizing the strategic development of personae for public attention. Cross argues that “[t]he  publication  of  the  eight-volume  complete  Works  by  Mary  Robinson  by  Pickering  and  Chatto  (2009–2010),  under  the  direction  of  William  Brewer,  marked  Robinson’s  official  reentrance  into  the  literary  canon” (12), [but is she really “in” the canon as an artist?]</Text>

            <Title>disciplinary infrastructure</Title>
            <Text>“But however essential it is for data-rich literary history, modeling cannot be the sole foundation for the field. Models of literary systems are not simply arguments about the existence of and connections between literary works in the past; they are arguments made with reference to the disciplinary infrastructure—the bibliographies and collections, analog and digital—that transmit evidence of past works and relationships to the present. Modeling, even when integrated with descriptive bibliography as I have described, does not reflect on this transmission. Models embody a scholar’s arguments, whereas disciplinary infrastructure is an effect of multiple arguments: a sequence of assumptions, decisions, representations, and remediations. Such histories of transmission shape how the researcher can explore, and what she can know of, the historical context that disciplinary infrastructure appears to represent. To adequately perform literary history, data-rich projects must investigate these histories of transmission and how they constitute the documentary record.” (Bode 42)

“The distinctions or gaps between the context signified by collections and the exemplars used in signification might partly arise from, but are not simply the consequence of, successive exclusions of documents, as the Stanford Literary Lab Pamphlet 11 suggests. In chapter 1 I noted that, in defining “the published,” “the archive,” and “the corpus” as progressively smaller selections, those authors admit the constructed nature Page 44 →of literary data. Yet they also argue that mass-digitization largely avoids those exclusions, such that “the corpus of a project can now easily be (almost) as large as the archive, while the archive is itself becoming—at least for modern times (almost) as large as all of published literature” (Algee-Hewitt et al., 2).
Even with their account of the considerable practical challenges involved in accessing versions of specific literary works, this description of mass digitization drastically diminishes the degree of exclusion involved in constructing such collections. ” (Bode 43-4)

“Digitized collections are partial in another way, in that combining the holdings of multiple analog collections tends to obscure the individual histories of the contributing collections and their implications for the form, scope, and critical capacity of the resulting digital one.” (Bode 44)

“Collections have always been constituted in this way. In analog collections, documents are represented and remediated through the cataloging systems that organize holdings and the interfaces that interpret them: the card catalogs, special collection indexes, or online library catalogs that provide a method of searching and a type, form, and detail of metadata. … A key difference between analog collections and digital ones is that literary historians rarely, if ever, treat the former (a given library, for instance) as proxies for literature as it circulated and was understood in the past, whereas digital collections such as Google Books or HathiTrust are sometimes assumed to be representative in this way.” (Bode 44)

“Due to their multiplicity and complex interaction, the components involved in producing digital collections expand access to the historical record in certain ways, even as they increase the likelihood of unrealized and significant disjunctions between the access we intend and the access we achieve. Digital humanities scholars recognize that digital infrastructure shapes knowledge production, and digital literary historians have responded with explicitly curatorial approaches to constructing and exploring digital documents and collections.” (Bode 45)

“These digital humanities projects highlight four features that I believe should also underpin the modeling of literary systems in data-rich literary history. First is a critical assessment of the relationship between the historical context analyzed and the digital collection(s) used for analysis; second is detailed attention to the relationship between the documents included in the digital collection(s) and the terms in which they are represented; third is explicit discussion of the means by which data are extracted and modeled; and fourth is a published record of data arising from that extensive history of transmission. Existing projects in data-rich literary history often (though by no means universally) demonstrate the second and third of these features. The need for data publication, and for platforms and modes of review to support it, is also increasingly recognized and enacted.7 But data-rich literary history projects rarely consider how the disciplinary infrastructure analyzed relates to the historical context investigated. The lack of shared standards for data publication—and, more specifically, of a framework for combining these four features in investigating and representing the transmission and transformation of historical evidence to and in the present—problematizes the field’s capacity to advance historical knowledge.” (Bode 46)

“Proprietary mass-digitized collections such as Google Books, Early English Books Online, and The British Newspaper Archive (owned by Google, ProQuest, and findmypast, respectively) are increasingly used in humanities research. But their scope and scale—let alone the histories of transmission that produce them—can be very difficult to discern; indeed, the commercial imperatives of these enterprises arguably depend on them presenting these collections as comprehensive.” (Bode 47)</Text>

            <Text>‘In 1978, an operational test was conducted in the New York Public Library, under the guidance of Professor Terry Belanger, to assess the methodology of an American counterpart to the British editorial effort. In 1979, this resulted in the formation of the team in Louisiana State University, under the direction of Professor Henry Snyder.” (Crump 105)
”soon after the ESTC cataloguing rules had been established in 1979, a project, based at Munster under the direction of professor Bernhard Fabian, was begun to catalogue the holdings of the University of Gottingen Library to the same standards. This project, the fruits of which will be published in 1986, has enjoyed a close relationship with the British Library editorial office. Where ESTC records already existed, these were adopted as the Gottingen record and only those works not held in the ESTC base file were catalogued again. Similar arrangements were adopted with regard to two parts of the Early Imprints Project (New South Wales and South Australia), which is seeking to record all early imprints in New Zealand and Australia. A catalogue of the Catholic Libraries in Sydney w a s produced earlier this year.” (Crump 105)

“RLIN was chosen because it is an interactive on-line system as opposed to BLAISE/LOCAS (the local
catalogue production service of BLAISE), which updates in batch mode. The terminal in the British Library, soon to be joined by six others, is the first tangible sign of this visionary endeavour. It was anticipated that, with effect from October 1985, both ESTC teams would work on this single, interactive system and therefore be able to have almost instant access to the fruits of each other’s labours. Once ESTC has gained experience of using the system, the British Library will experiment with other uses to which RLIN might be put. The link via Washington will also give the Library direct access to the National Library of Medicine.
It is hoped that this development will result in a more complete and coherent ’first edition’ of ESTC, which will be published in 1989. In the meantime, the ESTC file is available to scholars on both BLAISE- LINE and on RLIN.” (Crump 106)

“No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page. Subject areas can be isolated by keyword and the search can be further refined by place or country of publication. The output of a particular printer can be readily retrieved and then charted in terms of numbers per decade or per year. However, the most exciting quality of having the file mounted on the national database is the way in which it becomes of use, not only for searches such as these, but also for people working in disciplines that might not previously have resorted to the printed short title catalogues for the earlier periods. Furthermore, the searches outlined above presuppose large bodies of material, but the file can be used just as easily to verify a hunch in which a zero result would be a significant finding. A simplified manual for searching the file on-line has been prepared and is available free of charge from the editorial office.” (Crump 106)</Text>

            <Text>The goal of this serious thinking, for Felski, is to remind us “that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized” — a discovery which will “shock” us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite to understant that future ways of life will also be organized differently. For Sedgwick, too, the possibility of “surprise” in a non-paranoid reading, the idea that even the most predictable past events could have unfolded differently, is crucial for imagining change in the future. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing aftershocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that “our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices” are not universal and invulnerable. Robert Miles is one of many to describe the impact of the French Revolution as centred less on individual events, and more on the alarming “historical rupture” which the revolution was seen to constitute. For many, this rupture represented an opportunity for optimism — but many more experienced the turmoil as near-apocalyptic, and even for optimists the sense of impending change was often uncomfortable. Miles argues that a widespread sense of profound change shaped far more than just political thought: “The sense of crisis … linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.” One way that these works were shaped by their context is a heightened sense of timeliness for published works.</Text>

            <Text>Ian Gadd argues that critiques of digital databases are often not based on the right grounds: “the real risk of scholarly misuse of [Early English Books Online] is less to do with the physical features of early printed books that it fails, one way or another, to represent (problematic though these are) and more to do with a lack of an informed knowledge of what exactly EEBO is.” (Gadd 682) The observation applies far beyond EEBO: although it is easiest to critique digital resources for their failures to perfectly replicate the full tactile experience of the books they simulate, or for failing to contain every possible book, those critiques are fundamentally futile. [What other critiques are possible?] This chapter examines the history, textual selection, and implicit model of six databases: the ESTC, ECCO, ECCO-TCP, Project Gutenberg, Google Books, and HathiTrust. I explore how each database encodes its assumptions about what literature is, who it is for, and how it should be used. I historicize these models in the context of the institutional infrastructure behind the creation of each resource, particularly the economic factors driving development. I argue that the differences between each database’s literary model are best understood as the result of different strategies to navigate conflict between commercial and anti-commercial values. In parallel, I follow Charlotte Smith through each of these databases, to explore the impact of their different literary models. Very different works by Smith are available in each resource, and in very different formats. Smith’s most major works are not readily available, suggesting that these literary archives lag behind scholarly consensus about her importance. The chapter concludes with a discussion of new developments in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which can be used to transcribe texts from page images. [OCR BLUF.]

            <Title>running gender on ECCO sample</Title>
            <Text>To get a handle on how the gender package in R actually worked, and to assess how well it would meet my needs for this project, I began my making a sample csv of 41 arbitrary titles from ECCO’s 1789 holdings. The choice was driven by simplicity for a proof of concept: my ESTC and full-ECCO files were too large to open on my computer in spreadsheet software, and writing a program to extract a random sample was more work than it was worth, so I chose a file that I knew I could open in Numbers, the sample of all 1789 ECCO titles which I had recently downloaded through Gale’s Digital Scholar Lab. I selected some rows from the top of the list, skimming the names as I went to make sure I had selected enough titles that they would include two by women, and then copied those rows to a new spreadsheet (ECCO-1789-sample.csv). After some false starts with RStudio, I was still struggling to read the file into the program. Since all I wanted to know was whether, once I got it running, the gender package would tell me results worth working with, I decided to do this first test in whatever way would get a result, even if it required a great deal of non-scalable manual labor.
I copied the authors column into a plaintext file, and manually created a comma-separated list of just the first name of each other, to match the data format which the gender package required. (I took the first word before a space in each name, to reflect how a future first-name-grabber algorithm would work, even when this meant choosing things which were clearly not first names — one of my core questions is how the gender package will handle those kinds of exceptions.) The resulting list of names was saved as ECCO-1789-sample-firstnames.csv. Trying to paste in this list for the names finally helped me understand what is meant by a “character vector” in R. It’s basically an array of strings. You have to make the character vector before you can run gender() on it. Sample code:
names = c("john", "madison") # creates a character vector called “names” by ‘combining (c-ing) two strings
gender(names, method = "demo", years = 1985) # guesses gender for both of those names
Once I had gotten something to produce guesses for more than one name, I wanted to try using a method other than “demo.” This sent me down a spiral of trying to install genderdata, and trying to install devtools to install genderdata. Finally I got everything installed and able to run!
If a command is run requesting a name-year-method combination for which the package has no data, it simply returns an empty “tibble.” The following three sets of results illustrate the limits and possibilities of napp and ipums data:

&gt; gender(ECCOnames, method = "ipums", years = 1789) - earliest year possible with ipums

Neither is very stunningly thorough, especially since the year is supposed to reflect the birth year of the person, and I can only barely get information about the year they published something. Somewhat to my surprise, the ipums method — which I originally planned to reject in favor of napp, because ipums is US only — has much more data available, and doesn’t seem to reflect any US-specific oddities. So, I might try to use both ipums and napp, but if that is difficult, just using ipums seems appropriate. I’m not entirely sure, yet, whether using ipums will be faster than just manually assigning genders: my next question, I think, is determining how many unique first names there are, and then trying to guess how many of them ipums would be able to sort out for me. It managed 25/41 = 61% of the random ECCO sample, which is a substantial number, especially since it will by definition include the most common names. Expanding the acceptable years slightly also seems to help it know a lot more about the names, while still according with my own estimates. (ipums can learn “Augustus” in 1799, for example.)

Some pair programming with Tina helped me get the program running on the actual csv of the sampl data. They helped me identify that each session needs to start by setting my working directory and running the library I want. They also helped with the syntax to read in the csv as a dataframe and get a character vector of just one column of information.
They said I should bring the data itself in accordance with what the package expects, rather than telling R to look at it selectively, so I opened ECCO-1789_metadata.csv in OpenRefine. I split the “Author” column on the separator of “ ” (a space), limited to two new columns, to make a “First name” column with the first word of the Author column and a “Last names” column with everything else. I then exported this as a new csv and ran gender(ECCO1789names, method = "ipums", years = 1799) on it. It worked!!</Text>

            <Title>fruitful models</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation understands archives, bibliographies, anthologies, and corpora to all be, variously, models of an imagined object of study. In the language of social science, these models might be described as ‘samples,’ which are intended to permit discoveries about an underlying ‘population’ by being ‘representative’ of that population’s features. Only the language and not the methods of social science need to be imported here, since it has long been ordinary practice in literary studies to select and examine representative texts for insights about larger movements. A work like Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830, for example, clearly names the population of works which are of interest to her: all Gothic novels published between 1790 and 1830. She tentatively defines her principles of selection as _____. But in providing detailed information on 208 texts — mostly Gothic, mostly novels, mostly between 1790 and 1830 — Tracy obviously does not claim to have presented all that might belong within this population. Instead, her book operates as a model of the underlying population, which can be queried for further insight into ‘the Gothic novel, 1790-1830’ only so long as one keeps the limits of the model in mind. Indeed, by presenting plot summaries and bibliographic data, rather than reproducing the novels in full, Tracy provides a model of a model. One challenge to studying these models is that they present a “moving target”: even a bibliography or anthology is subject to change through successive editions (not to mention their now-common digital supplements), and a digital database has the potential to change daily. I follow Kath Bode’s approach in A World of Fiction, in artificially “freezing” each resource for study, and presenting my analysis as a description of a snapshot in time. Importantly, a model is a tool for thinking, and not necessarily a truth claim in itself: creating a model is a way of saying, ‘it might be helpful to think of X as Y,’ not an assertion that X is equivalent to Y. Willard McCarty articulates this important feature of models by stressing that a model’s value is determined not by its exact correspondence with the object it models — if it were possible to fully examine the underlying object, then no model would be necessary — but by the fruitfulness of its simplifications. Even a deeply incorrect model can be fruitful if its divergence from observed phenomena rules out an incorrect theory. As I examine the many existing models of ‘English literature, 1789-1799,’ and create several more of my own, I articulate the underlying assumptions of each model, and assess the fruitfulness of the results.</Text>
            <Comments>Kath Bode and Leah Price have both described at length how textual editing and anthologizing, respectively, are literary methods of sampling. See: Bode, Katherine. A World of Fiction: Digital Collections and the Future of Literary History. University of Michigan Press, 2018. And Price, Leah. The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel: From Richardson to George Eliot. Cambridge UP, 2000.
Because Bode is examining only one database, she is able to present a single date on which her data collection ceased. I have not been able to accomplish this, but for any given resource, will identify the date of that resource’s “snapshot.” This approach means that my observations may be out of date from the moment I make them, though one of my findings in chapter 2 is that many databases are currently changing more slowly than one might expect.

            <Text>“…one can certainly argue that the project is as old as Google itself. In 1996, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were graduate computer science students working on a research project supported by the Stanford Digital Library Technologies Project. Their goal was to make digital libraries work, and their big idea was as follows: in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a “web crawler” to index the books’ content and analyze the connections between them, determining any given book’s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books. The crawler they wound up building was called BackRub, and it was this modern twist on traditional citation analysis that inspired Google’s PageRank algorithms – the core search technology that makes Google, well, Google.” (“Google Books History”)

2002: “A small group of Googlers officially launches the secret “books” project. They begin talking to experts about the challenges ahead, starting with a simple but crucial question: how long would it take to digitally scan every book in the world? It turns out, oddly enough, that no one knows. In typical Google fashion, Larry Page decides to experiment on his own. In the office one day, he and Marissa Mayer, one of our first product managers, use a metronome to keep rhythm as they methodically turn the pages of a 300-page volume. It takes a full 40 minutes to reach the end. Inspired by the extraordinary digitization projects underway all around the world – the Library of Congress’s American Memory project, Project Gutenberg, the Million Book Project and the Universal Library, to name only a few – the team embarks on a series of site visits to learn about how they work. As part of this fact-finding mission, Larry Page reaches out to the University of Michigan, his alma mater and a pioneer in library digitization efforts including JSTOR and Making of America. When he learns that the current estimate for scanning the university library’s seven million volumes is 1,000 years, he tells university president Mary Sue Coleman he believes Google can help make it happen in six.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)

2003: The team works to develop a high-speed scanning process — “A team member travels to a charity book fair in Phoenix, Arizona, to acquire books for testing non-destructive scanning techniques. After countless rounds of experimentation, the team develops a scanning method that’s much gentler than current common high-speed processes. … At the same time, the team’s software engineers make progress toward resolving the tricky technical issues they encounter processing information from books that contain odd type sizes, unusual fonts or other unexpected peculiarities – in 430 different languages.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)

2004: formal partnership with Bodleian library “to digitize the library’s incomparable collection of more than one million 19th-century public domain books within three years.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)
“In October, Larry and Sergey announce “Google Print” at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany. The first publishers to join the program: Blackwell, Cambridge University Press, the University of Chicago Press, Houghton Mifflin, Hyperion, McGraw-Hill, Oxford University Press, Pearson, Penguin, Perseus, Princeton University Press, Springer, Taylor &amp; Francis, Thomson Delmar and Warner Books. In December, we announce the beginning of the “Google Print” Library Project, made possible by partnerships with Harvard, the University of Michigan, the New York Public Library, Oxford and Stanford. The combined collections at these extraordinary libraries are estimated to exceed 15 million volumes.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)

“Every weekday, semi trucks full of books would pull up at designated Google scanning centers. … The books were unloaded from the trucks onto the kind of carts you find in libraries and wheeled up to human operators sitting at one of a few dozen brightly lit scanning stations, arranged in rows about six to eight feet apart. … Each one could digitize books at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour. The book would lie in a specially designed motorized cradle that would adjust to the spine, locking it in place. Above, there was an array of lights and at least $1,000 worth of optics, including four cameras, two pointed at each half of the book, and a range-finding LIDAR that overlaid a three-dimensional laser grid on the book’s surface to capture the curvature of the paper. … What made the system so efficient is that it left so much of the work to software. Rather than make sure that each page was aligned perfectly, and flattened, before taking a photo, which was a major source of delays in traditional book-scanning systems, cruder images of curved pages were fed to de-warping algorithms, which used the LIDAR data along with some clever mathematics to artificially bend the text back into straight lines. At its peak, the project involved about 50 full-time software engineers.” (Somers)

2005: “In keeping with our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful, we donate $3 million to the Library of Congress to help build the World Digital Library, which will provide online access to a collection of rare and unique items from all around the world. We also extend our pilot scanning program with the Library, which includes digitizing works of historical value from the Library of Congress Law Library. Google renames “Google Print” Google Books, which more accurately reflects how people use it. The team also responds to the controversy over the Library Project by engaging in public debate about its underlying principles.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)

2006: “We launch a series of product enhancements to make Book Search more useful and easier to use. First, we expand access to the public domain works we’ve scanned by adding a download a PDF button to all out-of-copyright books. A few months later, we release a new browsing interface that makes it easier to browse and navigate Book Search. The new interface is also accompanied by new About this Book pages which use Google algorithms to populate pages with rich related content on a book -- initially, related books, selected pages and references from scholarly works. In the fall, four new libraries join the Library Project: the University of California, University Complutense of Madrid, the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the University of Virginia.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)

2007: “Using the new UI as a launching point, we experiment with new ways for people to interact with books.
Places in this Book: A mashup with Maps lets people browse books by locations mentioned in the text (later, we release an experimental KML layer for Google Earth that does the reverse -- the user picks a location, and we map books to it).
Popular Passages: We create a new way to navigate between books, tracking the use of a single passage through a collection of books.
My Library: We help people harness the power of Google search within their own personal book collections. Users begin to curate and share their personal libraries, reviews and ratings with others.
New homepage (initially US only): We give people more jumping off points for exploring the books in our index.
… we add a “View plain text” link to all out-of-copyright books. T.V. Raman explains how this opens the book to adaptive technologies such as screen readers and Braille display” (“Google Books History,” 2016)
“By December, the Book Search interface is available in over 35 languages, from Japanese to Czech to Finnish.  Over 10,000 publishers and authors from 100+ countries are participating in the Book Search Partner Program.” (“Google Books History,” 2016)
“In May, the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne, and Ghent University Library join the Book Search program, adding a substantial amount of books in French, German, Flemish, Latin and other languages, and bringing the total number of European libraries partners to six. …  Over 10,000 publishers and authors from 100+ countries are participating in the Book Search Partner Program.  The Library Project expands to 28 partners, including seven international library partners: Oxford University (UK), University of Complutense of Madrid (Spain), the National Library of Catalonia (Spain), University Library of Lausanne (Switzerland), Ghent University (Belgium) and Keio University (Japan).”(“Google Books History,” 2016)

The “Google Books History” page ends with 2007, with the final words of “As we look to the year ahead, we continue to develop our technology and expand our partnerships with publishers and libraries all around the world. Stay tuned...” but the page spent more than a decade with no further updates. Some time between August 2019 and March 2020, the page was edited so that it no longer had a year-by-year breakdown of milestones. Now, after briefly telling the anecdote about the 1996 origin of Google Books, the “history” says ”Fast forward to today:
After more than a decade of evolution, innovation and strong partnerships, Google Books has helped to make more than 40 million books discoverable, in more than 400 languages.
And we're not done -- not until all of the books in the world can be found by everyone, everywhere, at any time they need them.” (“Google Books History,” 2020)

2008, the year that Google stops being quite so proud of the rapid progress of Google Books, is also the year that they begin to face legal repercussions for their “scan first and ask questions later” approach to mass digitization. Somers has characterized this process as equivalent to the burning of the library of Alexandria: “When the most significant humanities project of our time was dismantled in court, the scholars, archivists, and librarians who’d had a hand in its undoing breathed a sigh of relief, for they believed, at the time, that they had narrowly averted disaster” (Somers).

            <Title>research methods for corpora comparisons</Title>
            <Text>My biggest-scale question is: I have all of these different corpora of stuff from 1789-99. How can I compare what they contain? If people only worked with the absolute easiest corpus to access (ECCO-TCP), what would they be leaving out?

I want to develop a consistent ontology (in the computer science definition of the word) to apply to all of the corpora, so I can directly compare what kinds of materials each includes. It's important for this ontology to be able to tell me things like "this corpus consists entirely of plays" (because one of them definitely does) but I don't know how to know in advance what categories I'll need. (I'm going to ask my mom about this, ontologies are her jam.)

Then I want to look at each individual corpus and classify its contents into my ontology categories. I'll probably do this computationally also, but it's important to me to classify at least some of each corpus by hand, to check (or train?) my computational approach. Since I can't classify 52,000 things by hand (1 minute per thing = 866 hours) I want to take a random sample, classify *that*, and say "the whole thing probably looks roughly like this." I'll probably be classifying just by title / title page so they should all be able to "respond," but if I want to look at how well those titles reflect the actual content I might start bumping up against works that I can't access (and also I'll want to use smaller samples so I can spend longer on each item.)

I'd like to use the smallest sample that is still acceptably trustworthy. I don't know what is considered acceptably trustworthy: 70%? 98%?

I have several corpora -- smallest one 466 items, biggest one 52,000 -- so I am looking for a calculation to run each time I decide to sample a new corpus. (My first instinct was to pick one number and sample that many of each one, but on reflection, that's... not right, is it? Should I sample the same *percentage* of each one?)

I'm basically treating each corpus as a non-random sample of the platonic ideal of "Printed Works In Britain 1789-99" and trying to see how each corpus represents that platonic ideal, and also trying to inch closer to that platonic ideal.</Text>

            <Title>key points</Title>
            <Text>The crux of much of my distress: “Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To content otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the /actively/ excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)
“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)
Because the canon and the curriculum are not in fact identical, I can begin curricular reform without having to finish solving canonical reform.</Text>

            <Title>all Radcliffe editions</Title>
            <Text>Ann Radcliffe stands in contrast to More, Smith, and Robinson in many ways. One of these is the relative brevity of her bibliography. She published six works during this dissertation’s decade of interest— five novels and a volume of travel writing— and this is all that is published during her lifetime. Where her bibliography grows extensive is the number of reprintings. Although this dissertation will consider only those works published in England, the following chronology of Radcliffe’s editions includes international editions as an indication of Radcliffe’s reach.
In 1789, Radcliffe publishes The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne in London. In 1790, A Sicilian Romance in London. In 1792, The Romance of the Forest appears in London and in Dublin. This novel earns her more positive notice and revives interest in the first two. Athlin &amp; Dunbayne also has its first Dublin edition in 1792, and Sicilian Romance has a second London edition and a German translation in Hannover. In 1793, Athlin &amp; Dunbayne has a second London edition, and Romance of the Forest a second Dublin edition, as well as a German translation in Leipzig. In 1794, Radcliffe publishes her fourth novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho, which has three total editions that year, two in London and one in Dublin. 1794 also sees the continued popularity of Romance of the Forest in a second London edition and a French translation in Paris. In 1795, Radcliffe publishes her only non-novel work, the travelogue A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794, which saw two editions in London, one edition in Dublin, and a French translation in Paris all in the year of its release. 1795 also saw the increased reach of Radcliffe’s other works: Sicilian Romance has its first American edition; Romance of the Forest two American editions; and Udolpho reached its third London edition, second Dublin edition, first American edition, and its first German translation. In 1796, Radcliffe published no new works, but Athlin &amp; Dunbayne saw its first American edition; Sicilian Romance reached its third London edition; and Romance of the Forest reached its third London edition and its second French edition in Paris. In 1797, she publishes the last new novel to be released during her lifetime, The Italian. In its first year, The Italian has one edition in London, one in Dublin, two editions in America, two French editions in Paris, and a German edition in Konigsberg. 1797 also sees the first French editions of Athlin &amp; Dunbayne, Sicilian Romance, and Udolpho. In 1798, there are no domestic editions of Radcliffe, but many international: Sicilian Romance has its second and third French editions; Romance of the Forest has its third French edition; Udolpho has its second French edition and second German edition; The Italian has its third French edition. In 1799, Athlin &amp; Dunbayne has its third London edition; Romance of the Forest its fourth London edition; Journey in Summer 1794 its second French edition; and The Italian its fourth French edition.
After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Radcliffe’s works continued to be reprinted domestically and internationally frequently. In 1800, Romance of the Forest reaches its third Dublin edition, and its fourth French edition; Udolpho reaches its third Dublin edition, and its second American edition. In 1801, Sicilian Romance reaches its fourth French edition and The Italian its second German edition. In 1802, Romance of the Forest reaches its fifth French edition. Also in 1802, Radcliffe wrote, but did not publish, Gaston de Blondville, which would finally appear in print posthumously in 1826. In 1803, Romance of the Forest reached its third American edition, and Udolpho its fifth London edition. In 1804, unusually, no works appeared under Radcliffe’s name. In 1805, The Italian reaches its second Dublin edition. In 1806, Romance of the Forest reaches its fifth London edition, and Udolpho its sixth and seventh London editions. In 1807, again, no works appear. In 1808, Udolpho reaches its third French edition in Paris, and also seems to have been printed in an English edition in Paris; The Italian reaches its fifth French edition. In 1809, Sicilian Romance reaches its fourth London edition, and Udolpho its eighth London edition. In 1810, Romance of the Forest reaches its sixth London edition, Udolpho its ninth London edition, and The Italian its third German edition. In 1811, Athlin &amp; Dunbayne reaches its fourth London edition, and The Italian its second London edition. 1812 and 1813 see no publications. In 1814, Journey in Summer 1794 reaches its third London edition. In 1815, no publications appear. In 1816, a “new” publication appears: an unauthorized volume Poems by Mrs Ann Radcliffe, anthologizing poems previously appearing in her novels. Udolpho also reaches its tenth London edition in 1816, and has its first Italian translation. No works appear in 1817. In 1818, Sicilian Romance has its fifth London edition, and Romance of the Forest has its sixth French edition and a what is probably a Russian translation in Moscow. In 1819, all five novels reach new editions: Athlin &amp; Dunbayne has its second French edition, Sicilian Romance its fifth French edition and first editions in Russian and in Spanish, Romance of the Forest has its seventh London edition, Udolpho its fourth French edition, and The Italian its sixth French edition. In 1820, Sicilian Romance reaches its sixth London edition, Romance of the Forest its eighth London edition, and Udolpho reaches its third American edition and its eleventh and twelfth London editions. In 1821 Athlin &amp; Dunbayne reaches its fifth London edition, and Udolpho its fourth American edition. No editions appear in 1822.
 Radcliffe dies in February of 1823. This prompts reprints of all of her works by S. Fisher in 1823, and by Ballantyne in 1824. In 1826, her husband published several pieces posthumously: a final novel Gaston de Blondeville; a poetic piece St. Alban’s Abbey, a metrical tale; with some poetical pieces...To which is prefixed a memoir of the author, with extracts from her journals; and, in New Monthly Magazine, her unfinished essay “On the Supernatural in Poetry”.</Text>
            <Comments>It’s my intention to produce a bibliography at this level of comprehensiveness for each of my four “key” authors. Perhaps as a table rather than paragraphs??
Radcliffe was paid £500 for this work, which was a highly-anticipated sensation (Facer)
She was paid £800 for The Italian.</Comments>

            <Title>print culture proof of Locke's importance</Title>
            <Text>It is clear that in the first decade of the eighteenth century ‘Locke on government’ did in fact achieve distinctive status. In 1703 Leslie was provoked to his assault by the reputation of ‘the great L—k’ who, dangerously, ‘makes the consent of every individual necessary’ (RLP, ii, p. 62). In 1709 a cartoon depicted the Whig polemi- cist Benjamin Hoadly at his writing desk with ‘Locke on government’ on his bookshelf. By 1716 the Two Treatises was quoted in parliament. Locke’s influence was facilitated by informal means of transmission. The anonymous Vox Populi, Vox Dei (1709) was a bestselling anthology comprising extracts from Whig-approved texts, including the Two Treatises. Extracts from the Two Treatises also appeared in John Toland’s Anglia Libera (1701) and else- where. Some early readers of the Two Treatises saw it as a handbook for political education, designed to wean the gentry elite from the dangerous (and largely clerical) absurdities of pre-Revolution doctrine. It represented a guide to ‘polite’ citizenship, free of the sycophantic dogmas of absolutist Court society. This role is explicit in William Atwood’s Fundamental Consti- tution of the English Government (1690) which urged that people should ‘take every morning some pages of the Two Treatises of Government, for an effec- tual catholicon against nonsense and absurdities’ (RLP, i, p. 39). The Two Treatises continued to be an instrument of instruction against the follies of the ‘divine right of kings’ in Hoadly’s works and in John Shute Barrington’s The Revolution and Anti-Revolution Principles Stated (1714).

            <Title>McCarty: interdisciplinary</Title>
            <Text>Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that “[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation”: the current state of “digital humanities” research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to “hard sciences.” The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables — an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti — is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,” it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy — a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.

            <Title>blog post: state of books in the world</Title>
            <Text>The problem of textual selection— the paired difficulty and importance of deciding which few books one will actually read— is an urgently meaningful problem in the “real world,” outside the realms of academia. A common solution is one which will likely alarm and distress most scholars who have dedicated themselves to thinking through canonical selection, or even the construction of a syllabus: a solution which could perhaps be called ‘radical impatience.’ Consider, for example, the following advice in a blog post, “100 Ways to Live Better,” item number 6, the first entry in the category “Mind”:
There are more great podcasts than you’ll ever have the time to listen to. If it sucks after 10 minutes, skip half an hour ahead. Still boring? Delete and move on. Obviously, do the same for books.
There is much for a literary scholar to find distressing here. The operant metric that another’s ideas “suck” if they are “boring” in the first ten or thirty minutes. The fact that “obviously” the same metrics apply for books as for podcasts. Indeed, even the fact that podcasts so strongly come before books as the default way to encounter new ideas. On the website, each word in the first sentence provides a link to a specific podcast recommended by the writer, indicating a proliferation of individual desirable podcasts, but “books” are a monolith and a footnote.

Later we see another metric for textual selection:
Should you watch that movie / play that game / read that book? Use the ratio:
([# who rated it 5/5] + [# who rated it 1/5]) / [# who rated it 3/5].
This doesn’t apply to everything, but it applies to many things, including media. There are too many options out there to waste time on mediocrity, and everything great will be divisive.
Paired with the first piece of advice, this would suggest a process of seeking out divisive and controversial works, determining within ten minutes whether one is strongly in sympathy or strongly opposed, and continuing only with works which evoke strong sympathy.
Of the seven mentions of the word “book,” two are in fact the word “Facebook.” Two are the pieces of advice quoted above. Two are suggestions to find “good audiobooks, and/or a dog” to form a habit of going on walks, or “a good app or guidebook” to practice meditation. And the last is the advice that “If you’ve been waiting for months for someone to create an event and invite you, whether it’s a book discussion or a BDSM orgy, just throw one yourself,” in which “a book discussion” functions rhetorically as an extreme example of an unusual and improbable kind of social event, paired against its assumed opposite extreme.</Text>

            <Title>model 1: ESTC</Title>
            <Text>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 
I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.</Text>

            <Text>The specific experimentation undertaken in chapter two tests the basic assumptions and methods of my project. I identify what subset of Smith’s works each corpus contains, as a concrete example to compare their holdings overall. Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets, for example, are not included in the ECCO-TCP corpus (which is the one most often used for text mining research) — only Celestina and The Emigrants are included. Why these two texts? And what text mining research based on ECCO-TCP might have found slightly different answers if Smith’s sonnets had been included? As a related test of comparison between databases, for each database which provides access to the actual text of Smith’s works, I compare the textual similarity of Celestina and The Emigrants. What editorial choices are being made? How much worse is the OCR text than the transcribed text? Another key concept I will explore through Smith is the role of reprints. HathiTrust, for example, includes multiple editions of Elegiac Sonnets. How reliable and effective are its distinctions between editions? How do the databases I examine handle multiple editions of a single work? I am particularly interested in how reprints can be incorporated into our understanding of what literature is “of” a particular decade: what does it mean to think of Elegiac Sonnets, initially printed in the 1780s, as “1790s literature”? Finally, having surveyed my six databases with the help of Smith, I discuss the multiple “Smiths” which emerge, and what it means to attempt to unify her disparate works.
Chapter three does for Robinson the same initial process that chapter two did for Smith: I assemble, from a range of scholarly resources, an authoritative list of Robinson’s publications, and seek them in each of the six databases. My initial hypothesis is that, due to Robinson’s different posthumous reception, proportionally fewer of her works will be included in smaller archives compared to Charlotte Smith. In addition to comparing Robinson’s inclusion to Smith’s, I will use Robinson to explore the structural makeup of my databases, examining their representation of “authorship” the way I used Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets to examine their representation of “editions.” Robinson frequently wrote under pseudonyms or left works unsigned: how do the databases I examine handle authorship attribution? Discussing the digital encoding of Robinson’s authorship raises the subject of authorship more generally, as a flexible concept which can resist strict encoding.  In particular, it draws attention to the importance of unsigned works, as distinct from anonymous works, and “open secrets” of authorship. As with Smith, I close the chapter with a consideration of Robinson herself as an author.
Chapter four uses Ann Radcliffe as an important contrast to Charlotte Smith and especially to Mary Robinson, to challenge the ease with which the number of unique titles can stand in for both “popularity” and “importance.” Taking as my premise that Radcliffe was unquestionably both popular and important in the 1790s, I examine the extent to which she does (or does not) rise to attention within my corpora of that decade. I explore both print runs and reviews as important supplementary forms of information, and prototype and test computational methods to integrate these kinds of information with more accessible metadata. Print runs are of particular importance to interpreting Radcliffe’s career, since a large run of one edition can represent far more actual books produced than several small editions, and Radcliffe’s celebrity often meant large print runs. To compare her output to Smith’s and Robinson’s, I test and compare a few methods of calculating the total number of books printed for each author during the decade. To compare her reception to theirs, I hope to use a prototype version of Megan Peiser’s in-progress Novels Reviewed Database. In both cases, my method will begin with manually researching the three authors’ major works, and then exploring scalable computational methods. The chapter closes, again, with a reflection on Radcliffe as an author.
Chapter five takes the complex methodologies developed in the preceding three chapters, and stress-tests them on More’s difficult publication history. The many Cheap Repository Tracts are difficult to comprehensively identify and attribute authorship to: how have digital resources dealt with these challenges? I am particularly interested in examining publication details which More might have exaggerated for promotional purposes: what grounds can be identified for her claims of exceptional circulation rates? Of particular interest is the fact that More reprinted some Cheap Repository Tracts in different formats for different price points and audiences. Can these differences be captured in the databases I examine? Examining More’s oeuvre also raises questions of literariness: if, as I expect, the Cheap Repository Tracts are excluded from more selective databases, is this appropriate? What kinds of “non-literary” writing is included in each database? This question brings my bibliographic research back home to the core questions about canon-building which drive my inquiry. To this point, I have sought ways to evaluate authors’ popularity and their importance in the print marketplace, as related metrics which underly the authors’ reputations. With More, I explore directly the use of literariness as an inherently unquantifiable metric of selection.
In the following chapters, this dissertation weaves together an exploration of 1790s literature with an exploration of contemporary digital resources. As described in more detail above, chapter two uses Charlotte Smith to introduce the core differences between the databases under consideration, and to examine our conceptions of editions and reprinting. Chapter three uses Mary Robinson, whose printed output is expected to be largely similar in bibliographic terms to Smith’s (that is, they both consist of a large number of publications in a wide range of genres, which were successful enough to sustain a career as a writer), to examine questions about authorship and reception. Chapter four introduces an author who provides a contrast to both Smith and Robinson by producing a small number of titles in only one genre, Ann Radcliffe, prompting deeper inquiry into print runs and reviews, to develop richer metrics for “popularity” or “importance.” Chapter five introduces another contrasting author, of the opposing type, Hannah More, whose large number of publications at varied price points presents a technical challenge for the tools I have developed, and also a theoretical challenge for the concepts of literature I explore. A brief conclusion synthesizes my findings on these four authors, and presents my assessment of how they relate to 1790s literature as a whole.

            <Title>what accuracy is needed?</Title>
            <Text>How accurate does OCR need to be? This depends on how the OCR will then be used. There is a substantial body of existing literature on this subject, which I will survey and integrate here. Thinking in these terms offers a different and sometimes uncomfortable definition for what it might mean to call a text “reliable”. In addition to evaluating the reliability of available OCR copies of Smith’s works, I will evaluate Project Gutenberg’s reliability. Project Gutenberg makes no guarantees of matching any particular edition of a text, and often presents Victorian editions (potentially bowdlerized) without warning, but nonetheless provides texts which are entirely made of actual words: does this make them more, or less, “reliable” than OCR? How can different research questions change that evaluation?</Text>

            <Title>Wordsworth &amp; More</Title>
            <Text>let’s see, looking though my notes — looks like William Wordsworth writes a ton of poems that are just incredibly pretentious versions of Hannah More’s stories/ballads
Alex: “has that been said before. god I hate wordsworth
such a mansplainer
so that would be a great topic”
Michael Gamer has said, essentially, that Wordsworth is writing more pretentious versions of popular ghost stories
Alex: “proving that he is one of those dudes in a meeting who repeats what the woman said but louder
but no one Hannah More especially?”
no, Hannah More hates ghost stories for the same reason Wordsworth does — they are vulgar and unchristian
but she uses them anyway, the same way wordsworth does
to subvert them into morally improving tales
or, well, WW is less clear w/ moral improvement of individual poems
but Gamer makes a compelling argument re: his overall claim to have “elevated” his material
Alex: “is there room to argue against Gamer, or to move it in another direction then?”
I don’t know that More is a specific source for Wordsworth; it’s not impossible, but also not immediately likely to me. What interests me is the similarity of their rhetorical stance toward their material and their shared mission of “elevating” for moral improvement, contrasted with their success — Wordsworth has got everybody buying his propaganda, More not so much
Alex: “well, he is a dude.......
but I see the question, and how it relates to the question about 1790s you have formulated...
certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business.”
hmmm.. Gamer is mostly making a broader argument about the Gothic as the immediate source for Romanticism, whereas More is essentially orthogonal to Romanticism…
(I agree with &amp; really like Gamer’s argument about the Gothic &amp; Romanticism)
More want to repurpose and “elevate” the Gothic for essentially evangelical Christian ends — it is astonishing how much I like her, really, given that she is the perfect precursor to all those meddling Victorian moralist middle-class ladies
Alex: “right, but you are still seeing something new there, about More, that both fits in with an is distinct from Gamer - and is core to your questions about your period”
yeah, I think I would use Gamer as a leaping-off point to pursue this slightly separate track, about other attempts to elevate/repurpose popular writing
Alex: “sounds chapter-able. very good.”</Text>

            <Text>The first three databases I examine will be no surprise to eighteenth-century scholars: ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP. Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), contains over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which 51,965 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 titles in the decade appear in the ESTC but not ECCO). The ESTC does not provide access to texts themselves: instead, it is an authoritative bibliographic catalogue, available as a searchable database. It is ECCO which provides texts: ECCO’s 180,000 titles works are available as photographed facsimiles of the full text of each title. The facsimiles can be searched within ECCO’s online interface; these searches examine a plaintext version of the facsimile pages that was generated by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but this OCR text is not made directly available. As a result, the facsimiles may be read individually by scholars, but cannot form the basis for computational corpus analysis. A subset of ECCO’s texts have been hand-prepared, as part of the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), to be easier to use in computational research. The resulting corpus of ECCO-TCP texts contains 2,231 titles, of which 466 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. These titles are available as carefully edited texts encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard, which not only provides an accurate version of the text’s words, but encodes substantial details regarding its context on the page. Most large scale distant reading of eighteenth-century literature relies on the ECCO-TCP corpus as its ‘model’ or ‘sample’ to represent the period. Accordingly, one of the tasks of this dissertation is to examine the makeup of this corpus, and how it differs both from other corpora and from print culture in the period itself. These three digital collections — ECCO, ESTC, and ECCO-TCP — are the primary digital resources for the period, which form the basis of most digital research. However, they represent only one approach toward the collection and presentation of digital texts, to which there are two broad kinds of alternatives. These large but meticulous collections occupy a middle space between, on the one hand, highly selective thematic collections, such as The Shelley-Godwin Archive, of which there are many, and the giants of indiscriminate textual accumulation, such as Google Books, of which there are few.</Text>

            <Text>On the Grasshopper and Cricket

The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead
In summer luxury,--he has never done
With his delights; for when tired out with fun
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
On a lone winter evening, when the frost
Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

The above sonnet was written in competition with Leigh Hunt.

This is analogue-era scholarship, and concerning a period other than yours, but I think very relevant for some of your groundwork issues. On publishing statistics, DFM is very incisive about the difference between production rates and survival rates, and the tendency of scholars to talk about the first when really the only thing they see is the second. This isn't going to be such a big issue for the 1790s, but it's going to be an issue all the same. He's good on sheet counts and print runs too: the way a fugitive one-sheet broadside in two tiny editions can show up bibliometrically (in an ESTC count, say) as a bigger deal than, or more "popular" than, a fat heavyweight folio in a single edition with a big print run. </Text>

            <Title>DH canon debate</Title>
            <Text>Perhaps indicating that Guillory was correct, twenty years later, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain” (Guillory 265), now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” (“Conjectures” 55) is the problem of conceiving of world literature, rather than the “canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature” (55). His new methods are meant to enable literary studies to examine a new object. The field of distant reading has been moving away from Moretti himself. However, it is still shaped by the attempt to redefine the disciplinary domain of literary studies. In many cases, the new domain is no longer the “canon” but the “corpus,” a collection of texts which are studied en masse for macroanalytical insights. Katherine Bode, for example, in “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading,” argues that Moretti and Matthew Jockers replicate the approaches of New Criticism with their corpora, and calls for “a new scholarly object of analysis” (79) that directly examines historical and textual context of corpora as representations of “literary systems” (97). Lauren Klein, too, treats the textual corpus as the new object of literary analysis requiring curation, contextualization, and interpretation. Her critique argues that “it’s not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading can’t do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so” (n. pag.). Bode, too, despite her strong critique of distant reading as it has been practiced by Moretti and Jockers, does not blame distant reading itself. Distant readers like Moretti and Jockers, she argues, “while claiming direct and objective access to ‘everything,’ … represent and explore only a very limited proportion of the literary system, and do so in an abstract and ahistorical way” (78). Klein, like Bode, calls for “more corpora—more accessible corpora—that perform the work of recovery or resistance” to allow research “beyond quote ‘representative’ samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole” (n. pag.). This framing re-creates, at the site of the corpus, the identical narratives of exclusion and representation which were previously located in critiques of the canon.</Text>

            <Text>“Chapter 4, “Into the Unknown: Literary Anonymity and the Inscription of Reception,” examines conceptions of literary and cultural value operating in colonial Australia by investigating the origins, known and inscribed, of newspaper fiction. It takes as its starting point an acknowledged characteristic of transnational literary culture in this period—anonymous, pseudonymous, and indeterminate authorship—that is nevertheless occluded by the way we study literature in the past: by extracting (predominantly canonical) works from the anonymous conditions under which they were originally published and read. Not only is this strategy impossible when dealing with thousands of works where authorship is unknown, but it treats anonymity and pseudonymity as an absence, rather than a constitutive presence, in literary culture. This approach also ignores the extensive information about authorship contained in the titles, subtitles, and other paratextual and textual components of publication events, whether or not these details align with those of the historical individuals who wrote the works. To avoid these pitfalls, I consider bibliographical designations of authorship as well as how authorship was represented—or inscribed—in newspapers.” (10)

“Anonymous, pseudonymous, and undetermined publications present a conundrum for literary and book historians, not limited to—in fact partly produced by—the field’s focus on authors … most literary histories, and almost all of the scholarly infrastructure they are built upon, privilege the relationship of author and text.” (Bode 85)
“Scholarly editions, library and collection catalogs, bibliographies, special collections, and archives all routinely organize the past, in Meredith McGill’s words, by extracting “anonymous and pseudonymous texts from their disseminated condition.” (Bode 85)

“authorship, in the sense of a definite link between a historical individual and a written text, did not provide the organizing framework for colonial newspaper fiction.” (Bode 89)
There’s something interesting about how she raises interpretive difficulties and then definitively answering them, without fully acknowledging that move: “Should the many author names composed only of initials—“G.A.W.,” “G.B.,” “G.B.W.,” “G.E.C.”—be considered attributions? Is the use of initials intended to conceal the author’s identity; to be decipherable only to certain individuals, or even to a range of readers at a designated place or time; or all of the above, in different instances?” (Bode 88) ““Pseudonymous” incorporates both obvious and discovered pseudonyms as well as titles attributed to an author name composed of initials only” (Bode 90)

This is a totally inadequate gloss which does not compensate for the failings of the graph: “As very little fiction was discovered prior to 1865, those proportional results—and their unevenness—should be interpreted with that scarcity in mind.” (Bode 90), discussing Figure 3

What to do about authors who still don’t have attribution? “The most obvious—because adopted in many literary histories—is to consider only the 62 percent of titles with authors whose identities have been ascertained. … [but] known authors do not necessarily provide a reliable basis for generalizing about fiction. Authors whose names have been preserved through history or recovered by contemporary scholarship are, by definition, not a random sample. … “More generally, studying literature through the lens of authors whose identities are known today preconditions us to view the past through contemporary parameters.” (Bode 91)

Proposes “A shift away from authorship as an organizing category for reading and scholarship” (Bode 93)

“Because these different forms of authorship can and do contradict each other—indeed, that is the premise of many feminist studies of pseudonyms—the two datasets cannot simply be combined. Either known or inscribed authorship, and hence, the conditions of either production or reception, would need to be privileged;Page 95 → even then, the two datasets would potentially work against each other to produce unreliable answers to either type of question.” (94-5)

“Analyzing known and inscribed authorship indicates gender and national trends that contradict prevailing conceptions of nineteenth-century fiction, as it is understood to have appeared in colonial newspapers and more broadly. Both authorship models demonstrate substantially fewer stories by women/“women” in these newspapers than current understandings of the gendering of nineteenth-century periodical fiction would imply. There is also considerably more local writing than would be anticipated based on a core argument of the “transnational turn” in Australian literary studies: that colonial readers overwhelmingly preferred overseas, mainly British, fiction.” (98)

“Figure 5 presents gender proportions over time, with the solid and dotted lines indicating known and inscribed authorship, respectively. Bars depict the proportions of all titles inscribed as “male” or “female”; their relatively small size reinforces the point that the author—including the author’s gender—was not the primary framework through which colonial newspaper fiction was presented or perceived” (98)
#
(This is a pretty mediocre chart — very hard to read, esp re what “female” vs female means)

“The first of these trends implies that, when acquiring British and American fiction, editors deliberately chose rarer, male-authored titles over more common, female-authored ones. The latter trend—especially the consistently higher rate of titles inscribed as “male” authored than known to be so—suggests that editors were keener to advertise male than female writers.”(99) ??? This only follows if women, baseline, produced more fiction — are we sure that’s true?
“Figure 5 also shows growth in fiction by women (and “women”) over time. This is the opposite trend to that described in other Anglophone markets, where male authorship is understood to increase over the nineteenth century as fiction writing became more prestigious” (99)

“If we accept that a title was more likely to be attributed to an individual when its authorship was perceived as important or prestigious, gender trends in attribution—specifically, whether authors known to be male or female were represented as such—can be used to explore editorial assumptions about readerly interest. Comparing known and inscribed gender trends reinforces the claim that editors believed Page 100 →their readers would be particularly interested in men’s writing: fiction by known men was substantially more likely to be attributed to them (69 percent) than was fiction by known women (57 percent), and less likely to be published pseudonymously (10 versus 15 percent) or to be unattributed (21 versus 27 percent). ” (99-100)
This REALLY sounds like she is overstating relatively small differences in percentages. Why does she consider this “substantially” more likely?
“Although the practice was surprisingly uncommon in either direction, where the gender of the author is known and a gender was inscribed, fiction by women was over ten times more likely to be published with a male pseudonym than vice versa.” (100)

Charts are even worse when she talks about nation of origin

“As late as 1891, the non-Indigenous population of all the Australian colonies was 3.24 million. The United Kingdom’s population was more than ten times greater, at approximately 35 million, with America’s population almost twice that again, at 63 million. Given this disparity in population sizes, the finding that colonial authors contributed half as many titles as British writers, and more fiction than American authors, Page 102 →reinforces the significance of their contribution to extended fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers.” (101-2)
This does a better job of contextualizing numbers / implying a naive hypothesis

British and Australian stories had their origins inscribed accurately, whereas American stories might be listed as British, or left uninscribed (103). This helps with her argument that readers were interested n British or Australian fiction, though I also find myself wondering about what she means by “inscribed”

“As trends in known and inscribed authorship indicate, colonial newspapers were much more oriented to men’s writing than was the case in Britain or America.27 Australian fiction also had a greater local presence than has been recognized—particularly in the decade after Smith’s pronouncement—and was published in such a way as to foreground rather than to conceal its origins.” (121)
“27Unless researchers are mistaken about dynamics relating to gender and nationality in British and American periodicals, for conceptions of such phenomena are largely based on the same approaches that produced a view of Australian newspaper fiction as predominantly British: studies of specific—usually canonical—authors; contemporaneous anecdote; and sampling of particular (often “small” or literary) magazines.” (220)

“Perhaps Smith’s comment [on the dominance of British writing] is simply a coincidence of the place and time in which he was writing: not only in a metropolitan context for a metropolitan audience, but on the very cusp of what would be the embrace and development of Australian fiction by provincial newspapers. Contemporary scholarly accounts of colonial readers rejecting local writing and the absence of an Australian literary tradition do not have this excuse of timing. But they have been looking in the wrong place: in the pages of the metropolitan newspapers that have received the vast majority of the critical attention rather than those of the provincial newspapers that published the majority of the fiction.” (121)

“Treating literary anonymity as a distinctive presence rather than an absence, and exploring the phenomenon at scale, chapter 4 highlights its operation along a spectrum. I use the extensive information about authorship contained in Page 201 →the paratext of stories to investigate the cultural meanings attributed to fiction, and thus to contrast the value conferred on British fiction in the colonial context with the cultural marginality of American writing. ” (200-201)

“Determining if the opening paragraphs of hundreds of works indicate a national origin was clearly time consuming. Stanford’s Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel, Grenager, and Manning), employed to develop the stop-words list for chapter 6, might have offered an automated solution to this problem but would not have helped—and would, in fact, have created inaccurate inscriptions—for stories that cite locations but where contextual features indicate the narrative perspective is foreign to that place. Deciding which references should be considered indicative of a story’s origins was also complicated. For instance, should stories prominently set in a manor house, or referencing lords and ladies, be inscribed as British? In these and other instances I decided such references were not unambiguously indicative of national origin.” (218)</Text>

            <Text>Instead, I look at a set of larger archives of more contested “scholarly” status: Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. Google Books may be the most infamous database of books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly accurate metadata collected about them. These rapidly scanned books are prone to unpredictable errors, including inaccurate dates, misspellings, duplicate copies, and inaccurate subject classifications — infamously, many books have “1899” assigned as their publication date because this date was used as a placeholder for “no date”. Nonetheless, Google Books is frequently used to study the prevalence of various “n-grams” (words or short phrases) over time, thanks to Google’s built in tool. The tool is able to search books which are, for copyright restrictions, not available directly to readers, making it highly tempting for questions about contemporary language use.</Text>

            <Text>George Taylor, in The French Revolution and the London Stage, sets forth some key contentions about literature’s cultural capital. He argues that although eighteenth-century critics sought to make distinctions in the social value of different plays, or different parts of the theatrical program at a single show, audiences did not make these distinctions. “Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery,” he argues, the division was purely physical: “all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all […] all received plaudits from all corners of the house” (3). Although reviewers in the eighteenth century sought to police class boundaries in their discussions of the theatre, these critiques operated like the critiques of Gothic fiction which Gamer analyzes: [SUM THEM UP AGAIN HERE.]</Text>

            <Title>ch 2 - fame and legacy</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “seriousness” of their reputations. Influenced by Ashley J. Cross’s “From Lyrical Ballads to Lyrical Tales: Mary Robinson's Reputation and the Problem of Literary Debt,” I am interested in exploring the careers of Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as my “case study” for this chapter. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for “popularity,” “celebrity,” and “legacy” which are both fruitful and nuanced. In addition to reading the extensive literature grappling with these concerns for individual authors, I am currently thinking of ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. I may also add scholarly uptake (perhaps through the proxy of  JSTOR articles, since JSTOR makes their archive accessible for experiments of this type) as a particular sub-type of “legacy.”</Text>

            <Text>Hannah More – poet, playwright, essayist, and tract writer – was destined to teach. From the precocious student of Latin and mathematics in Stapleton and the junior teacher at her sisters’ Park Street school in Bristol to the lionized Evangelical reformer identified with Abolitionist and anti-Jacobin causes, she became recognized as ‘the most influential female philanthropist of her day’1 and one of its most financially successful women writers. Success and service went hand in hand: her will bequeathed ‘the very substantial sum of £27,500’ with most of the money directed ‘to about 200 selected charities’.2 Innate gifts and social conditions worked in tandem to shape and speed her career; she rose to prominence at a time particularly conducive to her talents and national loyalties, both of which were rooted in her confessional identity and deep commitment to political stability. More’s renown coincided with the end of the Republic of Letters, an imagined, international, travelling scholarly congregation where discourse was often cross-gendered and multilingual and where, ironically, she would have felt at home. How- ever, as Peter Burke explicates with his analyses of the geographies of know- ledge in the late eighteenth century, there are two reasons for the end of this community of letters: ‘specialization and nationalism’,3 involving the rise of a sense of identity defined against other disciplines and other nations. Such a shift from cosmopolitanism to nationalism signalled the closing of this kind of intellectual free trade and harmony. Specialization would likely have been less attractive to such a voracious, endlessly curious reader as More; how- ever, the appeal of national and religiously inspired pride, especially in light of her opposition to revolution on the Continent, was ready-made. (Demers 106)
In current scholarly discourse, the prominence of religion in a novel ostensibly concerned with the choice of ‘a suitably moral partner’15 can be / discomfiting and perplexing. More’s close-to-perfect fictional figures lead Mark Canuel to comment on the absence of any ‘discernible characters’.16 Yet commentary also directs attention to the novel’s political and ideological resonance and its bold, at times dialogic, engagement with Evangelicalism. Andrew Heisel is forced to acknowledge More’s ‘narrowed’ characters, who ‘almost in spite of themselves and their readers convey vital moral truth’.17 Lisa Wood reads the novel as ‘a manual for maximizing the religious and antirevolutionary potential of the domestic circle’ with the narrator representing ‘an Evangelical form of domestic masculinity’.18 While Anne Stott positions the rational and humane education which the novel promotes within the ‘British Christian Enlightenment’,19 Kerry Sinanan goes as far as to label the ‘Evangelical sincerity in Cœlebs ... more radical’, since More’s duty is ‘a strategic means to engage with an imperfectible world’ through characters whose ‘striving to act out of a moral sense is active’.20 Focusing on the role of conversation in this novel, Jon Mee credits More with a willingness to ‘countenance “collision” in conversation when it comes in the defense of the truth of Christian values’.21 But only in a few instances do such collisions effect real change or injury and result in repair or reform. (107-8)
”Writing for More is primarily a mode of instruction, whether in poetry, drama, essay, or tract, conveying either a female or a male voice of authority.” (Demers 109)</Text>

            <Text>Analysis of poets’ work often doubles as an analysis of their success or failure in the pursuit of cultural capital. For example, Simon Bainbridge, in British Poetry and the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, sees the decade and its poetry through the lens of war. His own interest is in what he terms “the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott” (3). This framework leads Bainbridge to examine Charlotte Smith alongside Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey, and eventually Walter Scott. In his conception of ‘a national bard’ he imagines a particular marriage of poetry’s special status as imaginative literature to a specific poet’s cultivation of a nationally important public persona. Both poetry and the poet are thus pursuing a particular kind of cultural capital that allows them to rise above their own popularity.

            <Title>Bode close &amp; distant</Title>
            <Text>Bode’s article “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading” sets out to explain how distant reading, as a particularly headline-grabbing subset of DH, became so firmly associated, especially in the minds of its critics, with “the view of distant reading as enabling direct and objective access to a comprehensive literary-historical record.” (78) Bode contends that the exaggerated vision of distant readers who finally discover literary truths without getting bogged down by the pesky details of actual books — oracles who deliver scientific objectivity to rescue literature from its messiness — is not a vision wholly fabricated by media outlets and naysayers, but one fostered by the most prominent distant readers’ unacknowledged New Critical roots. Bode’s extended analysis of Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers’ work contends that they “take the core premise of the New Criticism – that the text is the source of all meaning – to an extreme conclusion” (91) by relying on the accumulated contents of works of literature to explain the history of literary production. In the “Slaughterhouse of Literature” chapter of Distant Reading, for example, Moretti asks why Arthur Conan Doyle has become the canonized figurehead of early detective fiction. The mechanism for canonization that he proposes is that readers chose to continue reading Doyle over the years, in preference to other mystery writers, thus keeping Doyle “alive”; they made their selection based on formal features of Doyle’s stories; and specifically, Moretti suggests, they selected for the formal feature of “decodable clues.” Bode takes issue with this line of reasoning from its very first step: “Moretti takes as transparently true the idea that authors who have a canonical status in the present were selected from the time of first publication,” an assumption immediately countered by, for example, the relatively small readerships for five of the “big six” Romantic poets (90). Then, Moretti’s assumption relies on taking a historical, social process (cultural capital accruing to “canonical” works in different periods), and translating it into a purely formal, textual phenomenon to be observed directly within the work itself. Bode’s final critique is about New Criticism directly, but applies equally well to this version of distant reading: 
…the assumption that literary works are texts, and that texts are single, stable, and self-evident entities, dismisses the documentary record’s multiplicity, and with it the critical contributions of those disciplines (particularly bibliography and scholarly editing) that are dedicated to investigating that multiplicity. (92)
What Bode reveals, then, is that the monolithic concept of “data” can (as Drucker says) “[collapse] the critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation” (1) with seductive ease regardless of whether visualization has been involved.</Text>

            <Title>why Guillory matters to me</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation takes “the literary canon” as its primary urgent problem. “The Digital Humanities” often presents itself as a solution to, or a way to sidestep, the presumed exclusionist logic of “the literary canon.”

Like Guillory, I reject the ‘exclusion hypothesis’ of explaining canon formation.
“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon.” (16)
“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The "means" in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)

DH scholars often call for a reconception of the object of literary study, or of the category of ‘literature’ — I agree, but want to do this in a way that focalizes class, as Guillory does
“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)
This is why DH scholars thing DH can ‘solve’ literary canons, but also how DH can fail: “The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)

Technical literacy can be its own barrier. But honestly, this is just still true about schools, and still important/relevant. The “public humanities” can be viewed with suspicion, as perhaps unscholarly or dangerous, because they try to make literature easy/accessible
“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education … as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (329-330)
"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction.” (340) — if a ‘canonical’ work is experienced as pleasurable this challenges the paradigm

I use the 1790s to figure out this stuff because the 1790s have a LOT of canon-related baggage, as Guillory focalizes
“the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel. Wordsworth and Coleridge responded to this crisis with a programmatic attempt to reaffirm the High Cultural status of traditional canonical works in English against, on the one hand, popular novels and narrative poetry, and, on the other, the quasi-Latinate "poetic diction" supposed to have characterized especially the work of Gray. The effect of that program, which was of course shared by a literary culture much larger than the circle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was to reserve the term "literature" for High Canonical works, and in this way to maintain the cultural capital of those works.”” (Xi)

I… think I reject the concept of ‘the literary’?
“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)

I bring Guillory’s mode of analysis into the digital age by exploring how ‘access’ has continued to be, in altered form, the ‘logic’ of literary debates. DH’s utopian drive comes from the idea of universalizing access, providing the real change in material circumstances that Guillory says is needed. Our limitations come from the way that we limit access in different places, now.
Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (Qtd in Guillory 339-340)
	⁃	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)

I agree with Guillory about the “crisis of the humanities”. DH promises to save the humanities by rescuing its market value, by aligning it with marketable technical skills. This might work but also I HATE it.
“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)

            <Text>“Over the past decade, I have gradually lost confidence that the broad outlines of the literary past are as well known as I once thought. As scholars have learned to compare thousands of volumes at a time, we have stumbled onto broad, century- spanning trends that are not described in textbooks and not explained by period concepts. It is becoming clear that we have narrated literary history as a sequence of discrete movements and periods because chunks of that size are about as much of the past as a single person could remember and discuss at one time. Apparently, longer arcs of change have been hidden from us by their sheer scale” (ix)
“arguments limited by a single reader’s memory can’t reveal the largest patterns organizing literary history.” (x)

“The work described here owes something to twentieth- century projects like book history, stylistics, and the sociology of literature, as well as to the more recent fusion of those projects that goes under Franco Moretti’s term “distant reading.”” (x)

“e second set of misunderstandings I want to address at the outset involves a polemical denition of “distant reading” that Franco Moretti advanced about nineteen years ago. I have em-braced the term “distant reading” because it is apt, and because I am wary of the academic tendency to simultaneously disavow and appropriate the past by rebranding it. (“Everyone knows that distant reading was naïve, but I have invented critical distant reading, which is quite another matter!”) Endless rebranding is tiresome. However, it needs to be said that the way to evaluate distant reading, in , is to look at the results recently produced by a growing community of scholars— not to stage a debate with a speculative rationale for this project that Franco Moretti put forward in the year 2000.”(xix)


Moretti was not the first scholar to propose exploring the literary past with social- scientific methods and digital texts. Similar projects, infeected by corpus linguistics, sociology, and book his-tory, were already under way in the 1980s and 1990s. The project accelerated dramatically at the beginning of this century, fueled [start page xx] by a set of social and conceptual innovations that could support large- scale research (digital libraries, for instance, and machine learning). But few of those factors were visible to most literary scholars in the year 2000. Instead, distant reading was initially understood as an extension of the canon-expanding recovery projects of the 1990s. This gave the enterprise a moral claim on scholars’ attention. If you didn’t do distant reading, you were presumably ignoring the cries of thousands of volumes forgotten in “the slaughterhouse of literature.”
Nineteen years later, the project of large- scale literary history is still often called distant reading because the phrase is vivid and appropriate. But the project has outgrown the polemics that originally accompanied its name. For instance, Moretti’s emphasis on the moral urgency of recovery prompted many skeptics to reply that digital libraries themselves still exclude many volumes that are either lost or simply not digitized. No collection, however large, can save every work from the slaughterhouse. This is true. It is also not an objection to contemporary practices of distant reading, which usually work with explicitly limited samples. The point of distant reading is not to recover a complete archive of all published works but to understand the contrast between samples drawn from different periods or social contexts.
In this and many other ways, distant readers and their critics are often simply talking past each other. Quantitative approaches to literary history have been quite productive, but the results they have produced are not the results predicted by their most notorious manifestoes. The differences between the canon and the slaughterhouse, for instance, turn out not to be enormous. Prominent and obscure writers are often moving in roughly the same direction. [Underwood cites “Canon/Archive. Large- Scale Dynamics in the Literary Field,” Stanford  Literary Lab] But in expanding the scope of their analyses, distant [start page xxi] readers have stumbled onto long historical arcs that change what we thought we knew about both groups of writers, canonical and obscure.
It is time for this conversation to refocus. Distant readers need new manifestoes that provoke critics to respond to what they have actually done— which might be even more interest-ing than what they had promised to do two decades ago. This book re focuses the conversation in one of several possible ways, by shifting emphasis from sheer archival comprehensiveness to the sweep of long timelines.”</Text>

            <Title>closeness / interest</Title>
            <Text>Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistance. Felski describes this as “a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance -- a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments.” As a scholarly practice to demonstrate this closeness, Felski gestures towards what she terms “neophenomenology,” “a sustained attention to the sheer range and complexity of aesthetic experiences, including moments of recognition, enchantment, shock, and knowledge.” Felski has begun this work by establishing a greater richness for the vocabulary of “identifying” with characters. Determining whether a character is “relatable” enough to “identify with” is often a key concern for undergraduate readers and for 18thC thinkers: Felski distinguishes literary itentification into at least three types, “structural or formal alignment, moral allegiance, and emotional empathy,” which could be useful for untangling the allegiance required of different works of sentimental literature. Felski thus begins to locate “post-critical, rather than uncritical” forms of “serious thinking” which could both shed light on and be modified by eighteenth-century practices.</Text>

            <Title>HathiTrust</Title>
            <Text>What makes Google Books of interest in the context of this dissertation is its relationship to HathiTrust, an increasingly popular resource for scholars. HathiTrust’s collection contains digitized content from “a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house member institution initiatives.” The “in-house member institutions” include one hundred and fifty-five universities, colleges, and consortia of universities. The aggregate scholarly authority of these institutions carries the weight of elevating HathiTrust above the Google Books scans which form the backbone of much of its contents: “The members ensure the reliability and efficiency of the digital library,” the website assures us, “by relying on community standards and best practices.” The texts themselves are stored in the database as facsimile page images and full-text OCR transcripts. In order to comply with copyright law, however, HathiTrust only provides large scale downloads and OCR transcripts for texts which are in the public domain. Most scholars use HathiTrust to run experiments on OCR transcripts of copyrighted texts, which they can only access through computational workarounds that intentionally make it impossible for the scholar to see the full transcript itself. These tools provide a unique solution to real barriers for digital scholars of contemporary literature: although copyright law would make it prohibitively expensive or even impossible to build corpora of post-1920s literature, HathiTrust’s mediated access to these texts enables corpus analysis. Through its collection, HathiTrust provides a hodgepodge of texts, of often unverifiable provenance and accuracy, selected largely by happenstance and convenience in a quest to contain all printed books. Through its tools, however, and through its institutional affiliations, HathiTrust has acquired a cultural capital among scholars which Google Books still lacks.</Text>
            <Comments>For example, it might be able to acquire a text document with all of the words of a novel, but sorted into alphabetic order: such a text file can be used for some analyses based on word-frequency, but cannot be read. Or, it might be possible to find collocations of where a given word appears, but with only a limited number of words of context on either side of the term in question. Or, scholars can run pre-written code provided by HathiTrust to carry out things like topic modelling on the full, intact texts of their chosen works, but without being able to inspect those texts or run their own code on them. All of these modes of analysis make research much more difficult to carry out, and nearly impossible to verify. In the study of contemporary copyrighted literature, however, even these very limited tools for corpus analysis are valuable.</Comments>

            <Text>The syllabus of “theory” is a new canon
	•	“Theory's suspension of the category of the literary, institutionalized as the inclusion of nonliterary works in its syllabus, might seem in a narrow sense more radical than a movement to open the canon to minority works that remain, after all, literary works" (176)
	•	“what unifies the syllabus which includes (among others) Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, or Nietzche, Freud, Saussure, and Heidegger, is the fact that these oeuvres can be taken to embody a discourse of mastery, which is always by definition an imitable discourse." (203)
	•	“The names which circulate as ‘theory' in this canonical sense are actually very few in number, much more restricted a list than that which constitutes ‘canonical' literary work. Furthermore the very canonical organization of these texts, their recategorization as 'theory', has the effect of neutralizing the generic, disciplinary, and ideological differences between them in much the same way that the literary canon tends to define all canonical literary texts as the embodiment of a single quality of 'literariness’.” (203)
	•	theory introduces to grad pedagogy "a syllabus whose symptomatic function is to signify precisely methodological 'rigor,' rather than the taste or discrimination which for so long determined the ideological protocols of literary criticism.” (260)

Theory addressing the irrelevance of literature
	•	“Althusser suggests that a symptomatic reading of a text reveals that the text provides an answer to a question which does not itself appear in the text.” (180) … de Man does ask “what is literature?” but the real question he answers (with “rhetoricism”) is "what shall replace literary criticism as it was formerly practiced, [ie] as the appreciative interpretation of the syllabus of 'literary’ works?” (180)
	•	“I will attempt to read this problem as the failure of de Manian theory (and theory in general) to function as anything other than an interim, imaginary solution to the new conditions of intellectual labor, conditions that will certainly require a thorough rethinking of what it is that literary critics do in the classroom and in their writing. In the meanwhile we can say that the reconstruction of criticism as a ‘technical' practice revealed the intrinsic inadequacy of the literary syllabus as the object of that intellectual labor; hence the ‘rigor' of theory had to be embodied not in literary works but in the philosophical or other nonliterary texts supplementing that syllabus. It is these works, the 'canon of theory,' which signify rigor." (181)
	•	"The larger question, for which I shall attempt to provide a properly sociological analysis in the latter part of this chapter, is why the literary critical profession should now require a canon which signifies in its totality a discourse of mastery, in addition to the traditional 'literary' canon, whose significance, as we shall see, is considerably altered by its interrelation with the theory-canon." (203)
	•	theory has become “work on a set of problems that concern all critics” (26), working on "the problem of 'specialization,' or the effects of the technobureaucratic organization of labor on the discipline of criticism" (261)
	•	grad seminars offer unique freedom for theory to appear, but “The indifference of university administrators to the graduate curriculum reflects less their respect for the traditional autonomy of the graduate teacher as it does an accurate estimation of the diminished significance of the literary curriculum in the context of the university’s perceived social function, the perceived demand for the knowledges it disseminates." (261)
	•	“the hegemony of that technobureaucratic organization of intellectual life which has rendered the literary curriculum socially marginal by transforming the university into the institution designed to produce a new class of technical/managerial specialists possessed of purely technical/managerial knowledge." (261)
	•	schools used to be tasked with "the impossible task of at once democratizing the distribution of knowledges and maintaining class distinctions" but now "the nation-state…no longer requires that a distinctive practice of … language identify a culturally homogenous bourgeoisie. That class has long since been replaced by a culturally heterogenous New Class” (263)
	•	“it is the absence of such a crucial social function which the professors of literature experience as powerlessness in the face of a political entity--the state--which they misrecognize as the source of disempowerment." (263)
	•	“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)

De Manian rigor
	•	rhetorical reading gets its rigor from its ability to produce readings that the reader doesn't want -- but "Let us consider the possibility that nothing is more desirable than that the conclusion of the reading be known in advance" (231)
	•	“The rigor of rhetorical reading is not by any means the rigor of an argument in which the knowledge produced at its conclusion can actually take the reader by surprise." (232)
	•	“The rigor of rhetorical reading is thus more rigor than a science requires: it is the rigor of a prescience, a foreknowledge.” (232)
	•	"As rhetorical reading's most overdetermined concept, rigor facilitates an imaginary reduction of the social totality to the structure of the trope, and it thus permits rhetorical reading to function as a political theory just by virtue of being no more than a theory of literature." (236)
	⁃	“If de Manian deconstruction authorizes no specific political practice, as its critics have been eager to claim, that is beside the point. We should do better to ask why a theory of literature (much less of trope) should imply a political practice." (236)
	⁃	deconstruction responded to an external demand (that the syllabus serve a political purpose) "by imposing a limit to curricular revision, a limit intended to preserve theory as literary theory." (237)

Master/disciple pedagogy and transference
	•	theory relies on "the charismatic persona of the master theorist"; theorists can be recognized as masters by the fact that they have disciples (179)
	⁃	“the institutional position of the master theorist, as the person in whom institutional and personal prestige is ‘blended,’ and in whom the concept of 'autonomy' is maximally overdetermined, was always a condition for the emergence of theory.” (155) 
	⁃	“The increasingly technobureaucratic organization of the professional field of literary criticism was a condition for the emergence of theory, which we can understand in retrospect as the reassertion of charismatic authority in the face of that technobureaucratic domination." (256)
	•	"If the institutional locus of canon formation is the school, and its instrumentality the syllabus, the social relation between teacher and student oddly effaces its institutional conditions in producing nothing less than a kind of love: first the love of the disciple for the master, and then the love for what the master teaches, his 'teaching,' and beyond that, as we shall see, a love for the very texts the master loves." (182)
	•	"By transferring the eros of the transference to the lesson, the transference itself will disappear; it will be terminated. ... And this is to say that nothing will remain of de Man in the lesson, that loving the lesson is not, finally, the same as loving de Man." (185)
	•	“Lacan expresses the problem of psychoanalytic theory's transmission as the thematic of the distinction between science and religion. What the theorist wants (but this is not yet equivalent to the 'desire of the analyst’) is the transmission of theory, that is, the solution to a problem in pedagogy. Whether or not a theory carries with it a claim to scientificity, its transmission would be better assured by its organization in the form of a science” (198)
	•	"the transference onto theory always misses its object, the positive content of theory, by cathecting in and behind that object the image of the master.” (201)
	•	De Man: "What de Man gains tactically by reducing all intersubjective relations to the possibility of cognitive (that is, linguistic) error is the total obliteration of the transference from the terrain of the discussion." (193)
	•	Lacan: Lacan's matheme: “By reducing transmission to a rote process the doctrine was supposed to escape a certain contingency of the transference, its constitutive ambivalence, its love-hate. But the reception of the matheme marked a greater investment in the transference than ever before, even as both master and disciple deferred to the impersonal form of the algorithm.” (202)
	•	“Lacan and de Man appear to set off resolutely on opposite theoretical directions, but ... they end up in the same place, the place of the ‘the subject who is supposed to know.’” (195)
	•	“the teaching of both de Man and Lacan attempts to account and compensate for the vicissitudes of transmission by attributing those vicissitudes to an epistemological defect of language, or by refusing in principle the possibility of the dissolution of the transference. The two positions amount in practice to the same thing." (202)

Summary of de Man
	•	de Man's "terminology produces certain discursive effects. These effects are (1) the conflation of linguistics with rhetoric; (2) the equation of literature with rhetoric; and (3) the reduction of rhetoric to trope." (208)
	•	end result of Early Modern concept of scientific truth creates the idea of "fiction”; in 18thC ”the category of the 'literary' could then be restricted to the fictional genres. The new generic system had to develop a conception of truth proper to its form and the theorization of this truth describes in the largest sense the project of 'Romantic' criticism" (214) … “it is by means of a return to rhetoric that the generic distinction between literary and non-literary texts can be reconceptualized as a linguistic distinction, the problem of 'literary language’” (214)
	•	de Man's reading is thematic; the use of 'tropes’  "permit the methodology to advertise itself as rigorously rhetorical or non-thematic” (227)
	•	for de Man “metaphor and metonymy mean necessity and chance” (227)
	•	“de Man's argument is that departments of literature have denied their institutional identity as departments; they have constructed an institutional self-image which devalues their own purely institutional functions. Against such institutionalized anti-institutionalism de Man proposes a thorough reinvestment in the form of the department, as the basic structural unit of the university.” which means no longer being 'large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter' but instead ‘much smaller units, dedicated to.. professional specialization’ (247)

            <Text>Smaller collections allow for more scholarly curation, but have corresponding limitations. Whereas the ‘main players’ of the the mega-archives can be easily enumerated, these specialized collections are numerous. Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle (1,950 references to fiction in issues from 1772-1829), the Index to the Lady’s Magazine (14,729 articles from 1770 to 1818), or the Novels Reviewed Database (1,836 reviews from The Critical Review and The Monthly Review, 1790-1820). Feminist scholarship in particular has seen the creation of resources like the Orlando Project, the Chawton House library Novels Online, Northeastern University’s Women Writers Online and UC Davis’s British Women Romantic Poets. The virtue of these collections is that they achieve even greater accuracy and comprehensiveness within their defined scope. The Shelley-Godwin Archive, for example, can reasonably aspire to digitize every known manuscript of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, and to provide these manuscripts in hand encoded plaintext transcripts. However, as is inevitable, these specialized archives have the vices of their virtues: their specialized focus allows them to adapt precisely to their materials, and their idiosyncratic data structures can rarely be combined with other resources. The William Blake Archive, for example, benefits enormously from designing its archive around the unique images of each page of each copy of each of Blake’s works. But because this approach is so well suited to Blake, it cannot be applied beyond Blake. Even if the archive’s resources were available for download, they could not be directly compared to materials from another source which does not record its information at such a minute level of detail. As a result, although a great deal of excellent digital scholarship is contained in specialized micro archives, I do not examine them further in this dissertation.</Text>

            <Title>homophily</Title>
            <Text>Wendy Chun suggests that the problem with much algorithmic inquiry lies in its most core assumption: the insistence that the future must look like the past \cite{Chun:2018tq}. This assumption is essential to any system which exclusively bases its predictions on past data. It is particularly intertwined with what Chun calls “homophily,” “the axiom that similarity breeds connection—which grounds contemporary network science” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.60}. Homophily, as it is currently applied to network science, Chun argues, both “assumes and creates segregation” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.76} in a fashion that allows it to operate “like money laundering for bias” \cite{Chun:2018tq pp.62-63}. Importantly, however, the analogy to money laundering is imperfect: it cannot be resolved with “better, cleaner data” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.64}. Instead, Chun insists, “new theories of connection—which do not presume a dangerously banal and reciprocal notion of friendship—are needed” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.89}, a call to action which places its emphasis not on the information provided to an algorithm but on the algorithm’s procedures.</Text>

            <Title>Richardson - PG Books Are Real</Title>
            <Text>The talk on adding PG book to the NYPL’s collection begins with “We all know Project Gutenberg, we all use Project Gutenberg in our demo applications we present here, we read the books.”
“I’m sure you already know that the text of a Project Gutenberg books is … a very high quality text.”
But “Project Gutenberg does not play by the rules of the publishing industry, it plays by the rules of the internet.”
“Project Gutenberg puts out books with no regard for whether there’s a market for the book, whether there’s an audience of people who will read it. I think this is great, but it does complicate the situation for a library. The reason project Gutenberg can get away with this— well, it’s a volunteer project, they can do what they want— the reason it works is because the Project Gutenberg search experience is great.” If you put a book title into a search engine, google will show you the PG edition of that book. But the browse experience is lousy: “If you don’t know the exact book you are looking for, the experience is really lousy.”
The library pays money to other people who did the annoying work of mirroring PG books and repackaging them, purchasing access to public domain books: “We pay to license DRM encumbered editions of public domain materials, most of which were originally sourced from Project Gutenberg.

He measured the ‘classicness’ of books by looking at OCLC data on how many editions of the book have been published and how many library holdings they have. “When we think about classic books, we think of a book whose enduring popularity allows us to think of the popularity as a synonym for quality.”

“Project Gutenberg, it’s a firehose, there’s a ton of books in here, most of the books are bad— but guess what, the same thing is true of commercial publishing. And this is the job of the library, it is to get control of the output of publishing and figure out which book is the right book for this patron.”

On the slide: “Project Gutenberg is a firehose with a huge backlog. But so is commercial publishing! The circulating library’s job is to master the firehose and match readers to books. Gutenberg books are more difficult to integrate, but the readers are there and the price is right.”

In Q&amp;A, re applying the “classics” metrics to other books: “When you get away from classics, the notions of popularity and quality become disconnected. Which is not to be snobs and we won’t lend out books that are popular which we don’t think are very good, we certainly will do that because that’s what people want, but they need to be measured separately. If a book is like that, we need to know why we’re lending it out, are we doing it because it’s super popular but mediocre or because it’s popular and good.”

Abstract: “Although Project Gutenberg provides a good amount of RDF metadata for each of its publications, the metadata most necessary to grab a modern reader’s attention–a summary and a nice-looking cover–is almost always missing. Without putting restrictions on Project Gutenberg, which is extraordinarily successful at what it does, how can we present its results in a way that appeals to our patrons and customers?”</Text>

            <Title>winnowing down (4 dbs)</Title>
            <Text>Figure &lt;$n#fig:Smith-4dbs-alluvial&gt; shows how Smith’s presence in four major databases has the effect of winnowing down her full output arbitrarily. Even the largest collection, the 42 editions included in the ESTC, is not comprehensive: since the ESTC does not include any works published after 1800, it excludes volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802), three works for children (Conversations, Introducing Poetry, 1804; History of England, 1806; and Natural History of Birds, 1807), and the posthumous publication that now forms a major part of Smith’s reputation as a poet, Beachy Head (1807). ECCO lacks these five editions for the same reason, and is also missing five others: the first and ninth editions of Elegiac Sonnets (1784 and 1800), the second edition of The Banished Man (1795), the first edition of Minor Morals (1798), and the second edition of Rambles Farther (1800).
HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith’s 47 editions, though these are not a simple subset of the ESTC and ECCO. Unlike the ESTC and ECCO, HathiTrust contains volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802). This is the only post-1800 work which appears in HathiTrust, however— the others are also missing, including the important volume Beachy Head (1807). There is one work included in HathiTrust but not in ECCO, the second edition of The Banished Man (1795). Whereas ECCO does not include works unless there is a complete copy available, HathiTrust provides scans of volumes 2, 3, and 4, and simply implies through their numbering that there is a missing first volume — perhaps in the optimism that a volume 1 will appear from another library’s holdings, to complete the set later. The remaining HathiTrust included titles appear in both the ESTC and ECCO, and a further 21 titles appear as facsimiles in ECCO but not in HathiTrust. At first blush it is somewhat surprising that HathiTrust has failed to include works which are, demonstrably, in known locations at institutional libraries, and in physically sound condition to be scanned— but the scans making up HathiTrust bear no relation to the scans in ECCO. The Young Philosopher (1798), for example, appears in ECCO sourced from a British Library copy, but the HathiTrust images are “Google-digitized” from the New York Public Library. Google’s rapacious book-scanning, evidently, was not as thorough as ECCO’s sustained scholarly project.
The smallest subset of all of these texts is the ECCO-TCP holding of just two titles: the second edition of Celestina (1791), and the first edition of The Emigrants (1793). Both titles appear in all larger databases, including HathiTrust (though, as I will discuss, they arrive in HathiTrust from a different source). The Emigrants is included in ECCO-TCP as one file, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the Huntington Library. Celestina is included as four files, one for each of four volumes, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the British Library. Both works were first reproduced in the microfilm version produced 1982-2002 in by Research Publications, then digitized in 2003 (released on ECCO in June 2004), and finally published as TEI XML files in January 2007. The current files have been kept up to date with changes in TEI standards, and were created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl. The bibliographic metadata for these works is the same between ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records. In HathiTrust, however, the source text for The Emigrants is a University of California Library copy, rather than the British Library, scanned by Google Books, and presented with substantially less detailed bibliographic information. The ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records for The Emigrants all provide the same physical description “ix,[3],68[i.e. 60]p. ; 4⁰” with the same note “[n]umbers 9-16 omitted in pagination; text is continuous.” HathiTrust, in contrast, gives the physical description “ix, 68 p. ; 26 cm,” which is both more and less information: a quarto volume could be a range of sizes, so HathiTrust provides new detail by giving a measurement in centimetres, but the data on page numbers is now misleading. Consulting the HathiTrust facsimile shows that it, too, omits the page numbers 9-16, going directly from page 8 to page 17 without a break in the poem. HathiTrust also omits information on the three unnumbered pages between the preface and the poem. Evidently, a human did consult the book, to identify a nine-page preface in roman numerals, and the page number on the last page, but they did not carry out a full collation.</Text>
            <Comments>Why these five?
Volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer are in fact part of the same bibliographic record as the first three volumes. The publication date for the combined five-volume work is listed as “1800-1802.”
Several of HathiTrust’s records provide “mixed copies” like this, with some volumes scanned from one library’s holdings and other volumes scanned at another. If there is overlap, multiple scans will be provided for the duplicated holdings. Nonetheless, all of these scans are tied to a single unified MARC record, taken from only one of the holding library (with no indication of which library provided it).

In Bannet’s book the importance of the French Revolution itself is actually minimised, when compared, that is, with the behavioural and attitudinal changes slowly fomented by British women writers across the eighteenth century. But, Bannet argues, the British reactions to the French Revolution nevertheless remain crucial in shaping and re-shaping ideas of domesticity.

            <Text>Frow, John. Genre. New York: Routledge, 2015. Print.
John Frow articulates genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.</Text>

            <Text>It is increasingly de rigueur for distant reading work to carefully discuss its underlying “corpus building.” The terminology of “corpus building” goes perhaps halfway to the ideal humanistic relationship to knowledge which Drucker and Bode envision. By referring to the process as building, and discussing it as it own methodological step, scholars acknowledge their active intervention in creating the information they will then analyze. In Ted Underwood’s monograph Distant Horizons, for example, he models many different kinds of literature to explore how texts might be distinguished — fiction vs non-fiction; popular vs literary; “genre fiction” in its many forms — and each model is first described in terms of how the definition of each group has been translated into a method of textual selection. [TODO-WRITE: explain how he defines “reviewed” fiction] All of this explicit discussion of corpus building serves to temper the strength of his arguments, cutting off the impossible illusion of “direct and objective access” (Bode “Equivalence” 78).</Text>

            <Title>summary</Title>
            <Text>Flaws in the current canon debate

“two pervasive theoretical assumptions" implicit in the current canon debate: (6)
	1.	term ‘canon’ as replacement for ‘classics’ seeks to critique 'classics’, and treats the “traditional curriculum of literary texts" as equivalent to a closed and normative object akin to the scriptural canon. (6)
	2.	assumed similarity between exclusion (in which social minorities are excluded from power of political representation) and selection (by which some works are deemed canonical and others noncanonical). assumes that the solution is easy, add minorities to canon. (7)

A focus on “representation” as if literary representation was equivalent to political representation
	•	"The literary curriculum is precisely not the side of mass cultural production and consumption, but the critique of the canon has proceeded as though it were, as though canon formation were like the Academy Awards. ... in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site.” (8)

“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
Essentialist assumptions of liberal pluralism:
	•	“The sense in which a canonical author represents a dominant social group, or a noncanonical author a socially defined minority, is continuous with the sense in which the work is perceived to be immediately expressive of the author's experience as a representative member of some social group. ... The author returns in the critique of canon, not as the genius, but as the representative of a social identity.” (10)
	•	"it has seemed necessary to many progressive critics to present certain texts by minority authors as intrinsically noncanonical, as unassimilable to the traditional canon.” (9)

Current canon debate overlooks class
his post-Marxist critique is different from a liberal pluralist critique because he is "insisting on the theoretical and practical incommensurabiliy of the terms race, class, and gender: the modes of domination and exploitation specific to each of these socially defined minorities thus cannot be redressed by the _same_ strategy of representation.” (11)
"The fact of incommensurability explains why the revisionist critique of the canon has in practice been incapable of identifying 'noncanonical' works by lower-class writers who are not already identified by race or gender.” (14)

The “decline of the humanities” is the reduction of literature’s cultural capital

“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)
“If the liberal arts curriculum still survives as the preferred course of study in some elite institutions, this fact has everything to do with the class constituency of these institutions. …it is only those students who belong to the financially secure upper classes who do not feel compelled to acquire professional or technical knowledge as undergraduates." (46)
university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
The actual function of the canon

"The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
	•	"Within the history of canon formation we will always be able to discern the arrangement and rearrangement of (1) an institutional practice, or pedagogy; (2) a body of preserved and disseminated writings, or canon; and (3) a produced linguistic knowledge” (71)
	•	“Canonical texts, institutionally preserved and disseminated, constitute the paradigmatic basis of literary language, the guarantor at the lower educational levels of simple grammatical speech, the exemplar, at higher levels, of more expansive as well as more elite standards of linguistic use (stylistic or rhetorical rather than simply grammatical norms)” (68)
	•	“The school functions as a system of credentialization by which it produces a specific /relation/ to culture. That relation is different for different people, which is to say that it reproduces social relations." (56)
	•	“The educational institution performs the social function of systematically regulating the practices of reading and writing by governing access to the means of literary production as well as to the means of consumption (the knowledge required to read historical works)." (19)
Our current canon creates ‘literary language’ as the mark of distinction
	•	“while the standard or 'common' language seems to efface social stratification by making language itself the vehicle of common national identity, the 'literary’ language reinstates at another level a linguistic difference by which the upper classes can continue to mark their cultural distinction.” (78)
	•	the language taught in composition classes “is employed in its place, the ‘office.’ It is not 'everyday' language.” (79), and “its production bypasses the older literary syllabus altogether.” (79)
	•	“If the term 'literature' can be retained to indicate a transhistorical phenomenon at all, it would have to be defined as the canonical genres of writing, whatever these genres happen to be in any particular time or place, and whatever name may have been given to them collectively. We are speaking, then, of certain genres of writing which become paradigmatic for a socially differentiated speech." (69)

Where canons come from

It’s not the “exclusion” hypothesis
	•	"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the actively excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)
	•	“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon.” (16)
	•	“The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” (15) — yes: and the presence of women in a genre generally made it seem to be ephemeral rather than serious… which isn't QUITE exclusion, but also doesn't seem like it's what Guillory is noting
	•	"the historical process of canon formation, even or especially at the moment of institutional judgment, is too complex to be reduced to determination by the single factor of the social identity of the author” (17) gender may contribute somewhat to the reception of a given author, but it cannot in itself *explain* canonical/noncanonical status
Canons are selected
	•	“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)
	•	"Anyone who studies historical literatures knows that the archive contains an indefinite number of works of manifest cultural interest and accomplishment. While these works might be regarded as 'noncanonical' in some pedagogic contexts -- for example, the context of the ‘great works’ survey -- their noncanonical status is not necessarily equivalent in anyone's judgment to a zero-degree of interest or value.” (30)
	•	“Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To contend otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
Canons are made from syllabi
	•	"So far from being the case that the canon determines the syllabus in the simple sense that the syllabus is constrained to select only from canonical works, it is much more historically accurate to say that the syllabus posits the existence of the canon as its imaginary totality.” (31)
	•	the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
	•	revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
	•	revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)

How to “open” the canon

Must necessarily modernize it
	•	“the current critique of the canon both discovers, and misrepresents, the obvious fact that the older the literature, the less likely it will be that texts by socially defined minorities exist in sufficient numbers to produce a 'representative' canon" (15) —  but is this ACTUALLY true??
	•	“Obviously in order to ‘open' this canon, one would have to modernize it, to displace the preponderance of works from earlier to later. And there are of course many good reasons to do so. The pressure to modernize the curriculum has succeeded again and again” (32)
	•	"The fact that we no longer read these [classical] works in Greek or Latin, or that we read far fewer classical Greek or Latin works than students of premodern school systems, represents a real loss; but this loss must be reckoned as the price of the /integration/ of these works into a modern curriculum. The inevitable loss of older works in any humanities curriculum…is the result, as we have observed, of the /absolute/ accumulation of cultural works.” (51)
Present “minority works” as valuable literary history, not “representation” or subversion
	•	“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works [by minorities] because they are important and significant cultural works. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
But really, the goal is to address unequal access to cultural capital
	•	"A politically effective critique of literary education would be better served now by discarding the problematic of representation for a problematic whose object is the systematic constitution and distribution of cultural capital. For if social groups now imagine that they are too different to speak the same language, or to be represented by the same cultural works in the schools, they are nevertheless always exchanging the same currency, even in the symbolic form of cultural capital.” (82)

Chapter one “argues that there can be no /general/ theory of canon formation that would predict or account for the canonization of any particular work, without specifying first the unique historical conditions of that work's production and reception. Neither the social identity of the author for the work's proclaimed or tacit ideological messages definitively explain canonical status. If this were not true, ideologically heterodox works would never achieve canonicity, nor would writing produced by any member of a socially defined minority.” (85) It's the “task of the school, not of works themselves" to assimilate a range of works. (85)

“The preliminary remarks on the question of value in Chapter 1 argue that the process of canon formation cannot be reduced to acts of evaluation in the simple sense of affirming or rejecting the specific values assumed to be expressed in a literary work. … the institution which is the historical site of these evaluative acts--the school--subordinates specific values expressed in works to the social functions and institutional aims of the school itself. It is only when presented as canonical, as the cultural capital of the schools, that individual literary works can be made to serve the school's social function of regulating access to these forms of capital.” (269)</Text>

            <Title>Special Fields list rationale</Title>
            <Text>Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’</Text>

            <Title>Scheuermann  - Hannah More and the English Poor </Title>
            <Text>Scheuermann  - Hannah More and the English Poor (2001)
The problem with More is that while she is a most interesting figure, her ideas are largely repugnant to modern sensibilities. Critics often deal with this inconvenience either by apologizing for their subject or by changing what she says so that she seems closer to us in spirit. But although More’s position on social issues is not in harmony with ours, it is entirely representative of her own times. Her full welcome into the most influen- tial circles—she was a Bluestocking and an intimate of Samuel Johnson and his friends—points to this acceptance by her peers. The extraordi- nary sales of her Cheap Repository Tracts attest to the chord she struck in her own society. And when we look at eighteenth-century laws regarding the poor, and contemporary commentary on those Poor Laws, we under- stand just how accurately More reflects the spirit of her time. (237)
More’s most recent biographer, Patricia Demers, makes a charmingly earnest effort “to deal justly with Hannah More,” although that “means admitting both the expansiveness and the limitations of her charity, methodology, and vision.”1 She worries about “how to accord justice” to this woman “who is—and, as some would argue, always was—so devastatingly out of step.... More’s central belief in a natural hierarchical social order...is now angering in its condescension and immobility” (p. 2). More’s work “is now widely assumed to have been a narrow exercise of knowing and keep- / ing one’s place” (p. 11); this line is particularly irritating to feminists: “Feminist criticism has been understandably and rightly severe about More’s dedication to the doctrine of the two spheres and her solemn dis- courses on submission” (p. 21). Gamely, Demers insists that More “is altogether more complex and conflicted than most detracting comments or piecemeal excerpts indicate” (p. 22). Mitzi Myers, delighted to have found a female eighteenth-century writer who was clearly successful, largely re-writes More so that her “didactic” works “scarcely stand second to the canonical novel in interest and importance” in terms of “what they reveal about women.”2 More becomes “a pioneer social novelist” (p. 267), although Myers is talking about short tales. Ignoring entirely the form More used for the tracts, Myers insists that “Transcribing her society’s exigent problems into fiction, More helped give the novel a new seriousness, relevance, and direction” (p. 267). More’s tales, designed to teach the poor to be satisfied with their lot in life and those better off how to help the poor without raising them too much, become in Myers’ reading (237-8)
fresh literary analogues of urgent social awareness; her thematic message of domestic heroism occasions a new domestic realism, ideas and aesthetics are generated from the woman novelist’s characteristic stance. In its complex mix of literary and cultural innovation, More’s Repository illustrates how women’s educative and caretaking role fed into new strains of social fiction, and her work exemplifies how women could translate female ideology’s didactic imperative into an authoritative voice capable of documenting and interpreting historical realities. (p. 268) (238)
Other recent readers fall somewhere between Myers’ and Demers’ readings; Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace, for example, presents a rather strange More who, along with sister Patti, has a morbid response to the physical nature of the poor; much of Kowaleski-Wallace’s discussion centers on “the ‘grotesque’ body” and More’s presumed need to tame it, especially in the poor. In other words, Kowaleski-Wallace, like Myers, reshapes a More who fits her own interests. The very title of her book, in fact, suggests a biased reading: Their Fathers’ Daughters: Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, and Patriarchal Complicity.3 (238)
So the More that contemporary critics discuss is troubling and, in Kowaleski-Wallace’s case, troubled. What we don’t get is much of an eighteenth-century More, and before I get to my own discussion of More’s work—my own discomfort with More’s perspectives apparent at many points—I want to present a context for her ideas by looking first at some aspects of the eighteenth-century’s Poor Laws.  (238)
“More’s assumptions here are central to her view of the compact between rich and poor. If the rich do choose to help the poor, their aid is strictly a matter of voluntary charity. That “kindness” is drawn forth by their own sense of the deserving nature of the individual case.” (246)

            <Text>A core object of study for this dissertation is the makeup and history of contemporary digital databases. Eighteenth-century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes. I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg and HathiTrust. My examination of these six databases will, of necessity, examine a ‘time capsule’ of their holdings at a particular moment; the sources of my data, and my procedures for working with them, are described in more detail in Appendix B (“Methodology”). The databases vary from each other in terms of two main qualities: their size, and their reputation. The reputation of any given digital resource is shaped largely, I argue, by its ability to signal ‘rigour’ in its collection practices. Several databases of different sizes have established reputations of seriousness, and, correspondingly, cultural capital within scholarly communities. The databases that I will examine at length form two groupings of three each, to explore two sets of related concepts. The first set consists of ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP, all of which follow the same rigorous collection practices at different scales. The second set consists of Google Books, HathiTrust, and Project Gutenberg, which follow very different collection practices while sharing a dubious scholarly reputation.</Text>

            <Title>gender package in R</Title>
            <Text>The “gender” package in R is able to draw on a range of historical sources for gender information, but only one is applicable for this project. Most are US-based or only contain information beginning in the nineteenth century (or both). [Or, SHOULD I use ipums…? Will US names differ a lot?]
If no value is specified, then for the "ssa" method it will use the period 1932 to 2012; acceptable years for the SSA method range from 1880 to 2012, but for years before 1930 the IPUMS method is probably more accurate. For the "ipums" method the default range is the period 1789 to 1930, which is also the range of acceptable years. For the "napp" method the default range is the period 1758 to 1910, which is also the range of acceptable years. 

"The "napp" method uses census microdata from Canada, Great Britain, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1801 to 1910 created by the North Atlantic Population Project.” (Mullen, Blevins, and Schmidt)  “For the "napp" method the default range is the period 1758 to 1910, which is also the range of acceptable years.”(Mullen, Blevins, and Schmidt)
“The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) is a machine-readable database of the complete censuses of Canada (1881), Denmark (1787, 1801), Great Britain (1851, 1861, Scotland 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911), Norway (1801, 1865, 1900, 1910), Sweden (1880, 1890, 1900, 1910), the United States (1850, 1880) and Iceland (1703, 1729, 1801, 1901, 1910).” (NAPP)
So actually, NAPP data has nothing relevant to both my time and place. But this may be the same US data that’s in the IPUMS method, so it’s still worth comparing the two.

“The "ipums" method looks up names from the U.S. Census data in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.”(Mullen, Blevins, and Schmidt) “For the "ipums" method the default range is the period 1789 to 1930, which is also the range of acceptable years.”(Mullen, Blevins, and Schmidt)</Text>

This “case study” of a particular decade [allows me to do something something about how collections of texts implicitly create identity-based collectives]



In literary study, scholars increasingly embrace the methods of “distant reading” to study hundreds or thousands of texts using computational tools. As an alternative to “close reading,” distant reading promised an exciting opportunity to expand the borders of which literature would merit serious attention. However, in the nearly twenty years since Franco Moretti coined the term “distant reading” in his “Conjectures on World Literature,” the introduction of computation has not changed the preference for a limited, selective canon. A recent article by Kathleen Bode exemplifies a current shift in digital humanities research. Bode critiques pioneers of distant reading and literary macroanalysis Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they use as proof of their arguments. As an alternative, Bode calls for an integration of computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history, which she terms a “data-rich literary history.” My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799, to redefine our understanding of the definitive works of this decade.

            <Text>Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. My design praxis is informed by the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments. Neither Tufte nor Cairo is a scholar of media studies; rather, they are professional practitioners of ‘data visualization’ who reflect critically on the assumptions of their work. Tufte’s work primarily strives to correct badly designed data visualizations, and the dangerous decisions that bad design can lead people to. His most famous example is an analysis of the engineers’ report at NASA which led to the ill-fated launch of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986: as his extensive visual analysis argues, the engineers (untrained in graphic design) unintentionally obfuscated crucial information about the day’s launch conditions. The poorly designed graphics these engineers produced made the launch appear low risk to their superiors; despite the engineers’ strong warnings, their verbal argument was disregarded in favor of their accidental graphical argument. As Tufte demonstrates, a few simple alterations of their graphic design would have made it obvious that the day’s unprecedentedly cold weather was extremely dangerous, and potentially averted disaster \cite{Tufte:2001vw}. Tufte’s six principles of design primarily seek to guide undertrained designers away from misleading themselves. Cairo, following on Tufte’s work from the perspective of an active journalist, more often turns his attention to successful designs which mislead their audiences intentionally. His forthcoming book, How Charts Lie, addresses the readers of infographics with insights into visual literacy \cite{Cairo:ikIksuMr}. His preceding book, The Truthful Art, addresses the creators of good faith infographics with insights into visual manipulation \cite{Cairo:2016uv}. Cairo draws a distinction between “data visualization” and “infographics”: “an infographic tells the stories that its designer wants to explain, but a data visualization lets people build their own insights based on the evidence provided,” summarized more succinctly as “infographics to explain, data visualizations to explore” \cite{Cairo:2014tl}. Using this terminology, my argument will proceed with infographics in the body of the dissertation as curated figures to support my argument, with fuller data visualizations available in Appendix C (“Data”) to allow further exploration. Following in both Tufte and Cairo’s footsteps, I conceive of the figures throughout this dissertation as rhetorical devices. In service of arguing honestly, therefore, my designs — in the body of the dissertation and in Appendix C — are accompanied by footnoted explanations of my design rationale. </Text>
            <Comments>I cite Tufte and Cairo as the thinkers whose design philosophies best accord with my own current understanding of the work and craft of persuasive data visualization, but my actual practical training as a graphic designer is indebted to Judith Galas, Sonia Davis Gutiérrez, and Tom Hapgood. 
 Tufte is careful not to blame the engineers for being better at engineering and systems analysis than they were at design: rather, this example shows that design is a skill that involves expertise; when designs matter, people with that expertise need to be involved.

            <Title>ch 3 - gender, topics</Title>
            <Text>In chapter three, I intervene in these corpora with code which I have written myself. First, I seek to determine how many of the titles in each database are attributed to men, how many to women, and how many are unsigned or unattributable. I will consider both the authors listed on the title pages and the authors identified by the database itself, since these often differ. This experiment will rely on a small program which assigns a probable gender to each author name. One of the core questions of this dissertation, as discussed, is about the content of the works which are not preserved and distributed by the new structures of canonization which contemporary digital archives create. In this experiment, I ask pointedly: are men preferentially preserved? My second experiment in this chapter is related, as I seek to determine what kinds of writing are included in each corpus. I write a less-simple series of programs in order to make reasonable guesses at the contents of texts, using topic modelling. Topic modelling is a methodology used in computer science to group texts which discuss similar subject matter. It is designed for search engines, and relies on clustering related keywords. Topic modelling is usually applied to long texts: it was designed for news articles or web pages, but literary scholars often apply it to entire novels. Since my work is partly motivated by the unavailability of full digital texts, I apply it to just the title pages of works. In doing so, I take advantage of the eighteenth century’s distinctively rich title conventions. In most decades, a title would not offer enough information to contain multiple ‘topics,’ but in the eighteenth century, the title page doubled as an advertisement, trying to convey as much appealing information as possible about the work’s contents. Once I have created my topic models, I will use them to compare the prevalence of categories like plays, songs, prose romance, histories, poetry, political treatises, and other broad categories of writing. One advantage of using topic modelling, rather than classifying works by hand, is that the clusters of texts will emerge based on the eighteenth century vocabulary for genres. At this stage, however, I do not take any corpus as representative of the ‘true’ distribution of various genres in the eighteenth century print marketplace. Instead, I use these categories in conjunction with my previous identification of authorial gender, to ask: if there are differences in gender distribution between corpora, are they attributable to differences in the kinds of writing which each corpus preferentially preserves? That is to say, if men are over-represented in the smaller and richer corpora which have seen the greatest investment of scholarly resources, is this because those corpora primarily preserve male-dominated categories of writing? Or do they preferentially select male authors from categories which are not male-dominated at the larger scale?</Text>
            <Comments>The automatic attribution of a gender to a name is the sort of thing which would be untenable in a modern corpus, and which is uncomfortable even in the eighteenth century. However, my core question is about how gender is represented on title pages, as a visible component of print culture, rather than about the personal identity of any given author. In that limited context, it seems justifiable to say, for example, that a book attributed to ‘Charlotte Smith’ or ‘the authoress of The Romance of the Forest’ or ‘Mrs. Robinson’ advertises itself as being by a woman. I have been unable to find a first name in my eighteenth century corpora which cannot be assigned an unambiguous gender. Differences between the advertised author gender and what scholars have assigned in the database as the ‘actual’ author gender (as, for example, when Mary Robinson published as Mr. Robinson) will be discussed and theorized when they occur.
For example, a typical title in the English Short Title Catalogue for the decade is “The injustice and impolicy of the slave-trade, and of the slavery of the Africans: illustrated in a sermon preached before the Connecticut Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Persons Unlawfully Holden in Bondage, at their annual meeting in New-Haven, September 15, 1791. / By Jonathan Edwards, D.D. Pastor of a church in New-Haven. ; To which is added, A short sketch of the evidence for the abolition of the slave-trade, delivered before a committee of the British House of Commons.” The usefulness of this title, as an advertisement for (if not necessarily an accurate representative of!) the work’s content, I argue, presents an opportunity unique to the eighteenth century. The eighteenth century is often dismissed as unsuitable for computational distant reading because eighteenth century printed type produces very low-quality OCR transcripts — but a focus on OCR-based distant reading itself seems to me like a response to the poverty of paratextual material in later literature.
Of course, these title pages are not always accurate descriptions, since they might wish to mislead readers to encourage purchases. These disjunctions </Comments>

* pool their resources in order to create full-text resources few could afford individually
* create texts to a common standard suitable for search, display, navigation, and reuse
* collaborate with commercial providers, rather than constantly bargaining and competing with them” (TCP “Welcome”)
Those four named organizers — Michigan, Oxford, ProQuest, and CLIR — are the tip of the iceberg for institutional buy-in. At “Our scholarly partners,” TCP lists two hundred institutions which were involved in at least one of EEBO-TCP Phase I, EEBO-TCP Phase II, ECCO-TCP, Evans-TCP, many of which were involved in multiple of these projects. “This list does not include higher-education institutions based in the UK, all of which are counted as EEBO Phase 2 partners thanks to consortial funding” (TCP “Our scholarly partners”). The “FAQ” page still shows traces of the enormity of this undertaking. One question reveals that each partner library committed $60,000 to the venture, an amount which funds the keying and conversion of only around 250-300 books — a large number, but a drop in the bucket compared to the approximately 73,000 books which the TCP as a whole has encoded.
A ten-person working group developed an encoding standard. The University of Michigan Library staff developed instructions to use this encoding standard. And then the text creation began. “Texts were selected each month at Michigan, page-images were supplied by ProQuest, marked-up transcriptions were submitted by the vendors, and quality control and editing undertaken at U-M Library and soon also at Bodleian Libraries in Oxford and subsidiary sites at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, and at the University of Toronto.” (TCP “About”)

            <Text>Finally, chapter 5 of this dissertation examines the works of Hannah More across several digital corpora. Hannah More is selected as a particularly difficult writer to grapple with, both bibliographically and in terms of critical reception. 
Hannah More’s first book published was the pastoral drama A Search after Happiness, published in 1773. Her early writing is focused on the theatre. In 1774 she published her play The Inflexible Captive, which was produced in 1775 at the Theatre Royal in Bath. In 1776, she published Sir Eldred of the Bower and the Bleeding Rock. In 1777, she published her first conduct-book, Essays on Various Subjects, dedicated to the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu. Her play Percy, A Tragedy was also produced at Covent Garden in 1777, running through 1778. In 1779, her third play, The Fatal Falsehood, was performed but was considered a failure, after which More stopped writing for the stage. From this point, she primarily wrote various forms of didactic and religious prose, with the occasional didactic and religious poem. In 1782, she published Sacred Dramas and Sensibility: A Poem, her first foray into poetry. In 1783, she wrote The Bas Bleu, which circulated in manuscript but did not see print until 1786. In 1786 she published Florio, a poem in praise of rural life, and The Bas Bleu. In 1788 she published Thoughts on the Importance of the Manners of the Great to General Society, as well as Slavery: A Poem. More’s first publication in this dissertation’s decade of interest is her 1789 poem, Bishop Bonner’s Ghost. In 1790, she published An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable Works. In 1793, she published “Village Politics,” a counter-revolutionary tract for the poor which came to embody the reaction against Thomas Paine. In 1793, she published Remarks on the Speech of M. Dupont in aid of French emigrant clergy. In 1795 she began the massive undertaking of editing, and largely writing, The Cheap Repository Tracts, the writing for which she is now most known. These tracts were distributed as inexpensive chapbooks from 1795 to 1797. In 1798, she reprinted many of these tracts in volume form. In 1799 she published, under her own name, Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education, and another volume of Cheap Repository tracts. Unlike Charlotte Smith and Mary Robinson, More had a long career after this dissertation’s decade of interest, nearly all in the form of didactic prose. A third volume of Cheap Repository tracts was published in 1800. In 1803, she published some patriotic ballads. 1804 saw “The White Slave Trade,” “an attack on the frivolity of the fashionable world” (Stott). In 1805, she published, anonymously, Hints toward forming the Character of a Young Princess. 1806 saw another edition of tracts in volume form. In 1808 she published her only novel, Coelebs in Search of a Wife. In 1811 she published Practical Piety. In 1812 she published Christian Morals. In 1815 she published Essay on the Character and Writings of St. Paul. In 1817, in response to civil unrest, she began republishing the Cheap Repository Tracts as Cheap Repository Tracts Suited to the Present Times. She reprinted and distributed these from 1817 to 1819, and wrote some new ones. In 1819, she published Moral Sketches and an abolitionist poem. In 1821, she published Bible Rhymes. In 1825, she published The Spirit of Prayer, her last new publication, written at age 80 after more than 50 years of writing. A fifth volume of Cheap Repository tracts appeared in 1827. More died in 1833, age 88.</Text>

            <Text>“Chapter 6, “‘Man people woman life’ / ‘Creek sheep cattle horses’: Influence, Distinction, and Literary Traditions,” turns from the source and reception of fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers to its content, and to the question of whether colonial writing demonstrated any distinct features. Given the transnational market in which colonial literature developed, it has been argued that a distinctive AustralianPage 12 → literary tradition was impossible. I show, to the contrary, thematic tendencies in colonial fiction that are clearly different from those in American and British writing. Focusing on rural colonial spaces, characters, and activities, such writing resonates in certain ways, including in its masculine orientation, with the primary framework through which nineteenth-century Australian fiction was perceived prior to the transnational turn: the bush tradition.” (11-12)

“it is entirely possible that Australian fiction largely resembled—that is, imitated—popular genres imported from elsewhere. Of course, given the scale of fiction involved, this relationship is not one that can be ascertained simply by reading. Working at the rate of a story a day, reading all of the extended fiction harvested in this project would take more than sixteen years; in this light, selecting a sample and systematizing analysis of the contents without computational assistance would present an insurmountable challenge.” (158)
Actually, this is a scale at which I suspect reading could be applied: two people at two stories a day could do it in four years. Especially if you’re still going to select a sample!
Looked at “text files representing 75 percent of the extended fiction in the curated dataset and 81 percent of unique titles” (161) — so, 12 years of one person/story/day. 3 years of 2 people/2 stories/day. It would, obviously, be a massive and expensive undertaking, but by no means beyond the scope of what scholar have done. The better argument is that ‘just reading’ could not produce the information that the computational methods do.

“Topic modeling has been used extensively in digital literary studies, albeit often Page 159 →in the gray literature attached to the field: in blogs, conference presentations, and shared code.” (158-9)
“But the focus on corpus-wide “topics,” largely separate from the literary works these patterns arise from, undermines the method’s usefulness for literary history. Decision trees provide a means of tying the results of topic modeling to literary works and, more particularly, of associating word patterns with historical categories of documents.” (159)

“We might expect gendered tendencies in fiction to be more apparent than national (or protonational) ones. But word patterns emerge as more strongly indicative of whether an author is American, Australian, or British than male or female. ” (159)

“Topic modeling—especially latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) using Mallet software (McCallum)—has attained a similar degree of prominence in digital literary studies that network analysis has for book and periodical historians. As multiple articles and blogs elaborate, topic modeling is an unsupervised statistical classification method for identifying patterns in the use of words within documents and across a corpus.4 The researcher allocates the number of topics that the program will create, and a machine-learning algorithm sorts all words in a corpus (barring the excluded or “stop words” specified by the researcher) into that number of groups based on the probability of their co-occurrence. Words that occur in the same document more often than would be expected based on their presence across the corpus are designated as “topics.”” iBooks. ” (160)

She uses topic modelling for ill-defined “conceptual” reasons, as well as practical ones, that it works on unstructured text and is resilient to OCR errors.
Indeed, “topic modeling is able to produce topics comprised largely or entirely of OCR errors and to indicate the presence of such topics in each document. These topics can be excluded from analysis, as I do with the one-hundred-topic model used here” (161)

“The one-hundred-topic model investigated in this chapter is based on text files representing 75 percent of the extended fiction in the curated dataset and 81 percent of unique titles. Sampled stories have at least three text files, which was the number analyzed for each so as not to create topics dominated by lengthy works or to exceed available computing power. This subset also provides a representative sample of fiction in terms of the date of publication, authors’ gender and Page 162 →nationality, and newspapers’ locations. Digital appendix 7 describes the parameters by which this one-hundred-topic model was created, including a summary of the sample’s relationship to the curated dataset; digital appendix 8 presents the topic model’s results and inputs, including my stop-words list. In addition to Mallet’s standard inclusions, my stop words incorporate those created by Jockers for Macroanalysis (“Expanded”) as well as an extensive list of people and place names produced by analyzing the text files using Stanford’s Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel, Grenager, and Manning).5 Although this chapter seeks to explore the relationship between the contents of stories and their national or protonational associations, I did not want the extensive references to particular places (or character names) in this fiction to overdetermine the composition of topics.” (161-2)

“Despite its considerable strengths, topic modeling’s uncertain epistemological standing presents a challenge for employing the method in literary studies (Liu, “Meaning” 414). Various proposals have been made as to how a topic should be conceived, including as a “fiction” that alludes to works that might have been created but were not (Buurma); as a lens for viewing a corpus where there is no correct magnification, just more “appropriate” lenses “depending on the analyst’s substantive focus” (DiMaggio, Nag, and Blei 582); or as a “discourse or a kind of poetic rhetoric” rather than words linked by a single referent or concept (Underwood, “Topic” np). Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood describe topics as “interestingly slippery objects that require interpretation” (“Quiet” 363). Emphasizing their varied potential meanings—topics might “reflect rhetoric frames, cognitive schemata, or specialized idioms . . . [or] even indicate a discourse in Foucault’s sense” (361)—they also note the capacity of topics to exceed interpretive boundaries. “Goldstone and Underwood’s articles and associated datasets and visualizations also exemplify many of the strategies digital literary scholars employ to create a robust foundation for interpreting topics beyond the allusions of the prominent keywords, which in no way exhaust a topic’s meaning (Schmidt). These include analyzing all words in a topic, tracing the occurrence of words in different topics, examining the documents where a topic is most prominent, graphing a topic’s presence in the corpus generally or over time, and considering relationships between topics based on those most likely to occur Page 163 →prominently in the same documents (Goldstone and Underwood, “Quiet”; Goldstone and Underwood, “What”).
While these approaches are useful for exploring word associations across a corpus, they are not appropriate to the historical question I want to ask: were certain word patterns more likely to occur in or to characterize writing by men or women, or by American, Australian, or British authors? Existing approaches view the corpus in terms of topics and largely remain within the heuristic parameters of those (ambiguously defined) entities. A topic is selected for analysis because of some feature it demonstrates: for instance, its keywords are interesting to the researcher, or the topic is statistically prevalent. Typically, documents are considered only when they contain the highest proportions of words in a selected topic. My question, in contrast, begins with literary works and their historical features and seeks to explore word patterns that are most likely to characterize certain categories of documents. While the existing approach uses documents to exemplify topics that are intuitively or statistically interesting, I want to see if certain topics exemplify fiction by particular (gendered or national) categories of author.” (Bode 162-3)

“This chapter reconnects topics—conceived simply as patterns of Page 164 →words—to the historical documents from which they arise by interpreting this documentary metadata using another unsupervised statistical classification approach: decision trees.7 The goal of this analytical tool—to identify the most “important” variables in complex datasets—has been applied to questions in fields ranging from ecology to economics and sociology. “Importance” is defined by explanatory power: the capacity of a variable, based on where it is split along a spectrum, to explain a feature of a dataset. I used this method to identify the proportions of particular topics (the variables) that align most strongly with (explain or predict) whether a story is by a man or woman, or an American, Australian, or British author (the features of the dataset I am interested in understanding).” (Bode 163-4)

#

“this chapter focuses on the initial two layers of nodes. These indicate the topics and thresholds that successfully categorize the largest number of titles by authorial gender or nationality. In this respect it is significant that, after the first two splits, accuracy increased only gradually in the decision tree trials I conducted … This trend shows that the gender and nationality of most authors is predictable by a small number of topics and, hence, a limited range of word associations” (Bode 166)

“In indicating tendencies or inclinations in the type of literary language used by groups of authors, this integrated method employs quantitative measures without reducing literary meaning to them. It also offers an intelligible foundation for moving between the literary system and the individual literary work.” (166)

“All of these stories are characterized by women writing about women and girls and thus reinforce the notion that nineteenth-century popular fiction was highly gendered. But the contrasting effects of that focus—to reinforce traditional gender roles or to imagine alternative ones—warn against simplistically interpreting the meanings of word patterns. It foregrounds the necessity of reading the stories—not just the topics—highlighted by this integrated method.” (169)

“In fact, this integrated method is better at predicting whether an author is American, Australian, or British than a man or a woman. Challenging the idea that Australian fiction failed to develop original characteristics, it emerges as the most distinctive category due to representations of nonmetropolitan colonial life.” (169)

“Decision trees can predict author nationality for this corpus with 59 percent success with two and four splits, increasing only marginally to 61 and 62 percent with six and eight splits, respectively. While the overall percentages are lower than for gender, the improvement on expected accuracy is almost double. Because three categories (American,Page 170 → Australian, and British) are involved rather than two (male and female) the expected accuracy for predicting nationality is approximately 33 percent, versus 50 percent for gender. With two splits, the capacity of decision trees to predict nationality with 59 percent success is an improvement on expected accuracy of 79 percent, compared with 44 percent for gender.” (169-70)

“Topic 80 (“creek sheep cattle horses men verandah hut country man horse track township blacks tree river squatter tea gum night”) is consistently situated as the root node in all trees, regardless of the number of splits allowed. A title is predicted to be Australian based on the presence, above a very low threshold (here, 0.61 percent), of the words associated with topic 80, and to be either American or British based on the relative absence of these words.” (170)
“the important point here is that the hierarchy of topics remains the same, even as training and testing produces varied outcomes with respect to topic thresholds and rates of prediction of the different categories.” (171)

“The substantial presence of unknown authors might also suggest the low quality of this fiction. In the stories I have read this is sometimes the case. But for the most part the quality of these works does not seem worse than writing by well-known nineteenth-century Australian (or other) authors. What is true is that most of this fiction was never published in book form and consequently has received little attention from literary or cultural historians.” (173)
Suddenly and boldly makes quality assessments!

Conventional wisdom is that Australian bush fiction erases Aboriginal presence in favour of an uncanny lurking absence, but Bode finds that the bush fiction depicts a lot of Aboriginal characters. These are still racist depictions for the most part, but they do not match the narrative.
“More particularly, the omission of these stories [featuring Aboriginal characters] from Australian literary history implies the role of literary criticism, rather than colonial ideology, in the exclusion of Aboriginal characters from the Australian literary canon. Rather than a racist conspiracy by literary critics, I think the representational framework in identity politics produces and sustains this belief in Aboriginal invisibility in literature.” (180)
“Reading this fiction, it is immediately obvious that Aboriginal characters must have featured in colonial bush fiction. Stations and other rural industries in Australia in this period could not have functioned without the slave labor that Aboriginal people provided, so stories that depicted the bush without Aboriginal characters would have seemed false. In identity politics in literary criticism, however, oppression and emancipation are equated with nonrepresentation and representation, respectively; the claim that Aboriginal characters were excluded from colonial fiction expresses this political framework to the occlusion of the fiction published. As analysis of mass-digitized collections enables scholars to identify and challenge previous curations of the literary-historical record, I expect similar disjunctions between the contemporary canon and the fiction of past periods will come to light.” (180)

“So much remains to be learned about the fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers, perhaps especially the local writing. In this respect, themes such as the representation of Aboriginal people, gender distinctions in juvenile fiction, and the depiction of miners and mining cry out for further investigation. Certainly, it cannot be said of colonial fiction, as Dolin proposes, that it lacked original or distinctive features. I have argued that it differentiated itself in ways that resemble the bush tradition described by mid-twentieth-century Australian literary scholars. But these stories were more communal and domestic than such accounts allow, even if they were just as male oriented—in authorship and in the activities they describe—as feminist literary critics argued in the 1970s and 1980s. The bush was also prominent in local fiction throughout the nineteenth century, instead of emerging as a theme in the 1890s, and far from excluding Aboriginal characters, these narratives asserted colonial ownership by prominently and consistently depicting them, sometimes in highly unsettling ways.”
“Perhaps because their national cultures were at a stage where local surroundings were taken more for granted, American and British writers, at least as they were published in Australian newspapers, do not appear to have shown the same interest in describing characteristically American or British settings. Instead, these literary traditions were characterized by divergent attitudes toward history and time. The propensity for American fiction to focus on the narrative present, and on individual specificity and agency, suggests an optimistic view of the future and of the capacity for present actions to shape it. British fiction tends, instead, to emphasize the interconnectedness of past, present, Page 197 →and future and the difficulty for individuals to intervene in and alter this relationship. That Australian fiction demonstrates both attitudes toward history and time, while diverging from American and British literature in other ways, speaks to the complexity of cultural distinction in a transnational fiction market and points to a world of future research opportunities.” (Bode 196-7)</Text>

Conclusion last 2 paras:
“Translation, then, could be used to build a literary reputation, but it is also implicated in literary failure and stereotypical images of eighteenth-century translators include both cultural icons like Pope and Dryden and the starving Grub Street hack. By examining the many ways in which both men and women used translation, and especially by expanding the focus of our studies from authors who wrote both translation and original work to include authors who never wrote original material, such as Charles Jervas, we will discover more about how translation worked in the literary marketplace and why someone like Jervas, whose friendship with Pope would have familiarized him with the pitfalls of literary production, would have viewed translation as both desirable and within his reach, or at least, worth trying for after his death, when the publication was unlikely to harm him. Translation was not an easy route to fame. Translators had to fight the tendency to identify the translator with the original author, and they / had to establish their literary focus, showing that they cared about their production and were not churning out substandard material in an attempt to win fame and money. Yet many writers, particularly women, still used translation in order to create and establish a reputation, creating new discourses around translation as a hobby, a profession, and a genre.
Reputation consists of many factors, and no one strategy serves all writers. Some writers fail to achieve literary fame because they do not have the literary ability to command recognition. Others fail due to lack of funds, or lack or cultural capital, or public scandals that destroy their reputation, and Adam Rounce, who argues that “literary failure is a necessary concomitant to our understanding of artistic success,” demonstrates the provocative possibilities opened by the study various styles and “types” of failure.583 The vast majority of writers never have a chance to reach the status which these four authors attained. But for those authors with the talent, the drive, and the connections to succeed in the eighteenth-century literary marketplace, translation was an important strategy for building a reputation, a source of creative energy, and a method of forging connections, implying relationships, and demanding equality with other literary figures.” (Fleming 285-286)</Text>

            <Text>A collocation formula like “ix,[3],68[i.e. 60]p. ; 4⁰” (the physical description of Smith’s The Emigrants provided in the ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP) is no more transparent and obvious in meaning than the following markup:
&lt;listPrefixDef&gt;
            &lt;prefixDef ident="tcp"
                       matchPattern="([0-9\-]+):([0-9IVX]+)"
                       replacementPattern="https://data.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/view?pubId=ecco-$1&amp;index=ecco&amp;pageId=ecco-$1-$20"/&gt;

                       matchPattern="(.+)"
                       replacementPattern="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/textcreationpartnership/Texts/master/tcpchars.xml#$1"/&gt;
         &lt;/ListPrefixDef&gt;
Indeed, the collocation formula is less transparent than simple markup like the following:
&lt;titleStmt&gt;
                  &lt;title&gt;The emigrants, a poem, in two books. By Charlotte Smith&lt;/title&gt;
                  &lt;author&gt;Smith, Charlotte Turner, 1749-1806.&lt;/author&gt;
               &lt;/titleStmt&gt;
It may even compare unfavorably to relatively well-commented code, like the following:
# iterate through the directory

for filename in listdir_nohidden("./" + directory):



	# define the path to this file

	path = "./" + directory + "/" + filename



	# strip the file's namespace

	try:

		xmlstring = stripNamespace(path)

	except:

		print "error stripping namespace of file %s" % (filename)

What these comparisons intend to illuminate is not that collocation formulae ought to be simpler or more accessible. Rather, my point is that specialized encoding serves a practical purpose, and that it is a matter of training which determines what encodings will seem natural and useful.</Text>

            <Text>According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny. In fact, by the metric of ‘unique entries in the ESTC database,’ the most popular author of the decade is by far Great Britain, followed by Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain, and King George III. Paine, More, Wesley and Shakespeare are only able to rise to our notice if we intervene in the dataset to filter out all authors whose names contain the phrase “Great Britain”; otherwise, Shakespeare is outnumbered by the House of Lords and by the Church of England. And a single paragraph cannot contain all of the reasons that the quantity of unique entries in a database would not correlate with any useful definition of popularity -- although later parts of this dissertation will undertake to enumerate them at greater length. These claims demonstrate that a poorly formed question will produce a useless and stupid answer even (or perhaps especially) if computation is used to answer it. This dissertation is dedicated to the formulation of better questions. I am interested in the limits of the generalizations that we make, both in “distant reading” research and in non-digital scholarship. I take as my starting point the contention that, in order to identify what is “popular” or “important,” we must also understand what is normal. At its core, my question is: given that it is not possible to read everything (or even most things), how do we, and how should we, determine what to read, preserve, study, and teach? This “question” is, of course, many questions: what we do is by no means what we should do; what we read is not necessarily what we study or teach. It is also an old, nearly an old-fashioned question. The current moment of self-reflection in the field of Digital Humanities, however, provides a timely reason to revisit it. Even literary scholars who do not carry out “Digital Humanities” research are impacted by the corpus-building choices of major digital resources, since all literary research is now mediated at some level by search algorithms and databases, even if this mediation is as small as looking up the holding libraries for physical copies of texts. It is therefore relevant to the field as a whole if, as I contend, corpus-building has become the new canon-building: an invisible and naturalized process of selecting texts for idiosyncratic and historically-specific reasons, and then treating those individual texts as ideal representatives of an imagined “whole” of literature. </Text>

, which still frequently relies on claims that a given work was “popular” because it went through a certain number of editions, or the author was paid a certain amount, and so on. These generalizations break down in part because “popular,” as a concept, is overdetermined: does it mean financially successful, or widely beloved, or important? Examinations of “popularity” also break down, at close scrutiny, because of the contentious relationship between concepts of “popular” and “literary”: important literature should have some claim to cultural relevance, but it shouldn’t be too popular or it becomes suspect.

            <Title>1790s</Title>
            <Text>All of the computational work in this dissertation aims to identify, in as minute detail as possible, all works printed in England between January 1 1789 and December 31 1799. This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799. In England, these events caused strong and variously nationalist reactions in a country which had so recently lost its colonies in America and feared that a French invasion could come at any moment. This is the decade of Rights of Man, it is the decade of Lyrical Ballads; it is the decade of Hannah More, it is the decade of Ann Radcliffe; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. Charles Dickens’ now famous superlatives capture the tension often seen by scholars between ‘Enlightenment’ modes of writing and ‘Romantic’ or ‘Gothic’ modes, which are no longer neatly periodized as mutually exclusive.
Scholarship on 18thC works often takes the form of evaluating or assigning the cultural capital of individual works, or, perhaps, analyzing the strategies by which they accrue or fail to accrue that capital. The winners of the cultural capital game are the Romantics in poetry and Walter Scott in prose. For example, Simon Bainbridge examines the decade and its poetry through the lens of war to identify “the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott” (3). Both poetry and the poet, in his conception, are pursuing a particular kind of cultural capital that allows them to rise above their own popularity. Richard Cronin’s The Politics of Romantic Poetry and Robert Miles’ [WHICHEVER ONE IT IS], too, seem to treat Scott’s [intensely serious popular romances] as the teleological end of the late eighteenth century birth development within the novel. These works follow a pattern established from the beginning with [Kiely and Tompkins], of treating the novel as synonymous with the realist novel, and treating Romantic and especially Gothic novels as aberrations in the history of the novel, a problem which needs to be explained away. E.J. Clery’s The Rise of Supernatural Fiction has examined at length the historical conditions by which supernatural plot elements began to make limited claims to literary seriousness throughout the eighteenth century. The “rise” she describes is not an increase in volume and prominence of supernatural stories, since her starting point in 1762 (the Cock Lane ghost) is a major national phenomenon with many imitators. Rather, supernatural fiction ‘rises’ when it acquires cultural legitimacy. Michael Gamer has more recently expanded on how this ‘rise’ fuelled Romanticism’s own rise. Gamer, like Bainbridge and Cronin, primarily examines Wordsworth and the ‘winners’ of the struggle for cultural capital: I, like Clery, am more interested in the ‘losers.’ Accordingly, I attend to much that is not literature, in order to better understand why it is not.</Text>
            <Comments>Although these events, of course, did not occur on January 1 or December 31, respectively, the entirety of 1789 and 1799 are both included in my study, out of sheer technological necessity.</Comments>

            <Text>The recent quantitative turn in literary studies has reminded us of the breadth and variety of the literary field of the past. In so doing, however, it has necessarily levelled out the felt distinctions between various texts, and so risks working against the very sort of literary history that its new vistas promise: one which does justice to the workings of form across time and space. In particular, the presumptive interchangeability of texts that is required to put them into a series susceptible to quantitative analysis ignores the massively different footprint left by commercially successful (and socially canonical) texts as we move beyond their moment of initial publication. Evelina, for example, may have been just another novel of 1778 when it first appeared, but it loomed far above all other productions of that year a decade later (or anywhere beyond the metropole). Such footprints, I argue, changed the significance of their texts’ form, making it seem richer, thicker, more resonant or definitive—perhaps, for some, more stifling or oppressive—than that of their apparently similar but less successful counterparts.</Text>

            <Text>As Chun’s punning title, “Queerying Homophily” suggests, she, like many scholars, turns to queer theory as a way to address the structural failings of algorithms. “Queer DH” is a vibrant field in its own right, with many distinct but interwoven threads. Some work, like Chun’s, take the theoretical underpinnings of contemporary computational practices as their primary object of study, and conceptualize queerer theoretical approaches. Others similarly undertake non-computational research to examine computational subjects queerly, as in Bonnie Ruberg’s Video Games Have Always Been Queer. Many projects apply existing computational methods to queer literatures and histories. Often, these approaches coincide, as queer subjects demand queerer methods, as in T.L. Cowan’s Cabaret Commons. I draw inspiration from work from across this spectrum of queer DH in my pursuit of less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies.</Text>

            <Text>“e approach to literary history I have outlined above is con-troversial, to say the least. Literary arguments don’t ordinarily use numbers, and many scholars doubt that numbers can ever play an important role in the humanities. e fth chapter of this book responds to those concerns in depth.I delay this controversy to the end of the book because I don’t see it as a struggle between competing philosophies that could be decided in advance by invoking rst principles. Doubts about the value of large- scale quantitative research are doubts about the inherent interest of a new perspective on the past, and there is simply no way to know whether a new perspective will be in-teresting until you have explored it. At the end of this book, after exploring a new scale of description, I will weigh its inherent interest against the price humanists might have to pay for this expansion of their horizons. ere is, to be sure, a price to be paid for all knowledge. But in this case, the price is institutional rather than philosophical. ” (xvii)

“Objections to new methods of analysis run deeper than I have so far acknowledged. Critics claim not that it is impossible to learn anything about literature with numbers but that knowledge of this kind could only be gained by displacing a more appropriately literary mode of insight. e risk is often repre-sented as an ethical temptation or even a slippery slope toward the “death of a discipline.” (143)
“I don’t imagine that these objections can be brushed aside. ose of us who hold advanced degrees in literary study have in-vested decades of our lives in a scholarly craft that is also a com-munity. Wariness about an alternative approach to the subject is rarely just a misunderstanding that could be cleared up with a few explanations. Rather, it expresses a set of commitments to existing institutions and social ties. ose commitments change slowly, and an honest discussion of them will need to acknowl-edge enduring dierences of opinion. Discussion of that kind makes more sense in a conclusion than a preface, which is why I have deferred it to the end of this book.” (143)

“Flat- screen monitors are introduced; in a decade or two everyone is using them. This is possible because technology encapsulates change, literally containing it inside a box. e users of at- screen monitors can simply switch out their tools, without any need to change their own behavior. Change of this kind is so eortless that it can happen with unreflective speed. In the rst decade of this century, many people hoped that quantitative methods could be introduced to the humanities in an equally painless way. Digital humanists would build tools; everyone else would use them. Scholars might not need to under-stand all the details inside the box, any more than we have tradi-tionally worried about the innards of a search engine when sh-ing for sources. Foundations invested millions of dollars trying to support this quick, painless kind of change. But for the most / part, it didn’t happen. Instead, change has taken place slowly, and mostly through laborious retraining. e reason, I think, is that new methods have turned out to be more consequential than was widely believed a decade ago. Search engines can be encapsulated and treated as tools. But statistical models are not well envisioned as tools: they offer new methods of representing and interpreting the world. Scholars cannot adopt a new mode of interpretation without fully understanding the reasoning it implies.” (144-5)

“Other aspects of digital humanities may take the discipline by storm. You can learn to build a website in a week, so many scholars are already building their own websites. But quantitative analysis of large digital libraries requires a massive commitment of time and labor; I would be surprised if even 2% of literary scholars under-took that commitment over the next decade.” (145)

Once we distinguish distant reading from the broader topic of digital technology and review the truly marginal position num-bers now occupy in the humanities, much debate on this topic becomes laughable. For instance, conversation about distant read-ing is often shaped by the premise that quantitative methods are displacing (or could soon displace) other critical practices, such as close reading. is concern is wholly hypothetical. Distant readers are a tiny group of scholars, exploring dicult methods / that have as yet no place in the literary curriculum. e only thing they have displaced so far is a small amount of air.” (145-6)

 “One popular way to allay fears is to rearm the autonomy of literature departments by discover-ing an impenetrable inner wall that numbers could never breach. Arguments of this form often start by admitting that numbers may be useful for some peripheral functions— such as “compiling concordances” or “deciphering Mayan stelae,” to borrow two ex-amples from Timothy Brennan. But, the writer will continue, an inherent aw in numeric representation makes numbers unt for the core purposes of literary study (“the interpretive problems... that have long stumped critics.”) Often it turns out that numbers can never illuminate individual works of literature or that they are incapable of grappling with subjective and perspectival evidence.In this chapter, I am likewise trying to measure the risks of distant reading, in order to reassure a worried discipline. Num-bers can be valuable, especially for large historical questions. But I doubt they will ever exclude, or even signicantly displace, other approaches to literature. However, I can hardly express this reas-surance by arming the solidity of a wall that separates quantita-tive reasoning from interpretation or from the study of individual texts. I have already spent most of this book poking holes in that / imagined wall. While it is true that numbers are mostly useful at large scales of analysis, for instance, I have stressed that dierent scales of description are closely connected.” (146-7)
“e reason literary scholars are unlikely to use math in every article is simply that literary schol-arship already excels at its own mission. We probably could use computational analysis to assist every close reading. It wouldn’t be epistemically impossible or ethically perilous to do so. It’s just that we can usually do a better (more vivid, more concise) job on our own. Instead of inventing a stretched story about the dangers of quantification, in other words, I propose to limit the author-ity of numbers in the humanities by remembering to appreciate some things we already do well.” (147)

The Risk of Forgetting Pleasure

“But it is fairly safe to observe that people have cared about literary history because they enjoy novels, plays, and poems. A version of literary history that didn’t help readers understand the pleasure of reading would have little reason to exist. … e boundary between the humanities and social sciences is not often described this bluntly. Suggesting that literary schol-arship is distinguished from (say) linguistics by its resonance with pleasure seems rude to social scientists. At the same time it wounds the dignity of humanists, by hinting that we are at some level entertainers. (Like most intellectuals, we would prefer to imagine that we are communing with Truth and Critique.) So while literary scholars widely agree that their discipline is divided from social science by some underlying purpose of literature it-self, we rarely identify simple enjoyment as the purpose at stake. … Literary scholars do have a special form of knowledge. But the candid way to dene its distinctiveness is to say that we have the privilege of focusing on things that are interesting or enjoy-able.” (148)
“To be fair, distant reading is hardly the only branch of literary history to run a risk of dryness lately. Rita Felski suggests that the ascendance of “critique” as a goal may have led the discipline to forget enjoyment. Joseph North argues that literary historicism, as far back as the 1980s, lost touch with the cultivation of sensi-bility that gave criticism a social purpose. … A shift from aes-thetic appreciation to historicism and moralism is exactly what we might expect to see, for instance, if novel reading itself were slowly becoming less central to popular culture and more closely associated with classrooms. That sentence is phrased subjunc-tively because I don’t know that it explains recent trends.” (149)
“Unreflectively turning literary scholarship into social science would be a bad idea. Quantitative arguments can bog down in finicky details, and detailism would aggravate a recent tendency to separate literary history from pleasure. But detailism is not inevitable. At its best, distant reading pushes in the other direction, adding a new liveliness and sweep to historical inquiry. Big questions are inherently intriguing, and the best distant readers have also been thoughtful about expository form.” (150)
“In short, math can never release literary critics from their obligation to be interesting. But a careful writer can connect math to literary pleasure in interesting ways. In fact, if hubris is interesting, I suspect distant readers will more than do their part. The notion that distant reading expresses a “new modesty in literary criticism” is the most amusing thing ever written about it.” (250)

“But I am only willing to separate literary history from social science by bluntly emphasizing literary interest and enjoyment. Scholars who try to draw a more idealized boundary between methodologies often end up universalizing narrower and more tendentious claims about the purpose of literature. One such claim, popular for the last century or so, presents literature as a mode of knowledge that resists generalization in order to acknowledge the specificity of lived experience.” (150)
“is ideal has many dierent forms. Sometimes writers em-phasize personal individuality, sometimes the concreteness of sense experience, sometimes the impossibility of measurement and comparison. But in one form or another, a contrast between generalization and particularity has remained central to literary critics’ sense of their mission for a century. If it was temporarily challenged by Marxism and structuralism, the ideal of particu-larity reasserted its authority in postmodern celebration of local knowledge and— perhaps most inuentially— in the form of the New Historicist anecdote.” (151)
“A sense that critics are sworn to resist “generalizable typicality” also lies, of course, at the root of many objections to distant read-ing. I think this impulse springs from a range of motives— some quite legitimate, others dubious. One important motive has been a desire for disciplinary autonomy. As my quotations from Ran-som, Leavis, Gallagher, and Greenblatt make clear, championing incommensurable particulars has often given literary scholars a way to declare independence from other researchers, whether historians or scientists. is impulse to hold other disciplines at arm’s length has been central to recent methodological debate, and I don’t expect to persuade every reader here. But personally, I think it is a mistake to let contemporary academic boundaries confine our definition of literature. I have already admitted that literary scholars feel besieged by other forms of knowledge. But self- defense is a raison d’état that too quickly justies incuriosity and seals a discipline o from the world. Many of the writers we study refused to separate literature so crisply from other human pursuits.” (152)

“However, leaving the contested question of disciplinary autonomy to one side, I would acknowledge in any case that the pleasures of particularity are also rooted deeply and genuinely in modern literature itself— in self- consciously concrete poetry like Auden’s and in the random- seeming details of the realist novel. These pleasures are legitimately dear to critics, both in themselves and because they create openings for a characteristically modern form of critical virtuosity. … (“The taste of this cookie dipped in tea describes not just the narrator’s own past— but something about memory generally, or modernism generally, or the commodity form generally.”) That dazzling leap across scales of description, connecting an instant of personal experience to collective historical time, is one of the distinctive achievements of modern criticism. It would be tragic if distant readers were required to renounce it.” (153)
“Fortunately, we are not. I have suggested that literary historians need numbers and statistical models to correct a blind spot in their understanding of the past. But correcting a blind spot doesn’t require us to renounce other forms of knowledge. In writing this book, I have consciously sought to work with the strengths of post- Romantic literature, anchoring models of century- spanning change in tiny moments of lived experience— from the insistence on color that shapes a conversation between two lovers in The Invaders to the oddly gendered grinning and chuckling of Raymond Chandler’s brutal men. I do want to point out, however, that the brief and theatrically arbitrary moments of experience I have used to anchor this narrative are illustrations of a distinctly modern kind. Before Romanticism, poetry often aimed for the / “generalizable typicality” that Gallagher and Greenblatt disdain. Before the novel, narrative often traded in general types as well. So I don’t draw any normative lesson from this book’s scattered moments of concrete specificity. I didn’t write those passages because close and distant scales of analysis must always be mixed in a specific ratio. I wrote them merely because a history of post- Romantic writing will be more entertaining if it resonates with post- Romantic  pleasures.” (153-4)
“But that pleasurable resonance with the object of inquiry needn’t prevent us from stepping back to distant-read the pleasures themselves. In the previous paragraph, I loosely described concrete specificity as a “specifically modern” and “post-Romantic” pleasure. But a reader who has skimmed the earlier chapters of this book will be able to date the pleasures of concreteness in a richer, less binary way, because this whole book has traced the gradual emergence of concreteness as a literary ideal.” (154)
“Having measured the curve of that emergence, we don’t have to bog down in a semantic debate about the precise degree of credit that should go to a vaguely defined Romantic dividing line. We can say confidently that insistence on concrete detail is not a timeless feature of fiction and poetry (as John Crowe Ransom maintained) but a feature that rose to prominence across the past 240 years (see figure 1.2). Going a little further, we can observe that emphasis on concrete detail was not a change that affected modern writing in general. It was a shift restricted to literary genres and was one of the primary ways they diverged from nonfiction over the past three centuries. Moreover, this was not an inchoate, drifting trend— a mere line on a graph. It was also a coherent social practice. We can define it synchronically by studying the preferences of nineteenth- century reviewers, who consistently favored poems that used the first-person singular and stories that emphasized concrete description, while tending to ignore stories and poems that relied on social generalization.” (154)

“More careful critics, like Caroline Levine, say more specically that generalizing about aggregates is in tension with relatively recent literary forms— for instance, with the Victorian realist novel, which “seems to go out of its way to avoid... the use of numbers.” Precision on this his-torical point makes a dierence. Numbers are common enough in Robinson Crusoe, after all, and even in Twenty ousand Leagues Under the Sea. e panoramas opened up by large numbers can incite the speculative imagination. But nineteenth- century real-ists like Charles Dickens and George Eliot did develop a habit of suggesting social scale only indirectly, through close- up depiction of a few cases that stand in for “uncountable particulars.” A can-did distant reader needs to acknowledge the force of this critique: over the last two centuries, high literary culture has genuinely committed itself to uncountable particularity. But it follows that, by tracing the rise of this literary ideal, distant readers can help explain some of the resistance to distant reading.” (155)

“Instead of reducing resistance to a symp-tom of an underlying paradox, we can at most describe it as the result of a two- century trend. is step toward self- understanding may perhaps give us some reective distance from presentist as-sumptions. But characterizing the pleasure of literary concrete-ness as the result of a contingent historical process will not, I hope, dispel the pleasure itself. Resistance to social abstraction remains a living fact of contemporary literary culture, and literary / historians who want to generalize about the past (whether quan-titatively or qualitatively) must acknowledge that their goals are partly in tension with contemporary literary pleasures.” (155-6)

“A scholar who combines close readings with mathematical mod-els certainly does transgress contemporary academic boundaries. But I see no reason to believe that this transgression breaks any permanent law. On the contrary, we have good reason to think that the expansion of scale permitted by mathematics will help us address a presentist blind spot created by literature’s contemporary association with individuality and particularity.
Enjoyment, on the other hand, comes pretty close to a permanent law of literary culture. So the real challenge to large- scale literary analysis is not epistemic or ethical but aesthetic: it is simply hard to write with sweep and verve about thousands of books.” (156)

The Risk of Preoccupation with Technology

“A second risk of distant reading is the danger of conflating new interpretive methods with new technologies.” (156)

Rejects the easy/expected critique of technological hierarchies reinforcing other hierarchies: “This kind of fearmongering is the flip side of technophilic hype; both are wildly exaggerated. Managing a whole digital library, like Hathi-Trust, is admittedly a big task. But specic research questions usually engage a small part of the library. Most of the analysis in this book can be done on a desktop, although some of the pro-grams might take an afternoon to run. Nothing discussed here required computing power that is available only at a few institu-tions.” (157)

“Sometimes, scholars using computational methods can them-selves become too hypnotized by the physical embodiment of these methods in computers. Several digital humanists have rightly warned the eld against the fantasy that delegating ob-servation to a machine would somehow increase the objectiv-ity of results. is fantasy— which Lorraine Daston and Peter  Galison have called “mechanical objectivity”— may be evoked es-pecially by unsupervised learning algorithms (such as clustering and topic modeling) that seem to discover patterns in the archive / without human prompting. In reality, algorithms are designed by human beings and explicitly encode human assumptions.” (158)

“In the long run, this misunderstanding can be cleared up if humanists and scientists acquire a basic understanding of each other’s methods, based on contemporary realities rather than caricatures of nineteenth- century Romanticism and positivism. Mutual understanding would lead us away from the fantasy that objectivity and subjectivity represent rmly distinct alternatives and toward a more exible conversation about human attempts to understand the world by modeling it.” (158)

“If critics of distant reading would likewise acknowledge that the technologies at stake often date back to the middle of the twentieth century, conversation on this topic could move beyond technophilia and - phobia. Few of the ideas currently transform-ing literary history are really dependent on “big data,” for in-stance. But the phrase has become indispensable for critics of quantitative methods in the humanities, because it implicitly characterizes any use of numbers as a recent fashion, originat-ing in Silicon Valley, and linked in an unspecied way to mass surveillance. I don’t think that rhetoric does much to advance mutual understanding.” (159)

“The models produced by machine learning do not have to be black boxes. They can be complex but transparent moves in an interpretive argument, and they deserve to be engaged or critiqued as arguments, not hyped or smeared by association with the Bay Area.” (160)

“I have worked very hard to separate badly framed controversies about technology from the historical and interpre-tive questions posed in this book. Instead of presenting distant reading as a conversation about the word data, for instance, I have tried to foreground a trio of older words that better character-ize the ideas at issue here. First, I have emphasized the premise that historical inquiry can be structured as an experiment. … We can minimize misleading con-rmations, for instance, by testing a hypothesis against a sample of texts, dened in advance in order to limit the researcher’s free-dom to support a predetermined thesis. Finally, I have suggested that historical experiments will often describe samples of the cul-tural past by testing models, or simplied representations of the relations between dierent concepts.” (160)
“Experiments, samples, models. These are not new technologies; they are the central concepts of twentieth-century social science. So, to frame a fair critique of distant reading, one might ask whether it simply moves further toward social science than most literary scholars are willing to go.” (161)

The Missing Curricular Foundation
Lit departments don’t actually really prepare students for distant reading, and can’t stop people from other places from reading lit since they don’t own lit

“e other shortcut I would warn against is even more tempt-ing: it involves folding distant reading into the cloudier topic of digital humanities. … e concept of digital humanities has often provided a tactful collective name for projects that were controversial if advertised separately. “New media studies” was too specically contemporary. “Distant reading” was too controversially quanti-tative. But everyone used computers in one way or another, so a wide range of students and faculty in the humanities could unite around a loosely digital common denominator.” (163)

“Finally, fram-ing every conversation as a question about technology also tends to obscure the deep roots of this project in literary study itself. Raymond Williams was already grappling with a longue durée in the 1960s; Janice Radway was already structuring literary inquiry as a quantitative experiment in the 1980s. Those writers are still good models for students to imitate— much better models, for instance, than a dizzyingly sublime network graph.” (164)

“So, to sum up the last of the three risks this chapter has ex-plored, distant reading confronts an interesting set of institutional challenges. It has deep roots in literary history that it can-not aord to forget. On the other hand, many of the most fruitful paths for future exploration require methods not yet taught in lit-erature departments. e usual solution to this dilemma is a ex-ible, multidisciplinary rubric called digital humanities. But the concept of digital humanities can be too diuse, or too focused on technology, to foster the kind of preparation distant readers / need. Dierent institutions will probably address this challenge in dierent ways; I don’t have a perfect solution to oer. In fact, I have been acknowledging throughout this chapter that distant reading is a dicult project.” (164-5)
“So I suspect distant reading will follow the trajectory of the sociology of literature— a eld that has attracted senior scholars from several disciplines and produced a series of inuential books across sixty- odd years without ever acquiring a secure home in the undergraduate literature major. I hope it will be possible for graduate students to get training in distant reading, but at many institutions, they may have to cobble together courses from sev-eral departments.” (165)

A Final Risk: Addiction to Distant Reading
“In a conversation shaped by that assumption, arguments that adjust our interpretation of local his-torical details tend to be brushed aside with impatience. “Didn’t we already know that?” skeptics often respond. “Or couldn’t we have learned it in some other way, without numbers?” e answer may be debatable, but it is hard to persuade skeptics by debating hypotheticals. So I have chosen to begin with the biggest trends, where it is fairly clear that someone would already have described the pattern if it had been a pattern the unaided eye could dis-cern. To convince humanists, I also felt that my evidence had to greatly exceed ordinary social- scientic thresholds. It was neces-sary, but never sucient, for results to be statistically signicant. Eects had to be obvious to the eye once graphed— things like a shift from a one- to- one gender ratio among novelists in the mid- nineteenth century to a three- to- one ratio in the mid- twentieth.If literary historians are capable of missing a change of that / magnitude, then we have undoubtedly also missed a host of less obvious but equally important stories. It is easy to see where some of those stories lie. In the course of writing this book, I have deliberately trimmed many threads of inquiry that would have led toward more complicated methods or sparser sources of evidence. I have tended to neglect the period before 1800, for instance, because data are harder to gather there.” (167)

“To return to the metaphor in my title: we may have acquired enough altitude now to see that the horizon of lit-erature is curved. But that discovery should only remind us how little we understand literary history as a whole.” (169)</Text>

p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017

p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017

p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017

p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: the -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: erage date of composition of the first is 1757 and the second is 1775. These results suggest that the language of aesthetic compositionexperiences a substantive change within the eighteenth century and, moreover, give us a chronological outline through which we can begin to -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: pinpoint these transformations -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  these chronological limits coincide with the beginnings of the radical increase in -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017

p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017

p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017

p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017

p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: hmm -- I've been trying to resist my impulses toward tidy clustering; sometimes text are outliers, and a long tail is to be expected.. not everything reduces down to a few categories -- Written May 2, 2017

            <Text>Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices. Its extended discussion (and, at points, critique) of the practice of critique highlights similarities between conversations about reading in the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries. For example, when Felski hyperbolically lists the “unserious” reading practices which are presumed to be the only alternative to critique, “naive reading, sentimental effusion, impressionistic judgment, fuzzy-headed amateurism, and mere ‘chatter about Shelley’,” sentimentality is explicitly named alongside forms of ‘sloppy’ thinking that are presumed to be incompatible with rationality. The need to maintain rationality in the face of emotion takes on moral implications in Felski’s hyperbole as well: without critique, the question goes, “what will save us from perdition, what will keep us from committing all those sins we’ve been warned against,” what will keep us from being dangerously bad readers? Of course, part of Felski’s conclusion is that these forms of “bad reading” are not, despite their emotional contamination, morally wrong or intellectual vacuous — but like Sedgwick, she sketches her alternative lightly.</Text>

            <Text>me I think I've talked to you about this also? the escapist fantasy, in a novel where women are powerless to do anything but cry when kidnapped, is that the crying will work
hbbo oh, huh--I don't think we have had this conversation, but that makes a lot of sense
me I've been thinking, also, about the virtues of the Gothic as a narrative mode which doesn't truck with any bullshit about women's place in the world. Powerful men are tyrants who can destroy you! Your feelings are correct on that front! You are excruciatingly vulnerable! And now here is a story where everything turns out okay anyway.
hbbo yes. a space in which to really lug out all those repressed anxieties and blow them up as big as they're able to go can be very cathartic for sure and not only cathartic but useful
me yeah, yeah The contemporary narrative of an "empowering" story for women is about women having power, and indeed a lot of criticism looks at these works to try to find the particular womanly kinds or spheres of power that make the texts "subversive" or "progressive"... and I do see some of that, there is a compelling thread of women having access to emotional manipulation of men as an effective strategy that makes men look foolish and less powerful
hbbo /me nods
me but I think for the most part they're not trying to say, "you have the incredible power of emotional manipulation!" -- I really think they're wallowing in the abjectness of acknowledging powerlessness and, this is the part that has been firing up my soul, the thing you can do, when you have no power, is you can refuse to endorse your oppressor's actions
hbbo /me nods
me this is a bit of a fantasy too, really, but it's one that speaks to me -- the idea that as long as you make them FORCE you, as long as you don't capitulate, that's -- it's not POWER, but..... hands in the air this is where I don't know what I'm saying yet
hbbo no, yeah, it's at the very least a sort of sovereignty over the self
me ooooooh, yeah sovereignty is a good term for it
me hmm, I'm thinking now that there's also a sort of exposure of tyranny, too. If you refuse to walk with your kidnapper and force him to carry you, you deprive him of some of his illusions
hbbo right I feel like this comes up a lot in like idk, narratives of long captivity, I'm trying to think of examples
me oh, yeah, there would be a connection there
hbbo like in 1984, he talks a lot under torture but it's not until he voluntarily betrays his lover that his selfhood is really broken
me ohhhh, yeah man, I read that novel like a decade too young to get anything out of it, I should revisit it
hbbo I mean, DEBATABLE how voluntary that really is if your alternative is getting your face eaten off by rats, but still
me well, the 18thC heroine ideal is to literally die before, say, signing paperwork allowing someone to take her ancestral property
hbbo yeah I read it ages ago as well ahahahahaha yes
me but that feels like part of the fantasy, this idea that you actually will just get your face eaten off by rats before you betray your own self even if in all other interactions you are timid and delicate 1984 of course not being interested in fantasy</Text>

I'm currently fascinated / mesmerized by this 1960s song "The Masochism Tango": youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOe…
Like, it's actually a fun kinky song, right? Except for what feels like a few points that go "too far" (I think strategically) and thus safely turn the whole thing into a "joke" (and therefore something that can be said in public)
Especially the bit at 3:20 about cigarette burns; it gets a laugh, but he sings it straight, and I know folks who'd be into that.
It makes me have more sympathy for people who want to argue that some 18thC Gothics are trying to subversively smuggle in radical ideas despite not fully committing to those ideas
even if you have to pretend that you're only kidding or otherwise 'take it back', to simply say certain things outright in the first place can be powerful..
..and the self-censored versions can circulate publicly in order to get into the hands of people who know how to decode them
So now I'm thinking of how the Toronto gay scene (in the 70s?) would use newspaper articles "warning" people away from dirty sinful gay hotspots, using lots and lots of detail in order to let other gay people know where to go and what to do

            <Text>“Chapter 5, “Fictional Systems: Network Analysis and Syndication Networks,” investigates fiction reprinting to explore the ways in which colonial literary culture both intersected with and was distinct from the global circulation of fiction in the nineteenth century. … I show that Tillotson’s was only one entity among many operating in Australia, that it became systematically involved with colonial newspapers a decade earlier, and by a different motivation, than has been argued, and that the involvement of colonial newspapers in publishing local writing, and in sourcing and distributing fiction, continued despite the presence of multiple international companies in the market.
Turning to provincial newspapers, I demonstrate that fiction reprinting, as well as publishing, was more common in that context than in the metropolitan one. … While past histories of Australian publishing are primarily book-based, this investigation shows that a local newspaper syndication agency, Cameron, Laing, and Co., published the most Australian fiction for the nineteenth century and probably well into the twentieth. It also reveals that provincial syndicates provided more fiction to the colonies than any of the book publishers, local or global, or the metropolitan newspapers that have been the focus of previous literary and book histories.” (11)

“Nineteenth-century newspapers were part of a strong culture of reprinting content, including fiction.1 Reflecting this culture, 50 percent of the extended fiction titles in the curated dataset appear more than once.” (123)

“Until recently, researchers have relied on manually searching analog collections and, accordingly, on relatively small and selective samples: the fiction published in particular, typically major metropolitan, periodicals; by specific, predominantly canonical, authors; or as recorded in surviving records of syndication agencies.” (123)

“Existing studies of colonial fiction reprinting stress the market dominance of the first and most famous British syndication agency, Tillotson’s Page 124 →Fiction Bureau, and the associated ascendancy of British over local fiction. I demonstrate that Tillotson’s was only one participant among many and offer a new account of the nature, timing, and effects of its colonial operations. Previously, Tillotson’s has been associated only with major city periodicals. To the contrary, the company primarily engaged with second-tier metropolitan and provincial newspapers and did so earlier, and more systematically, than has been recognized. ” (123-4)
She has very specific, and very local, arguments about reprinting that she cares about. How can I do this for the 1790s?
“For the provincial press, my analysis reveals an entirely new set of activities and actors.” (124)

“…most fiction reprinting in provincial newspapers involved an extensive, active, and hitherto essentially unrecognized array of syndication agencies operating within and beyond the colonies. This new account of fiction reprinting and syndication in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers reveals a much more complex, varied, and populated range of processes and structures—local and global—than has been appreciated. It also highlights the extent to which past studies have approached the larger, previously largely intractable, newspaper archive through the lens of smaller, more tractable archives—of particular newspapers, authors, and syndication agencies—and how this strategy has shaped and distorted understandings of colonial literary culture and its connection to the international fiction market. Of course, such partiality is not the exclusive province of analog resources and methods; as the first half of this book emphasized, digital resources and methods institute their own partial view.” (124)

“As mass-digitized collections become core disciplinary infrastructure for literary history, network analysis is increasingly used to explore the extensive datasets derived from them in order to investigate historical connections in literary culture.” (Bode 125)
“The reason for the method’s popularity is clear: its depiction of edges (relationships) between nodes (entities) resonates with a system-based understanding of print and literary culture, common in book history and periodical studies and foregrounded by data-rich literary history. Applied to the extensive datasets harvested from mass-digitized collections, the attractive visualizations enabled by programs such as Gephi appear to bring connections and configurations within such systems literally into view” (125)
“However, at least as it is currently employed in data-rich literary history—and arguably, inevitably for research based on mass-digitized collections—network analysis inhibits effective engagement with historical evidence. In particular, a focus on visualization impedes scholars’ understanding of the evidence available to construct and interpret network models and creates perhaps insurmountable barriers to recognizing and accommodating the evidence that is absent.” (125)
“With the exception of geospatial formats, network analysis arranges nodes entirely according to the proprieties of the available dataset. In a force-directed graph, for instance, algorithms position nodes based on the number of edges they share with others and their strength. As a result, adding new data—an inescapable prospect in a field where only a very small proportion of the documentary record is digitized—will always, and often radically, change the respective positions and strengths of all nodes and edges depicted.” (126)
“For projects based on mining mass-digitized collections, the considerable gaps in what is available to be modeled mean that network visualizations invariably present fictitious systems: arrangements that are a function of what has been digitized as much as, if not vastly more so than, how a literary system actually cohered and operated.” (126)

“Although mass digitization is understood in terms of evidentiary excess, it concurrently creates a profound evidentiary imbalance for data-rich literary history, between extensive (though incomplete) information on the contents of books and periodicals and very limited availability of the documents needed to understand the actors and institutions responsible for creating and distributing those contents.” (126)

“Humanities researchers increasingly recognize data as artifacts rather than facts (Gitelman) and algorithms as arguments that should not be black-boxed (Pasquale).7 But presenting network models as visual images—without publishing the data underpinning and produced by them—precludes assessment of these underlying procedures and their effects.” (127)

“in her work on nineteenth-century genre formation, DeWitt avoids mistaking for historical phenomena the patterns arising from data mining by reading each of the “thousands” of articles resulting from searching six databases for seven theological titles (163). Although returning her to the challenge of evidentiary excess that network analysis is intended to overcome, this approach means all 355 articles in her model meet her definition of genre formation: the claim by a reviewer of likeness between two or more titles.” (128)

“Statistical approaches offer an alternative to representational forms of network analysis, one capable of identifying and accommodating incompleteness in the data available to be modeled and interpreted. The measures I am referring to are not those built into programs such as Gephi: for instance, graph density, modularity, or weighted degree. These characterize the effects of network modeling on the available dataset; they do not accommodate gaps in evidence. Scientific and social scientific applications of network analysis employ alternative statistical approaches to this end. Measures of probability, for instance, assess the likelihood that stated characteristics of a modeled network would remain true if all data were available, while “forest” networks8 address questions of causality when underlying relationships are unknown but from a finite set. … “Such approaches recognize that questions relating to system structures and their dynamics are exceptionally sensitive to data completeness. Even with a representative dataset, for the results of network modeling to serve as a justifiable foundation for argument, the likelihood that they are the products of data availability or of random chance needs to be established and shown to be low.”
(8“This method constructs millions of networks, containing all possible combinations of causes, to explore and contrast the range of possible dynamics.”)
“But even if literary historians developed the literacies needed to conduct and interpret such measures—and narrowed the form of questions asked of network models accordingly (to consider, for instance, the structural effects of interrupting certain relationships rather than how a system works)—I do not think network analysis, alone, would support an adequate encounter with historical evidence. The probability measures needed to model systems based on highly incomplete datasets are at odds with the centrality of documentary evidence to historical argument.” (130)

“ I treated the connections and patterns proposed by network analysis Page 131 →as potential indicators of reprinting practices, not evidence of them or their meaning.
To construct my arguments, I approached these results with questions that scholars have long asked in literary history and based my answers on forms of evidence the field has traditionally relied upon.” (131-2)
“The resulting perspective on fiction reprinting in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers, and as those newspapers connected to global systems, is significantly extended by mass digitization and by the exploratory capacities of network analysis. But it is not based exclusively on the contents of a mass-digitized collection and the alignments suggested by a digital method for analyzing them, nor is it a comprehensive view. Rather than delineating a historical literary system, my analysis constructs a narrative out of multiple pieces of evidence, providing important insights but also acknowledging multiple dead ends: places where gaps in the evidence relating to the fiction published and/or to the documents needed to interpret those events limit what I can know.” (132)

She makes a lot of claims about what her charts “show” but they continue to be very clumsy/ugly bar charts that try to do a bit too much at once and often don’t feel like they show what she says nearly as strongly as she says it. (c 140)

Lots of specific details of australian printing that are not relevant to me
“While mass digitization and the methods used to analyze the contents of such collections significantly extend the evidence for Page 155 →exploring fiction reprinting and syndication, such evidence is not complete, or sufficient, in and of itself. Though broadly representative, the curated dataset is a partial reflection of fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers, fiction that appeared as a consequence of institutional and social configurations and practices that are often not discernible from periodical contents.” (Bode 154-5)</Text>

            <Text>“I have here followed the authors in counting playbooks rather than plays” (34)
“In the endnote itself I used the index totals only as numbers that reflect the increasing production” (35)
“Some items can be eliminated immediately because in the actual entries (and sometimes in the index itself ) they are identified as not really belonging in STC. Others, because of multiple, false, or misprinted dates, are indexed under two or more years, only one of which can be counted as “the right one” for that book. The authors may have eliminated at least some of these duplications but decline to say so. They do, however, point out that many numbered STC entries refer only to variants or reissues rather than to distinct editions and should be excluded. By their count these exclusions lower the total for those years by about 8 percent; my figure for the whole of 1583–1640 is fractionally higher at 8.5 percent.” (35)
“What makes it necessary to set aside many official publications—together with advertisements, blank forms, privately printed petitions, and the like—is not the commonplace circumstances of their printing but the more unusual fact that they were not intended to be sold wholesale to booksellers for resale to the general public.” “The few books printed for their authors can be reinstated without delay, because they differ from other speculative books only in that the speculators were not usually free of the Stationers’ Company.” “Surreptitious books (both Catholic and Puritan) differ in that profit was rarely the sole motive of whoever financed the printing. But it is quite unhistorical to imagine that such books were primarily intended to be given away.” “Some were sold privately to co-religionists by people outside the regular book trade; others under the counter by sympathetic booksellers. But anyone who doubts that recusant books were marketed in commercial quantities should contemplate The Manual of Prayers (STC 17263–17278.1), which went through twelve known editions in twenty-five years and another seventeen before 1641.” “The Manual of Prayers was therefore far more popular than any printed play.” (36) — I think he is overly simplistic about popularity here
“Up to this point the authors’ methodology has been generally straightforward and sensible. Start with the best-available raw numbers (STC), eliminate items that ought to be disqualified, and what remains should be the best-available approximation to the whole market. Divide by the number of playbooks, and the quotient should be the best-available approximation to their market share. I cannot fault either the approach or the results (provided that they are considered in toto rather than partially).” (37)
“four distinct arguments are offered, three of them included in the blanket claim that “patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (17). Two of those three are factually wrong.” (38) — this fight mostly seems to be about details that don't impact the 1790s
“virtually all the books protected by patent were works that had already been printed.15 It is true that no new publisher could compete for those titles, but that hardly amounted to “fundamentally different economic conditions than other books.” Most unpatented books that had been legally printed belonged to somebody” ““many copies of these books were sold to captive audiences, such as students, lawyers, or parish churches” (17). What this seems to imply is that purchases made by the wrong people or institutions, or for the wrong reasons (to study, or to use during church service), can be dismissed as reflecting the Wrong Sort of Demand” (39) 
“Market share in the real world is not always greatly affected by what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell, and is not determined at all by what academics subsequently choose to study. What counts is what the customers actually buy.” (40)
“It would have remained exactly the same book and would have been printed no less often—but the authors would not have been able to exclude it. So just how much can their distinction between “monopolistic” and other books really signify?” “Nobody had to buy the book” “People chose to buy it because they wanted to read, re-read, and sing its contents, not because some monopolist coerced them. Any serious discussion of which books sold best in early modern Britain would have to recognize that several of the most outstandingly popular were patented.” “any definition of popular that failed to include the Metrical Psalms—overwhelmingly the best-selling English book in both the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries—would be so wide of the mark as to render the word meaningless.” (41) — fundamentally, Farmer &amp; Lesser don’t claim that these plays were popular. They claim only that they were sound financial investments.
“the authors ignore an elementary arithmetical truism that completely vitiates their main conclusion. Simply put, a small percentage of a large number can be much bigger than a large percentage of a small number.” “The stubby column for sermon-books in figure 4 represents more than twice as many actual printed editions as does the imposing tower for the allegedly more popular playbooks. If reprinting denotes popularity, what should we conclude from the uncontested fact that more than twice as many sermon-books as playbooks went into at least a second edition?” “During that period the printers printed, the publishers wholesaled, and the customers in bookshops freely chose to buy more than three times as many sermon-books as playbooks.” “For my part I like to ensure that the valleys are not neglected, so I shall repeat that there were five years in which no playbooks were printed at all. But only once did the number of sermon-books drop below double figures (seven, in 1601).” (43) — I’m not wholly persuaded: if you're holding a book, and you want to know, "what are the odds that this book will reach a second edition?", it seems like Tomkis is a better bet than Shakey

“the authors are perfectly well aware of the facts and acknowledge that,“judging by market share, sermons do indeed appear to have been more popular than playbooks” (21). I am at a loss to understand how they nevertheless concluded that “sermons were reprinted much less frequently than were professional plays” (21)” “Of the playbooks of Edward Sharpham and of Thomas Tomkis, 100 percent reached third editions inside twenty years, but only 35 percent of Shakespeare’s fared as well. By the authors’ logic, Sharpham and Tomkis must have been far more popular—even though each man’s 100 percent (two out of two) was greatly outsold by Shakespeare’s 35 percent (eight out of twenty-three). Comparing percentages without regard to the quantities they represent can lead to absurd conclusions.” (44)
“More pertinently for the stationers, no more than 107 (32.2 percent), and perhaps only 104 (31.3 percent), were reprinted during the lifetimes of their first publishers” (45)
“should certainly be taken into account by anyone discussing those 785 publishers and arguing that they “must have found [playbooks] attractive investments.”” (46) — it's amazing that it's SO FEW publishers
“The figures also show that those playbooks account for 2.77 percent of the best-available approximation to the total market. Whether that is as much as 2.77 percent or a mere 2.77 percent depends on one’s outlook” (46)
“The apparent share could be artificially raised by adopting the methods by which the modern book trade constructs “top ten” lists that include only recently-published books of a specified kind.”

Anyone disinclined to believe that early modern readers could really have found books of divinity more desirable than Shakespeare quartos can easily check: choose a year at random and look up all the numbers listed for it in the STC chronological index (an exercise that should be required of every student beginning graduate work on early modern literature). No calculator will be needed to determine what pre- dominates: the vast quantity of religious material is impossible to overlook. It is not just the Bibles, testaments, liturgies, and psalters; not just the sermons and cate- chism after catechism—it is that even they are outnumbered by an interminable parade of admonitions, animadversions, annotations, answers, apologies, caveats, commentaries, conclusions, confutations, defences, dialogues, discourses, exhorta- tions, explications, expositions, guides, institutions, instructions, lectures, manuals, meditations, observations, paraphrases, prayers, preparatives, propositions, ques- tions, tractates, and (especially) treatises. Anyone unconvinced that the contents of a real bookshop could possibly have resembled those of STC should then hunt play- books in the 1616 inventory of the shop of John Foster of York.29 Customers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other “literary” publications. That is a fact of life, and it is pointless to try to evade it by juggling numbers or inventing specious reasons why certain best-sellers (such as Bibles, prayerbooks, or the Metrical Psalms) should not really count as books. Unless we recognize and accept just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers, we will never fully understand the background of the dramatic literature we now value so much more than they did. (7)
In the concluding paragraph of “Publication” I said that “I have . . . done what I can to make it difficult for future theorists to evade one inescapable fact about print- ed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been.”30 It seems that I had not done quite enough. Perhaps this paper will help to block any remaining escape routes. (47)
“I also flagged and coded all items that in my judgment were not printed for sale in bookshops.” (49)
“The titles are often little help: without being told, who would recognize The White Devil (STC 131), The King’s Shoe (STC 16686), or A Royal Edict for Military Exercises (STC 6313) as sermons, or Bowels Opened (STC 22476) as a collection of twenty?” (49)
“Other than asking it to count the records for 1640, 1641, and 1642, I have not consulted ESTC for this study. Since I criticized the inadequacies of its early modern records five years ago, there have been changes.” (49) — “Peter W. M. Blayney, untitled letter, The Library: The Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, 7th ser., 1 (2000): 72–74.”
“In the table I have deliberately falsified the numbers for 1641–42.” (50) “Anyone who thinks it would have been more appropriate to treat the nine playbooks of 1641–42 as a percentage of 6,356 (0.1 percent) instead of 1,108 (0.8 percent) is probably right.” (50)

            <Title>let's check for accuracy</Title>
            <Text>The existence of a carefully hand-corrected transcription of The Emigrants in ECCO-TCP provides an opportunity to check the reliability of the OCR in both ECCO and HathiTrust. I will proceed from the assumption that the ECCO-TCP files are 100% accurate, and that any differences between the OCR and ECCO-TCP represents an OCR error. Before beginning the experiment, my hypothesis was that both ECCO and HathiTrust would differ from each other in where and how they are inaccurate, but would have similar accuracy overall. I suspected that they were likely around 50% accurate, plus or minus 10% — I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worse, but would be quite surprised if their accuracy was 80% or higher. Acquiring the plaintext files from all three sources required some hunting for some hidden options and some workarounds; rendering them suitable for comparison required some modifications of each file, described more fully in Appendix B. Although Gale Digital Scholar Labs prominently provided an “OCR Confidence” of 95%, the first glance at the document was not very promising. To my surprise, Juxa calculated a relatively low “change index” for each text compared to the TCP witness: ECCO had a .16 change from base (i.e., 84% accuracy), and my normalized HathiTrust document had only a .09 change from base (i.e., 91% accuracy). This surprised me, and suggests that skepticism of OCR in eighteenth century text mining may no longer be appropriate.</Text>
            <Comments>One exception to this assumption has to do with treatment of the character ſ, which the TCP file modernizes to an s, but which HathiTrust renders as ſ. To avoid penalizing HathiTrust for “inaccuracy” when it is actually a more accurate reproduction of the page than my reference point, I amended every instance of ſ in HathiTrust to an s.
What level of accuracy do people usually want for OCR research?
Leaving the ſ characters unchanged in the HathiTrust document resulted in a .29 change from base (71% accuracy), so my normalization of ſ to s had a major impact on the comparison. I consider the .09 result more appropriate than the .29 because the normalized copy better reflects how an OCR file would be used.</Comments>

            <Text>PRINT, PUBLICITY, AND POPULAR RADICALISM IN THE 1790S
JON MEE
Subject
Page 17
Page 17:
my approach is particularly concerned with the emergence of popular radicalism through experiment, contestation, and performance, especially in its relations to the medium of print

Page 17:
Print made it possible to think of consulting and mediating what Thelwall called ‘the whole will of the nation

Page 17:
the participants themselves shared important assumptions and ideas about print, not least the deep faith they frequently showed in its efficacy as an agent of emancipation

Page 17:
The passing of the Two Acts in 1795 severely curtailed the activities of the popular societies and provides a partial endpoint to this study.

Page 18
Page 18:
Placing this study within the series ‘Cambridge Studies in Romanticism’ implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of ‘literary’ culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies. If aspects of this approach are ‘literary’ in general terms, the book is not intended to provide a backdrop to Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights.5 In certain respects, this formation and the associated identification of the literary with what John Thelwall called ‘sallies of the imagination’ were the product of a crisis brought on by the emergence of the popular radical culture opened up in this book, but the story is not a straightforward one. Thelwall himself could identify ‘literature’ both with a domain of imagination separable from politics and with print as the principal engine of emancipatory change.
This is where Mee addresses the "But Is It Literature" question

Page 18:
My aim has been to pay attention to the everyday labours of the radical societies in creating a public sphere through print and associated practices

Page 19
Page 19:
Robert Thomson’s efforts writing and collecting for the LCS songs – discussed in Chapter 2

Page 19:
a period when radical discourse was largely concerned with a split between the represented and the unrepresented, between a narrow identification of the political nation with the elite and a broader idea of ‘the people’

Page 19:
Gerrald became a flamboyant hero of the struggle in 1793; his fate – transportation to Botany Bay and an early death – made him a print celebrity to the radical societies in 1794–5 and beyond

Page 20
Page 20:
The progressive education both received from Parr seems to have taken fire at the French Revolution and driven them into contact with men from very different social backgrounds.13 Friends of Merry saw in this process – discussed in detail in Chapter 3 – a fundamental loss of social identity

Page 20:
A more precipitous descent can be traced in Charles Pigott – tracked in Chapter 4

Page 20:
respect for literary talents with the pen did not simply translate into social deference

Page 21
Page 21:
the clerk Richard ‘Citizen’ Lee, who first appeared in print as the religious poet ‘Ebenezer’, before the period of a few months transformed him into Citizen Lee, a journey traced more fully in Chapter 5

Page 21:
Literary aspirations were not necessarily the equivalent of a desire for self-expression that placed a premium on the individual over the struggle

Page 21:
Men like Reid and Thelwall may have been first drawn to a career in print on the assumption that the republic of letters in its proper form was a sphere open to talents underwritten by the freedom of the press, but they soon discovered that this was far from the case and pressed for a more genuinely accessible domain

Page 21:
In so far as they can be reconstructed from the archive, these backstories also indicate that the popular radicalism of the 1790s was the product of forces that reached back before 1789, even as they were crucially influenced by the sense of the French Revolution as an unprecedented event.

Page 21:
radicalism in the 1790s was not the expression of a coherent ideological code or language, but the product of the social practices of the surrounding culture

Page 23
Page 23:
This book understands radical culture as a complex and unstable field of forces, ‘fragmented’ as Mark Philp has it

Page 23:
Most historians of print identify a takeoff in the number of imprints from as early as the 1760s.

Page 24
Page 24:
Print was often taken to be the precondition for discussion and debate.

Page 24:
he understood the printing of the LCS’s first Address in 1792 as the moment when it became public

Page 24:
At certain points the societies seem to operate under the spell of ‘print magic’, that is, a faith that print could liberate mankind simply by bringing ideas into printed circulation.

Page 25
Page 25:
Part I of this book explores these conditions of mediation. Chapter 1 is concerned with the key concepts of print and publicity and their relation to complicating issues of space and gender.

Page 26
Page 26:
As with much of the broader associational world of clubs and societies, women seem to have played little official part in the popular radical societies

Page 26:
More generally, though, the LCS seems to have conformed to masculine definitions of citizenship and related practices, not least in the homosocial environment of singing and toasting at dinners.

Page 26:
Chapter 2 takes a chronological route through 1792–5, tracing the way in which print formats and practices were elaborated and tested across different popular radical groups

Page 26:
How were they to identify and give form to the ‘general will’ of the people?

Page 26:
The commitment to the circulation of political information in the societies accepted Rousseau’s assumption that ‘the general will is always right, but the judgment by which it is directed is not always sufficiently informed’.

Page 27
Page 27:
‘the scattered million’ and ‘the people’

Page 27:
In terms of their everyday practice, the primary focus of this book, the radical societies encouraged an ongoing process of debate indebted to Paine’s idea that ‘discussion and the general will, arbitrates the question, and to this private opinion yields with a good grace, and order is preserved uninterrupted’.36 They self-consciously tasked themselves with what Seth Cotlar calls ‘the difficult process of constructing and sustaining an incessantly deliberative, politically efficacious and professedly inclusive mechanism for forming and discerning the general will’.
i.e., they're trying to carry out consensus-based decision making

Page 27:
Gilmartin’s acknowledgement of an alternative tendency ‘to treat internal conflict as the consequence of error or government interference, something to be corrected rather than negotiated’. ‘Print magic’, understood, as it

Page 28
Page 28:
rarely was, in its purest form, often represented differences only as the ‘prelude to some final reconciliation or union, not a permanent condition to be addressed through ongoing procedures of public arbitration.’
But this just sounds like the Sharehouse principle that all problems have solutions

Page 28:
Thompson understood the LCS primarily in terms of a class coming to consciousness. Since then literary scholars and historians have offered a diversity of accounts that have moved on from the Thompsonian model in their accounts of the radical societies.

Page 28:
I examine public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS’s name.

Page 28:
This book is very much indebted to those enquiries, but is more concerned with the attempts of the societies to create a role within a broader public sphere prior to the narrowing of opportunity after the Two Acts passed into law.

Page 29
Page 29:
the role of print personality as a form of mediation, that is, both attacks on personalities by the radical press

Page 29:
but also the development of personae by writers and booksellers

Page 29:
Many radical authors and booksellers created identities that functioned as nodal points in the flow of political information and could compete for attention in a world where personality was becoming a key aspect of publicity in the theatre and the newspapers.

Page 30
Page 30:
Eaton at ‘the Cock and Swine’ and Lee at his ‘Tree of Liberty’ participated in a print marketplace where personality mattered as an interface between print and its readers.

Page 30:
Part II of this book attends to the question of personality by looking at Thelwall as one among four different radical careers. Two of my case studies, Robert Merry and Charles Pigott, were radicals from above

Page 30:
Citizen Lee and John Thelwall are more obviously representative of the LCS’s claim to represent ‘the people’

Page 30:
For many, this broader moral programme depended on a religious vision of the ‘human’, although no less invested in various forms of print mediation, whereas for others religion contradicted what they saw as an Enlightenment imperative towards rational debate.

Page 31
Page 31:
More broadly, the radical societies continued to have strong international contacts

Page 31:
Popular radical publicity aimed, in Redhead Yorke’s words, at a ‘complete revolution of sentiment’.

Page 32
Page 32:
Their faith in the power of print and publicity was bracing in this regard, but also brought with it vulnerabilities, not least a tendency to see an unfolding moral revolution as the necessary result of the story of print.</Text>

            <Text>Leavis and New Critics want literature to create a “literary sensibility” in people
	•	even though Leavis and New Critics had different ideological values, they could agree on canon reassessment because "the two movements could be seen to provide different solutions to the same social or cultural problems.” (135)
	•	"the revaluation of vernacular works in English as the equivalent of the Greek and Roman classics provided the emergent bourgeoisie with a means of emulating the cultural capital of the aristocratic and clerical estates. The project of installing a 'literary sensibility' in the largest possible constituency was on the contrary intended to have the social function of neutralizing the very political ideologies which set the classes in opposition to one another. The literary sensibility was to unify the nation culturally just as Standard English was supposed to unify it linguistically.” (136)
	•	“literature itself can be installed as a sensibility that performs the social function of doxa— producing a state of cultural homogeneity, or unquestioned belief-- without ever requiring the 'imperfect' supplement of orthodoxy, without specifying directly what these beliefs are. Precisely because sensibility is not the same thing as belief, it is never subject to decay into mere orthodoxy." (138)

Their goal is literature as the new “doxa”
	•	"all ideology aspires to the condition of doxa" but instead encounters orthodoxy and heterodoxy ... “not even feudal culture managed to establish Christianity as a doxa, else there would have been no heresy in the Middle Ages” (137)
	•	"As a historical substitute for doxa, however, literature seems to stand in a relation of orthodoxy to beliefs that / are no longer dominant, that is, literature stands as a testament to the absence of doxa.” (137-8)
	•	“doxa (what is unquestioned, impensé) and what is openly advocated, an ‘orthodoxy.’” (157)

Actually, literature became less important, relegated to schools
	•	"literary culture and its institutions... so far from establishing a cultural doxa for the social order as a whole, or even establishing a potent ‘orthodoxy' on the basis of the literary canon, remained culturally marginal to the social formation of modernity." (139)
	•	“The school becomes the site at which the practice of reading can be cultivated in such a way as to preserve the cultural capital of literature (signified in the Brooksian allegory as a kind of /sacredness/), just because its social space can be conceived as a space of deliberate and strategic withdrawal, as the withdrawal of literary culture from 'the world’” (165)
	•	literary culture as partial substitution for clergy, semi-unsuccessful, esp as “The decline of the public sphere in the nineteenth century transforms the agents of literary culture into exclusively traditional intellectuals who nevertheless continue to imagine their relation to the social order as organic on the clerical model” -- literary institutional hierarchies follow clerical model (153)
	•	“It remains to be seen whether the retreat of literary culture to the university was really strategic." (167)

Importance of difficulty
	•	the successful distribution of Standard English (via literature) at lower levels of schooling left no way to distinguish higher levels of schooling: hence the need to revalue difficulty (171)
	•	“One may... say that difficulty itself was positively valued in New Critical practice, that it was a form of cultural capital, just by virtue of imparting to cultural objects a certain kind of rarity, the very difficulty of apprehending them." (168)
	•	“In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, these new students also discovered at the same moment why it needed to be studied in the university” (172)
	•	“Literature... presents a united front, in the form of its intrinsic difficulty, against the artifacts of mass culture” (173)

Literature vs mass culture
	•	“Therein lies the peculiar power of mass culture, since the waning cultural centrality of literary works in the face of new mass cultural forms never entailed a denial of the nominally superior value of literature” -- readers of mass media “would no doubt have concede the cultural superiority of literature, whether or not [they] ever felt inclined to read any works so designated" (173)
	•	In 1976 4th ed of Understanding Poetry, Donne's "The Canonization" “is contrasted not with secular, scientific culture, its antagonist in The Well Wrought Urn” but with a popular song from the 1920s (173)
	•	“the mass culture of modernity never coveted the institutional space to which literary culture retreated" -- uni students dutifully studied &amp; accepted the value of literature but “continued to consume both kinds of artifacts in the distinct spheres of their consumption" (174)
	•	“The capacity to experience the social space of the schools and the social space of mass culture as disjunct effectively institutionalized two modes of consumption, one consequence of which was to make literary works more difficult to consume outside the school." (174)
	•	“The effect of New Critical pedagogy was rather to produce a kind of recusant literary culture, at once faithful to the quasi-sacred authority of literature but paying tribute at the same time to the secular authority of a derogated mass culture. For the recusants the artifact of mass culture might be consumed with a certain guilt, or a certain relief; but for those whose allegiance was sworn to secular authority, that culture provided everything there was to consume." (175)

————————
Eliot &gt; Cleanth Brooks as basis for Leavis &amp; New Critics
	•	"we shall have to examine first Eliot's systematic valorization of minor poetry, and then Cleanth Brooks's transformation of that evaluative principle into a technique of interpretation" (141)
	•	Eliot
	⁃	Eliot's valorization of "minor" poets has the same problem of paradox as an embrace of "noncanonical" authors (147)
	⁃	Eliot wants to establish Christianity as a doxa -- “Eliot would like to see ‘Christian faith' as enabling poetic production in general. This conviction is responsible for his tendency to backdate his own religious inclinations, and thus to dispute the reading of /The Waste Land/ in which it stands as a modernist document of ‘disillusion.’” (150)
	⁃	Eliot's fantasy is that literary figures / literary culture can produce the social order / culture at large (152)
	⁃	"Eliot's narrative of English literary history as the story of a split between an orthodox minor tradition and a heterodox major line is thus displaced into allegorical explications of the 'internal structures' of the canonical texts, which all exhibit the features of paradox, irony, or ambiguity formerly attributed specifically to the metaphysicals and the moderns.” (157)
	⁃	“Eliot's critical career, Guillory argues, began with efforts to install a doxa-like orthodoxy that then hardened into “a fantasy of power . . . acted out by Eliot himself when he dictates with unself-conscious pomposity a new (or old) order to society on the basis of his authority as a literary figure. The most profound assumption of that fantasy was always that literary culture is the site at which the most socially important beliefs and attitudes are produced, the site at which beliefs are generated which unify the culture” (152) ” (Gorak 288)
	⁃	
	•	Cleanth Brooks
	⁃	Brooks is defined against philologists. “the emergence of the ‘literary critic' within the generalist faction did not imply a simple repudiation of the disciplinary style of the philologist, but rather the development of a more or less rigorous countermethodology of 'interpretation' which could be put in service of ‘Generalist' aims, the aims of cultural criticism." (155)
	⁃	Well Wrought Urn: “If that text discovers that all canonical literature (or literature per se) speaks the 'language of paradox,’ it still reads paradox as the evidence of a 'unity of experience' no longer available to dissociated moderns, though we moderns may continue to contemplate what we have lost in the experience of the literary artifact." (157)
	⁃	poetry's form as battling science, which is to blame for the dissociativeness of modernity (159)
	⁃	interpretation as also a powerful alternative to science (159)
	⁃	Cleanth Brooks' approach was to look for similarities between "masterpieces" rather than historical differences, and esp similarity between "masterpieces" and metaphysicals and moderns (160)
	⁃	“The revaluation of difficulty on behalf of both metaphysicals and moderns is a consistent objective of /The Well Wrought Urn/" (169)
	⁃	Brooks has to make the established literary curriculum seem difficult, in order to show that all poetry is inherently difficult, in order to show that modernist poetry is justified in being difficult (170)

Compare/contrast Leavis vs New Critics
	•	Leavis's way of valuing a work relied on its heterodoxy: thus institutionalizing it in schools removed the grounds of its critique (140)
	•	New Critics were the opposite -- wanted literature to support orthodoxy that could replace the church, without uni becoming church; treated orthodoxy as something covert to be discovered (140)
	•	Leavis sees judgment as the role of the critics; New Critics see it as interpretation (which works very very hard to find exactly what it wants to find) (141)

            <Text>Citing Source Code in MLA Style
By Joseph Wallace
To cite source code—the written portion of a piece of software or a larger program—begin with the MLA format template.1 In what follows, I explain how elements on the template apply to source code and show you how to construct an entry.
Author
Source code can be written by a person, a group of persons, or an organization (e.g., Chromium Authors). Authors are usually specified in the code itself or, on a Web site like GitHub, as the owner of the repository in which the code appears. If individual contributors are not given, treat the organization named as the owner of the license or the holder of the copyright as the author. If the organization is both author and publisher, begin your entry with the title. 
In the rest of the post, I walk you through the process of creating a works-cited-list entry for a work of source code, Buffer.java, where the publisher is the author.
Title of Source
Source code is typically presented in discrete text app/uploads/sites/3, and the file name can serve as the title. When citing titles in MLA style you would normally standardize the capitalization. However, you should not do this for titles of source code. The cases of characters are meaningful in a programming context, so you should reproduce the file name exactly as you found it. Provide the file extension when you give the title. Examples of file extensions on source code app/uploads/sites/3 include .java for Java code, .cc for C++ code, and .py for Python code. To cite the source code for Buffer.java, begin your entry with the title:
Buffer.java.
Title of Container
The container will be either the name of the software or the package in which the code is found.2 A package is a container of source code app/uploads/sites/3 within a larger program. The code for a piece of software is contained in the software itself, and so the software is the container. For Buffer.java, the container is Apache Hadoop, a collection of software:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop,
Version
Since source code often exists in several versions, provide the version of the code you consulted. This could be a version of software, a particular revision in a repository, or a commit hash (a unique string of letters and numbers that identifies a version of a piece of code). This is important information because both URLs and source code tend to change, so providing as much information as possible makes it more likely that readers will be able to find what you are citing. In the example that follows, the commit hash appears after the package name and specifies the version of the code being cited:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c 658987c1dbc3e6fce133f77,
Publisher 
The publisher for the software or the package in which the code is found is usually the organization that produced the code. Here, the software that contains the source code is published by the Apache Software Foundation:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987 c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation,
Date
The date may not be specified in source code, in which case you can omit it. If you do see a date, provide it:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987 c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation, 2015.
Since there is no information relevant to the “Location” element, this is the end of container 1.
Title of Container 2
If you are consulting code on a Web site, you will need to provide information for that Web site as the second container. In what follows, the Web site GitHub is the second container. No publisher is specified for the Web site GitHub, because it is published by GitHub (MLA Handbook 42).
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987 c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation, 2015. GitHub,
Location
If you are documenting source code on a Web site, provide the URL as the location. The MLA recommends removing “http://” and “https://” protocols from URL addresses in printed works, in which the creation of hyperlinks is irrelevant, although if the protocol is anything else, such as “ftp://,” you should include it. If you are citing these sources in a format that has the ability to display hyperlinks—for instance, if they will be displayed in html—do include the protocol. If the URL does not provide the full path to the file, you should include the full path as the file name. In the example that follows, the URL comes after the container and provides the full path to the file.
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation, 2015. GitHub, github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/ release-3.1.0-RC1/hadoop-tools/hadoop-streaming/src/main/ java/org/apache/ hadoop/record/Buffer.java.
The examples of in-text citations that follow are adapted from links posted on MIT’s Web site devoted to academic integrity (“Writing Code”). For in-text citations, if you are citing a particular method, class, subroutine, or block of code, provide the line number or numbers if known.
“The method OutputTraceToStream may be found in stack_trace_win.cc, source code written for the Chromium project” (Chromium Authors, line 59).
“As the developers note, this ‘utility class’ was intended to give ‘applets the ability to detect proxy host settings’” (PluginProxyUtil.java).

Notes
I thank Ryan Williams, former senior Web developer at the MLA, for his assistance with this post.
1. A fuller definition of source code, as defined by Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, is “a computer program in its original programming language (such as FORTRAN or C) before translation into object code usually by a compiler” (“Source Code, Noun”). The Linux Information Project specifies that “source code” is “the version of the software as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in plain text (i.e., human readable alphanumeric characters)” (“Source Code Definition”).
2. Usually when citing works in MLA style, you would not consider software to be a container. For example, in the case of a work downloaded from the Internet as a PDF and opened with Adobe Reader DC, Adobe Reader DC is not the container but the tool you used to open the work. When you’re citing source code, however, the software is the work.

            <Title>PG is the new kind of game</Title>
            <Text>The founding logic of Project Gutenberg resonates strikingly with Bordieu’s call to “universalize in reality the conditions of access” (qtd in Guillory 340, emphasis original) to literature.
The first Project Gutenberg texts are almost a parody of important texts: The Declaration of Independence, The King James Bible. These are the texts assumed to be urgently desired by “99% of the general public” (Hart “History and Philosophy”). They are then followed, however, by a work which has rarely been central to the institutional hierarchies of cultural capital: Alice in Wonderland. As Hart describes his choices of what texts to transcribe next, he seems to be describing a version of what Guillory hoped for, “another kind of game” in which texts can compete for cultural capital, a game “with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game” (Guillory 340, emphasis original).

“Project Gutenberg selects etexts targeted a bit on the "bang for the buck" philosophy ... we choose etexts we hope extremely large portions of the audience will want and use frequently. We are constantly asked to prepare etext from out of print editions of esoteric materials, but this does not provide for usage by the audience we have targeted, 99% of the general public.” (Hart “History and Philosophy”)</Text>

            <Text>Although the ECCO-TCP now seems obviously built for text-mining distant reading, in fact it is largely organized around searching and consulting individual works.

“ECCO natively supports OCR-based full-text searching of this corpus. This is significant because it meant that unlike EEBO-TCP (which produced searchable text where there was previously none at all), ECCO-TCP could only hope to produce more accurate text (and more reusable text) than what was already available. The larger size of ECCO (because of the great increase in printing and greatly enhanced chances of survival of printed works in the 18th century) also made it a different proposition: nothing so ambitious as EEBO-TCP coverage was feasible for ECCO-TCP. … Because of these greater challenges facing ECCO-TCP, it is perhaps better described as a proof of concept than as a completed project. With the support of more than 35 libraries, the TCP keyed, encoded, edited, and released 2,473 ECCO-TCP texts. A further tranche of 628 texts was keyed and encoded but never fully proofed or edited. The texts in this group remain useful for many purposes, however, and bring the total of ECCO-TCP texts to over 3,000.” (TCP “ECCO”)</Text>

            <Text>This is probably my “big chapter”

“Chapter 2, “Back to the Future: A New Object for (Data-Rich) Literary History,” responds to this challenge by articulating the case for and describing a scholarly edition of a literary system.”(6)
“I argue that explicit engagement with modeling, as the method has been theorized in digital humanities, has significant potential to enhance data-rich literary history by offering a mechanism through which to interrogate and refine conceptions of literary works and systems. But modeling alone is insufficient as a basis for the field. A data-rich model of a literary system is inevitably an argument shaped by not only the scholar’s perception of cultural artifacts and phenomena but the complex history by which those artifacts and phenomena are transmitted to and by us in the present. ” (6)
“A scholarly edition of a literary work is sometimes perceived simply as a version with extra references, or with added historical context. In fact, it is an argument—a historical and critical but also a technicalPage 7 → one—that offers a foundation for other literary-critical and historical arguments to build upon. It presents that argument through a curated text, one for which the content is, by definition, contested, and a critical apparatus that demonstrates and manages those contested features by describing and justifying the editor’s engagement with the documentary record relating to a literary work, including with the inevitable gaps, remediations, and uncertainties that engagement exposes and creates.”  (6-7)

“I argue that the field’s foundational technology of the scholarly edition supplies both the supports and constraints necessary for data-rich literary history, while providing a framework capable of extending the insights gained from engagements with emerging digital infrastructure to the broader discipline.” (Bode 35)

“In making the case for and describing a new object of analysis for data-rich literary history, based on the scholarly edition, this chapter builds on McGann’s call for “philology in a new key,” most recently in A New Republic of Letters, and on Eggert’s work on the scholarly edition as a model for conservation broadly, in Securing the Past.” (Bode 37)
“Like McGann, I propose that literary scholars respond to the challenges of digitization by employing the theoretical and practical framework through which they have long negotiated the complexity of the documentary record. ” (Bode 37)

Trying to go “beyond the view of digital literary history as defined by either the multiplication of data points (in Moretti’s and Jockers’s work) or the elaboration of unique and ultimately unknowable philological objects (in McGann’s).” (Bode 38)

“Explicit engagement with modeling, as the method is theorized in digital humanities, is essential for data-rich literary history, but modeling alone is insufficient. Modeling recognizes data as constructed, but only by the individual scholar; it does not provide a mechanism to interrogate the history of transmission preceding and perpetuated by the scholar’s engagement with the documentary record, including in its mass-digitized forms. The framework of the scholarly edition meets that challenge, presenting a structure to negotiate the incomplete and transactional nature of the documentary record and to represent the outcomes of that process.” (Bode 38)

p. 38-40: Lit review of several individual modeling-of-literary-systems papers — which I could essentially use as the basis of my own.
“These projects recognize that literary works do not exist in a single time and place but accrue meaning in the multiple contexts in which they are produced and received. And they create models based on that understanding to investigate key issues in literary history relating to production, circulation, and reception, ranging from the nature and development of literary movements and genres to the formation of authorial identities and cultural value.” (Bode 40)

“One contribution this book aims to make is to expand and enrich the application of modeling for data-rich literary history by connecting it explicitly to descriptive bibliography.” (Bode 41)

“The title changes that fiction underwent when published and republished in Australian newspapers offers a relatively straightforward example of this integration of modeling and descriptive bibliography. Collecting all manifestations of a literary work under the same title, though standard in enumerative bibliography, obscures how this documentary feature was constituted by different newspaper editors and syndicators and experienced by different reading communities. Modeling fiction with respect to the various titles used and the common title uniting related manifestations of a work supports insights into publication and reception: for instance, how editors altered the works they published and what this implies about their understandings of the readerships they served.” (Bode 41)

“Authorship was one of the most complicated features of this literary system to model. Not only were many titles published anonymously but, as chapter 4 explores in depth, some were published with attribution in one instance, and without attribution in another; some anonymously published authors remain unknown today, while others have been identified; and in many cases, the paratext of stories contained information about authorship, regardless of whether the work was published anonymously or with a named author. I embedded this information in the model through such fields as “publication author” and “author,” to differentiate the form of attribution used in the newspaper from a single name uniting an oeuvre; “signature,” to identify other titles described as “by the author of” the story within the publication event; and “inscribed gender” and “inscribed nationality,” to depict information in subtitles and other aspects of the publication event designating the story as by a man or woman and from a particular place. Detailed modeling of authorship enabled a significantly more nuanced representation and investigation of this literary-historical phenomenon than would be possible with a single author name. It also supported analysis of reception. By indicating features of authorship highlighted by different newspaper editors and syndicators, for example, it suggests ideas about cultural value informing literary culture in the colonies.” (Bode 42)

“Like other forms of textual scholarship, bibliography is often perceived as precritical and procedural. But its descriptive form has always approached bibliographical data as “capta, taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it” (Drucker, “Humanities” np). Modeling is likewise based on an understanding of data as contingent and constructed. Equally important, the two practices are underpinned by the same dual imperative: to enact and to enable critical analysis.” (Bode 42)

“But however essential it is for data-rich literary history, modeling cannot be the sole foundation for the field. Models of literary systems are not simply arguments about the existence of and connections between literary works in the past; they are arguments made with reference to the disciplinary infrastructure—the bibliographies and collections, analog and digital—that transmit evidence of past works and relationships to the present. Modeling, even when integrated with descriptive bibliography as I have described, does not reflect on this transmission. Models embody a scholar’s arguments, whereas disciplinary infrastructure is an effect of multiple arguments: a sequence of assumptions, decisions, representations, and remediations. Such histories of transmission shape how the researcher can explore, and what she can know of, the historical context that disciplinary infrastructure appears to represent. To adequately perform literary history, data-rich projects must investigate these histories of transmission and how they constitute the documentary record.” (Bode 42)

““Yet even when researchers use nonproprietary mass-digitized collections and move beyond the search box to export and explore the underlying data, the scope and reliability of such holdings are not ascertained. …  While these authors note the inevitable difference between the Page 48 →newspapers published in the past and the mass-digitized collections used to investigate reprinting, they do not characterize the nature and extent of these gaps. … Even fundamental questions, such as approximately what proportion of American newspapers have been digitized by Chronicling America, are not addressed.
It may well be that the disciplinary infrastructure used by these projects adequately signifies the relationships of production and reception they seek to investigate, but this also might not be true, or it might be true to differing extents in the different cases. In not assessing whether and how well the data analyzed represents the historical context explored, these projects ultimately interpret the characteristics not of literary-historical systems but of particular components of our disciplinary infrastructure.” (Bode 47-8)

Problem with snapshots of contemporary digital objects: “no matter how detailed his information about data construction, the basis of his study cannot be reproduced: the version of Amazon that Finn explores no longer exists. Finn’s arguments refer to his own model, and with that model unpublished, no one else can engage with these arguments on the grounds on which they are made.” (Bode 49) Similarly, if data is published in ever-changing forms, “With that expression subsumed into an “evolving and experimental” database, the basis of his argument no longer exists—at least, not in published form.” (Bode 49)

“Because these datasets are so time-consuming to construct, lack of data publication is a Page 50 →significant impediment to cumulative scholarly endeavor in data-rich literary history. Without access to underlying data, visualizations and other data summaries become the only available “text” for analysis. As well as concealing the data used, this situation occludes the fact that such summaries arise from—rather than simply invite—interpretation.” (Bode 49-50)

“But there is—and there is only—the capacity to represent the effects of engagements with particular digital collections at particular times. Herein lies the fundamental importance of data publication for data-rich literary history: in expressing a materiality that no longer exists in any other form, it offers the only possible basis for conversation on shared premises. It is not enough to point to the mass-digitized collection or bibliographical database from which data were derived. The constitutive features of that entity have almost certainly altered. And even if the digital collection has not expanded (or contracted), data-rich literary history does not analyze the collection itself. It explores the effects of scholarly engagement with and interpretation of it.” (Bode 50)

“Of the data-rich literary history projects discussed in this chapter, Underwood and Sellers’s work on changing standards of literary prestigePage 51 → most consistently enacts the curatorial elements present elsewhere in digital humanities, not least in terms of data publication. As the authors explain in an online working paper on the project, its most time-consuming element was not training their supervised model but constructing their dataset: identifying the different subgenres—poetry, prose, fiction, and drama—present in HathiTrust (“How,” 6). As well as publishing the datasets and code used in their article (“Code”), in collaboration with HathiTrust Underwood takes the major, additional step of releasing the outcome of analysis of that mass-digitized collection for others to use. This takes the form of “word counts for 101,948 volumes of fiction, 58,724 volumes of poetry, and 17,709 volumes of drama” published from 1700 to 1922, as well as yearly summaries of word frequencies for each genre. Underwood refers to this dataset as a “collection” to differentiate it from a “corpus” because “I don’t necessarily recommend that you use the whole thing, as is. The whole thing may or may not represent the sample you need for your research question” (“Dataset” np).
Signifying growing recognition of the importance of data publication, the Underwood/HathiTrust collection is an important undertaking for data-rich literary history in at least two ways. In presenting a dataset designed for literary history, it offers a shared foundation for research. Working with it, researchers can ask a range of questions based on a reliable, standardized dataset and engage with each other’s arguments in terms not only of results produced but of data investigated. In characterizing that collection as the holdings of “American university and public libraries, insofar as they were digitized in the year 2012 (when the project began), Underwood also frames a major mass-digitized collection—HathiTrust—in terms of its history of transmission (“Dataset” np). However general this framing, Underwood thus explicitly associates the dataset he publishes with a sequence of production and reception that profoundly affects its capacity to support historical analysis. In their article, Underwood and Sellers acknowledge that this history of transmission shapes their findings, noting that their model “makes more accurate” predictions for American poetry collections because HathiTrust “mainly aggregates the collections of large American libraries” (“Longue” 338).” (Bode 50-51)

“The challenge facing data-rich literary history—of proposing a historically coherent whole (a literary system) from a collection or collections of parts (the disciplinary infrastructure and the digitized documents and literary data it transmits)—suggests the strategy for meeting it. The scholarly edition has long offered both a theoretical basis and a practical technology for demonstrating and managing the documentary record’s partiality. Applied to the literary system rather than the literary work, the scholarly edition provides a framework for investigating the history of transmission constitutive of the literary system modeled, justifying the selections and decisions made in that analysis, and publishing the outcomes.” (Bode 52)
“The critical apparatus describes and justifies the editor’s engagement with the documentary record constitutive of the literary work, including the inevitable gaps and uncertainties that engagement exposes and creates. The curated text represents the outcome of that extended critical encounter, offering to those who accept its tenets—or who lack the expertise to engage with the documentary record in that manner—both an argument about the nature of the literary work and a foundation for analysis of that work.” (Bode 53)
“Much more than simply describing the construction of a dataset—something already offered by many data-rich literary history projects—this critical apparatus elaborates the complex relationships between the historical context explored, the disciplinary infrastructure employed in investigating that context, the decisions and selections implicated in creating and remediating the collection or collections, and the transformations wrought by the editor’s extraction, construction, and analysis of that data.” (Bode 53)

“A curated dataset replaces the curated text for a scholarly edition of a literary system. In the form of bibliographical and textual data, it manifests—demonstrates and, specifically, publishes—the outcome of the sequence of production and reception, including the current moment of interpretation, described in the critical apparatus.” (Bode 53)
“The model it provides is stable: it is published and accessible for all to use, whether for conventional or computational literary history. But that stability does not belie or extinguish its hypothetical character. … Its suitability and reliability for literary-historical research is established by a relationship between the historical phenomena and the data model that is explicitly interpretive and contingent rather than supposedly direct or natural.” (Bode 53)

“First, and most basically, where the latter is usable only by those with programming expertise, or access to it, a scholarly edition of a literary system should be accessible to all literary scholars through an interface for searching, browsing, and exporting the curated dataset.
Second, while the Underwood/HathiTrust collection is presented as raw data from which researchers can construct a sample, a scholarly edition of a literary system explicitly embodies an argument about historical relationships between literary works in a set time and place, at the same time as it offers a sample of literary works for analysis.” (Bode 54)

She publishes in two modes — data held by her institution, long-term storage but not very usable except by those who can code. And an interactive database, more usable but perhaps of a shorter lifespan. (Bode 55)

“what could and I think should be a key contribution of data-rich literary history to the broader discipline: an expanded bibliographical record” (Bode 56)

“Grounding data-rich literary history in scholarly editions of literary systems emphasizes that constructing literary data is just as much an interpretive and critical activity as its analysis and that the nuance of such analyses foundationally depends on the historical knowledge embedded in those constructions. With a scholarly edition of a literary system already, in and of itself, an argument about a “collective system . . . as a whole” (Moretti, Graphs 4), analyses of it can attend to the multiple features and dimensions it models. Alan Liu’s notion of “contingency” encapsulates the resulting analytic mode. Describing the relationship of historicism to the database, Liu notes that in neither form does one ask what is this whole, what does it mean? Rather, the question becomes how does this complex system I am investigating appear from this perspective? Although the whole is composed of parts that are explicitly defined and constrained—“chained to context,” as Liu puts it—the mode of inquiry it supports is transactional, enabling unpredictable connections and insights (Local 262).
As with a scholarly edition of a literary work, a scholarly edition of a literary system is thus intended not to conclude but to support various forms of investigation, including those that move between the single literary work and the system in which it existed and operated” (Bode 56)

“The approach to data-rich literary history I am advocating does not take the path increasingly recommended for the field: of integrating scientific and social scientific measures of statistical uncertainty into historical analysis (Goldstone, “Distant”). Given that constructing literary data is a historical argument made in the context of a history of transmission—the effects of which are difficult to qualify, let alone to quantify—I do not see that any assessment of error is made more useful or concise by its numerical expression. Instead, in the intersection of a critical apparatus and curated dataset, the framework of the scholarly edition offers a theoretical and practical basis to model the relationships of production and reception that constitute historical literary systems, while assessing and managing the inevitable contingency of those relationships and of the documentary infrastructure through which we perceive them.” (Bode 57)

“A model of a literary system is not only an argument about the historical nature and meaning of interconnections between literary works in the past. As chapter 2 explores, inevitably, it is also the outcome of a history of transmission: the many instances of production and reception, including the scholar’s acts of interpretation, by which evidence of those historical meanings and connections is apprehended and represented. A history of transmission constitutes the object analyzed in data-rich literary history and, therefore, a project’s capacity to advance understanding. I ended chapter 2 by outlining an object capable of describing that engagement and justifying and demonstrating its outcomes. Called a scholarly edition of a literary system, it is comprised of a curated dataset, offering a stable and accessible model of the existence and interconnections of literary works in the past, and a critical apparatus that reveals the hypothetical nature of that modeled literary system and establishes it as a reliable basis for analysis. Along with designated fields in the curated dataset, detailing decisions and arguments underpinning individual data constructions, the critical apparatus for the scholarly edition underpinning this book—of extended fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers—is composed of a historical introduction, describing the Page 60 →broad features and effects of the history of transmission producing the modeled data.” (Bode 59-60)

“Chapter 2 offers an alternative framework for data-rich literary history: one that supports the modeling of literary systems while acknowledging and representing the constructed, contingent, and transactional nature of literary data and mass-digitized collections. I use the scholarly edition as a theoretical and technical framework for meeting this challenge. The scholarly edition has for centuries been used to model literary works: its curated text proposes an argument about the imagined whole (the ideal), while its critical apparatus explains and justifies that argument with reference to the available parts (the documentary manifestations that can be accessed). It performs this latter task by presenting the history through which those parts have been transmitted to and understood in the present and, hence, by which the whole can be known. The argument about the whole is thereby presented as an effect of inquiry at the same time as it stands as a scholarly object for analysis.” (203)</Text>

            <Title>overview</Title>
            <Text>My work takes a critical algorithm studies approach to digital databases of eighteenth-century literature, examining the structural assumptions of the most-used resources (including some that scholars don’t like to admit to using). I close read the database structures, file formats, and historical documentation for the English Short Title Catalogue, Eighteenth Century Collections Online, the Text Creation Partnership, HathiTrust, Project Gutenberg, and Google Books, to examine how each resource’s algorithmic definition of a “book” (and the information that might matter about a book) is shaped by the material, historical conditions of each organization’s development. My initial research question was, by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s definition, a classically paranoid approach: I sought to expose the under-representation of women’s writing underlying apparently “neutral” digital infrastructures. This question carried the combined urgency and futility of paranoid critique: urgent, because an unfair database would expose an unfair society; and futile, since the research could only be motivated by the conviction that its answer was already known. My paper will touch briefly on some specifics of this research and my findings, as the basis for a broader discussion of critical algorithm studies, and the project of imagining reparative algorithm studies.
One of the current problems of critical algorithm studies is how difficult it is to move from critique to action: it seems that no matter how carefully we dissect the flaws of oppressive computational systems, we cannot opt out of them. Excellent work by scholars like Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Safiya Noble, for example, meticulously historicizes computational systems, and there is real value to the denaturalization of the systems they thus reveal. But this work relies on the paranoid logic of exposure, and I am interested in other attitudes. In my examination of digital infrastructures for eighteenth-century studies, I take a brief detour through Marxist thinking (via Bourdieu and John Guillory) to diagnose a deep tension between capitalist and anticapitalist value systems as the likely cause of the flaws in these systems today. I then aim to move beyond the obvious paranoid critiques prompted by this observation. I confess that, at this stage, this is the point at which my thinking remains speculative— but I feel certain that the right direction lies in queer strategies of creative reappropriation, subversion, and resistance.</Text>

            <Title>Hannah More - scholarship</Title>
            <Text>As with Robinson and Smith, More has presented scholars a challenge in the quantity and range of writing produced during her lifetime. “With a lifetime that spanned the Augustan age to the Victorian age, and a writing career nearly as long, Hannah More can be considered at once both the intellectual child of the Age of Johnson and, in spirit if not quite in chronology, the ‘first Victorian’.” (Prior) More’s “pre-Victorian” evangelical leanings, and especially the Cheap Repository Tracts, have typically attracted the most attention. The Cheap Repository Tracts are a bibliographic challenge: it can be difficult to confirm the author, publication date, or circulation of any given tract, and there are at least a hundred tracts. Additionally, since the twentieth century More has presented an additional challenge in her subject matter: as Scheuermann observes, “[t]he problem with More is that while she is a most interesting figure, her ideas are largely repugnant to modern sensibilities. Critics often deal with this inconvenience either by apologizing for their subject or by changing what she says so that she seems closer to us in spirit” (237).
More’s literary afterlife began the year after her death, in 1834, with William Roberts’ publication of a collection of her letters. Roberts’ editorial choices set the tone for More’s biographers by emphasizing her conservatism. His omissions may have improved More’s standing in the nineteenth century, but by 1952 historian M. G. Jones already acknowledges “the unsympathetic portrait of her which has been handed down to posterity” (Jones 152) due to her approach to social reform. “Unable to refute these charges, Jones can offer only the partial excuse that More’s attitudes were typical of her time” (Nardin 268). Unlike Smith and Robinson, More’s reputation did not necessarily improve when she came to the attention of feminist scholars in the 1980s and 1990s, though work on More did increase. When Pederson writes about More in 1986, the previous scholarship that she cites is all historical: More matters to historians of 1790s politics, and to historians of the evangelical movement (Pederson 85), but Pederson sees little precedent for her own discussion of More’s writing as having literary, rather than historical, importance. Pederson argues that “only by examining the Cheap Repository within the context of popular literature can we understand the tracts for what they were: a broad evangelical assault on late eighteenth-century popular culture” (88).
Pederson’s attention to More’s literary contexts is shared by other scholars of the 1980s, though only Mitzi Meyers, who in 1986 contextualizes More’s didacticism alongside children’s literature more generally, seems to form a positive opinion of More. “Mitzi Myers, delighted to have found a female eighteenth-century writer who was clearly successful, largely rewrites More so that her ‘didactic’ works ‘scarcely stand second to the canonical novel in interest and importance’ in terms of ‘what they reveal about women’” (Scheuermann 238). Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace’s 1991 monograph, Their Fathers' Daughters: Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, and Patriarchal Complicity, better sums up the consensus on More: complicit in patriarchy. Blanch’s assessment is that “[d]espite the contemporary criticism that More was usurping roles that had traditionally been reserved for men, feminist critics such as Kowaleski-Wallace, Ellen Jordan, Mona Scheurmann, and Eleanor Ty have maligned More as antithetical to the course of social reform and have dismissed her as a passive agent of the patriarchy” (Blanch 87). More’s next biographer, Patricia Demers, continues this assessment in her 1996 biography The World of Hannah More. “Patricia Demers argues in a recent study that More’s “belief in a natural hierarchical social order,” a belief which Demers finds “angering in its condescension and immobility,” prevented More from doing anything significant to improve conditions among the poor (Demers, 2)” (Nardin 268). The emphasis on More’s politics also begins to shift attention away from literary interpretation. “Writing for More is primarily a mode of instruction, whether in poetry, drama, essay, or tract, conveying either a female or a male voice of authority.” (Demers 109)
In the early 2000s, scholarship emerges that is more ready to find merit or sympathetic politics in More. Scheuermann describes this phenomenon as critics “changing what she says so that she seems closer to us in spirit” (237); Scheuermann herself presents More as reprehensible propagandist. But it is work like Jane Nardin’s — which argues that “although More was a less enthusiastic believer in the ‘hierarchical social order’ than most scholars have argued, the evasions and compromises she engaged in as a practical reformer helped to damage her reputation with posterity” (269) — which takes the more common stance. This is the More who can be inspiring in her importance and innovation, as suggested by titles like Kevin Gilmartin’s “Hannah More and the Invention of Conservative Culture in Britain” and Anne Stott’s Hannah More: The First Victorian, both published in 2003.
Throughout this history of struggling with More’s conservatism, More has been almost synonymous with the Cheap Repository Tracts. “At the time of the Repository’s conception in 1794, More’s public profile was that of a playwright and a controversial political commentator, yet, the annals of literary history emphasize her contributions as an educator and religious writer … Indeed, the ‘sublime and immortal’ Cheap Repository is the primary reason she is considered by some to have been the most prominent woman evangelical campaigner in England between 1780 and 1810” (Blanch 1). The history of these tracts begins with G.H. Spinney’s 1939 bibliography of extant Cheap Repository tracts held by the British Library. Spinney’s work filled an important need — “Scholarly recognition of the lack of clarity regarding the Cheap Repository bibliography, including authorship, dates back to Augustus De Morgan in 1864 (241-45)” (Blanch 11) — and has remained, eighty years after its publication, an invaluable source. It is perhaps only surpassed by Anna Maree Blanch’s 2009 thesis, A Reassessment of the Authorship of the Cheap Repository Tracts. Blanch makes the case that “[s]tatements describing Hannah More’s contributions have been repeated by generation after generation of scholars uncontested” (12), and describes with evident frustration several works which appear at first not to have based their claims on Spinney, but which, when traced, have their origin in the same single paragraph. Blanch herself has carried out new original research. Blanch identifies 127 tracts in the original run of the Cheap Repository Tracts, of which “58 tracts are either conclusively or tentatively attributed to More and 17 to others, while 52 tracts are described as being yet unattributable to any particular author” (Blanch 85).</Text>
            <Comments>“For example, Roberts removed criticism of the State and the Church arguably softening the ground for portrayals of More by feminist critics as complicit with the patriarchy” (Blanch 7)</Comments>

            <Text>Methodology: ctrl-F “popular”, copy full sentence within which it appears

Ch 1:
So popular did. The Lady of the Lake become with ‘the rough sons of the fighting Third Division’, Ferguson told Scott in a letter from Lisbon of 31 August 1811, that he had ‘nightly invitations’ to read and illustrate passages of it, and on behalf of his ‘messmates of the Black-cuffs’ he had written to London for a copy of the music used, in a stage adaptation of the poem (the song, ‘Hail to the Chief’, would become the Presidential anthem for the United States of America). (P 1)

Waller Scott, the best-selling and most, popular poet of the war years, had a crucial part in this process; his metrical romances, with their spectacular pageants of assembling armies and single combats of knights in. armour, transformed the imagining of war, presenting it as heroic, picturesque, and shaped by the conventions of romance at a time when war was seen to have taken on a new form, to have become modern. (P 2)

Similarly, some brief examples of the popularity of particular writers or forms of writing will help give a sense of the position of war in the poetry of the period. (P. 4)

Scott’s reign as ‘the Monarch of Parnassus’, as Byron called him (BLJ III, 219), ran for much of the rest of the war, and the martial and anti-Gallic nature of his metrical romances was matched, in shorter pieces by other writers which proved almost as popular. (P. 4)

The dominance of war as a poetic subject, and its popularity with both writers and readers, should come as no surprise given the extent to which the war defined Britain during the romantic period. (P. 5)

Indeed, in debates over the use of broadsides for ideological purposes in the 1790s, poetry was often seen as a more powerful, medium than prose because its metre, rhyme, and frequent association with popular and traditional tunes were seen to make it especially memorable for the ‘lower class of people’,.27 (p. 9)

Set to the tune of the well-known drinking song ‘To Anacreon in Heaven’ (now best-known as ‘The Star Spangled Banner’), the ballad’s radical politics and especially its implied invitation to the French to ‘tear off’ Britain’s ‘chains’ made it a target for songs that sought to reappropriate its popular tune and parody its sentiments. (P. 11)

As well as its links with the ballad and song tradition, poetry had strong connections to theatrical and visual culture, which also mediated the war to the British public, frequently calling upon a deep-rooted Francophobia which held a strong place in the popular imagination. (P. 12)

To construct England as warlike, Garrick also draws on the language of the songs and ballads that were becoming popular in the middle of the eighteenth century. (P. 14)

Warton’s poeticization of war proved, extremely influential, both in making conflict a fitting subject for imaginative writing and in creating a particular representational register, complete with personifications, (p.23) classical references, and poetic diction, that was frequently invoked in poetic imaginings of war half a century later (‘ensanguin’d field’ remains one of the most popular terms for the battlefield throughout the war) (p. 22-3)

If the imaginative grand tour of the sublime ode provided one means of transporting the poet and reader to the battlefield, another poetic (p.25) means of paying an imaginative visit to the scene of conflict was provided by the sub-genre of ‘The Field of Battle’ poem, a category which I have named after Thomas Penrose’s highly popular mid-eighteenth-century work of that name.74 (p. 24-5)
Penrose’s poem remained popular throughout the romantic period; it was republished in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in May 1794 and The Courier in January 1800 and included by Thomas Campbell in his Specimens of the British Poets (1819), as well as being widely adapted.75 (p. 55)

For example, it was the model for ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ by Thomas Campbell, who wrote both a number of popular patriotic poems on the war such as ‘Ye Mariners of England’ and ‘Battle of the Baltic’ and other, more sombre pieces such as ‘The Soldier’s Dream’, ‘Hohenlinden’, and ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ itself, (p.26) which while focusing on the destruction of conflict, tend to contain the violence of war within a romantic framework or displace it onto the natural surroundings. (P. 25-6)

It is this role of ‘excit[ing] to war’ that women are often called on to play in the poetry of the period, as in ‘The British Heroes’ published in the Anti-Gallican of 1804, which presents the ‘British fair’ as ‘Like Sparta’s matrons nobly great’—a popular analogy during the war years—as the (p.34) nation’s ‘Wives, mothers, daughters vie | Who most shall heroes animate | To conquer or to die’.95 (p. 33-4)

Published in November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin’s lament predates Nelson’s much celebrated triumph at the battle of the Nile of 1 August 1798, yet even before this ‘glorious victory’ there was no lack of poets keen to sing the actions of British heroes, with the naval victories of Howe over the French on the ‘Glorious First of June’ 1794 and Duncan over the Dutch at Camperdown in 1797 providing popular opportunities.  (P. 47)

Indeed, Pye ended one Ode by inserting ‘at the desire of the King’ lines from a popular bellicose song from an adaptation of Beaumont’s and Fletcher’s play Bonduca, set to music by Purcell in 1695: (p.48)

Boscawen’s figure of the prophetic, national bard opposing Caesar’s invading army was a popular one in the 1790s, partly because it facilitated an appropriation of Gray’s ‘The Bard’ that was easily applicable to the contemporary situation, making the bard a figure addressing a united Britain rather than speaking from its Celtic fringes.148 (p. 52)

Ch 2:

Charlotte Smith’s reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, two months after France’s declaration of war on Britain, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the eighteenth century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. (P. 55)

——

Ch 4

Wordsworth’s political sonnets of 1802–3,on which I will be focusing, were part of the huge outpouring of verse produced to unite, inspire, and. animate the nation during the invasion scares of 1797–8 and 1802–5, the period that has been named ‘the Great Terror’ when ‘invasion was the all absorbing and all pervading topic of correspondence and conversation’ (W &amp; B, I. p. xii.).2 This vast body of verse, some of which has been collected in the two- valuable anthologies The Warning Drum and Napoleon and the Invasion of England,played an important role in the wartime forging of the British (p.100) nation, both mediating the war to the British public and providing a means of patriotic expression, a textual equivalent to the volunteering that has been described as ‘simply the greatest popular movement of the Hanoverian age’.3

Ch 5

Walter Scott was by far the best selling and most popular poet of the Napoleonic wars and his metrical romances played a crucial role in mediating conflict to a nation at war. (120)

As Peter Murphy has argued, one of the best ways to gauge Scott’s popularity is to amalgamate the sales for the years 1809–11, when, he had four books of verse on the market, during which two-year period he sold ‘a breathtaking 50,500 copies’5 (121)

Scott’s picturesque treatment of battle was frequently remarked on, as we have already seen in the comments of the reviewers of the Annual Review on The Lay of the Last Minstrel and the British Critic on Marmion&gt;and was a key element in his popularity and critical reputation, as seen in Monthly Review’s comment on The Lord of the Isles that ‘the battle of Bannockburn will remain for ever as a monument of the fertile poetical powers of a writer, who had before so greatly excelled in this species of description.’37  (132)

In his Life of Sir Walter Scott, first published in 1833, Lockhart commented that Scott ‘must ever be considered as the “mighty minstrel” of the Antigallican war’(LWS, III, 54) yet such a claim might seem strange about a poet whose most popular poems were set in the early sixteenth century and whose subject matter—the internal tensions within Scotland and national conflicts between Scotland and England—would seem to emphasize division rather than the unity necessary at a time of crisis. (133)

Scott’s transformation of his readers into warriors was identified as the reason for his popularity in the Eclectic Review’s account of the poet of 1811 discussed in the opening chapter.  (138)

—

Ch 6

This combination of geography and genre in the imaginative shaping of the latest stage of the war was compounded by the fashion for romance produced by the popularity of Scott’s poetry. (149)

While it is obviously overstating the case to say that ‘the whole world read poetry’, the popularity and model of Scott’s romances coalesced with the sense of Spain as a land of romance to provide the major poetic framework for the British understanding of the war. (149)

Here writing half a decade after its conclusion, Hemans associates the Peninsular War with chtvalric history as celebrated by the popular ballads on Roland, who died heroically at Roncesvalles in 778 Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (the ‘Campeador’ or ‘E1 Cid’) who fought the Moors in the eleventh century, and Garcilaso de la Vega, who defeated a Moor in single combat.31 (156)

In the autumn, of 1809, John Murray published John Wilson Croker’s The Battles of Talavem, a poem on Wellington’s, victory over Marshall Jourdan of 27–8th July 1809, which proved remarkably popular, going through eight editions in its first year, a number exceeded only by Scott in the period 1809–10.38 (159)

Scott’s apostrophe, like his opening search for ‘a strain … of mountain fire | [which] May rise distinguish’d o’er the din of war’ (I.1), recalls Shakespeare’s Henry V: ‘O for a muse of fire, that would ascend | The brightest heaven of invention’ (Prologue, 1–2).52 If Scott seeks to associate his poem with a play popular at the time and seen as a patriotic celebration of English triumph over the French, he also invokes the representational problems posed by war (166)

The picturesque techniques of romance made popular by Scott (p.175) are set against the techniques of the sublime or horrific ode on war, familiar from the writings of the 1790s, seen in the personifications of ‘Red Battle’ and the ‘Giant’ War in the previous stanzas frequently compared to the sublime figures of Goya’s war paintings (I. 38–9).80 (174-5)

——

While the popularity of Scott’s metrical romances was superseded by the phenomenal sales of Byron’s poetry and his own success as a novelist in the years after the war, his reimagining of war remained tremendously influential throughout the nineteenth century, playing a major role in the chivalric revival, in the elevation of the warrior to heroic status, and in the romanticization of war that Michael Paris has seen as defining the ‘warrior nation’ from 1850 to 2000.1 (225)

            <Title>debate summary</Title>
            <Text>A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer &amp; Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.” Blayney’s “detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays” (F&amp;L 4) argues that playbooks “never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books” (B, qtd in F&amp;L 3) and that, based on their reprinting rate of “only” 48% of first editions, “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years” (B, qtd in F&amp;L 4). F&amp;L argue that “ like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books” (F&amp;L 4). In response, therefore, “Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends.” (F&amp;L 4). Total number of editions and frequency of reprinting To properly contextualize market share, they carefully compare plays only to other “speculative” non-monopoly works (L&amp;F 14). “Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest.” (F&amp;L 6). F&amp;L stress that they study playbooks, not playtexts.
The crucial intervention of F&amp;L’s first article is the comparison of playbooks to the marketplace at large, and to another genre (sermons), since “popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (F&amp;L 4). Also useful is the disentanglement of different metrics of popularity, since “Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (F&amp;L 26): “Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”? … For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (F&amp;L 27)
Blayney’s response take issue, first, with the books which Farmer &amp; Lesser choose to exclude, and, second, with their comparisons of percentages rather than counts. Many of his critiques rest on Early Modern historical details not relevant to my inquiry, such as his argument against Farmer &amp; Lesser’s claim that “patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (L&amp;F 17, qtd in B 38). His methodological critiques, however, are immediately applicable: regarding the comparison of reprinting percentages, he notes, “the authors ignore an elementary arithmetical truism that completely vitiates their main conclusion. Simply put, a small percentage of a large number can be much bigger than a large percentage of a small number” (B 43).
This is where I am inclined to be sympathetic to Farmer &amp; Lesser — Blayney seems to be ignoring the viewpoint from which the matter is being considered. Blayney seems to think that Lesser &amp; Farmer argue against the position that “early modern readers could really have found books of divinity more desirable than Shakespeare quartos,” (47) but this was not the question. If you have a playbook in one hand and a sermon-book in the other, which one is more likely to be reprinted? The answer to that question will have nothing to do with the total number of playbooks and sermon-books printed each year; since the question is predictive, rather than evaluative, it relies on percentages. Farmer &amp; Lesser ultimately want to contend that publishers would have published more plays if more plays had existed, that any given playbook had decent odds of turning a profit. [Why would you pose a question that way? It’s partly analogous to the question I posed re: Gothic gender, but also has a historical element. It bifurcates into one question about what kinds of books were really the best investments, and what kinds the publishers believed to be the best. F&amp;L are a bit guilty of conflating those. Blayney misses both questions, distracted by market share: see quote below from p 40] — Farmer &amp; Lesser explicitly express their wistful longing in the face of the reality that “we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books… if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists” (F&amp;L 16), whereas Blayney dismissively sniffs that “The apparent share could be artificially raised by adopting the methods by which the modern book trade constructs “top ten” lists that include only recently-published books of a specified kind” (B 47).
Blayney’s ultimate goal seems to be: “Unless we recognize and accept just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers, we will never fully understand the background of the dramatic literature we now value so much more than they did.” (B 47)
I do agree with Blayney’s central argument is that “Market share in the real world is not always greatly affected by what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell, and is not determined at all by what academics subsequently choose to study. What counts is what the customers actually buy.” (B 40). But this seems to miss Farmer &amp; Lesser’s core point that market share is not the only metric of popularity, and that “what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell” is its own valuable kind of popularity to examine.
Moreover, even if, as Blayney persuasively supports the numbers showing that, of the playbooks, “no more than 107 (32.2 percent), and perhaps only 104 (31.3 percent) were reprinted during the lifetimes of their first publishers” (45), he still has not addressed Farmer &amp; Lesser’s need to address the choice of the qualifier “only” (L&amp;F 3). By his own numbers, [what’s the fate of sermon-books??]</Text>

            <Title>no longer considering scales as different models</Title>
            <Text>My initial thesis proposal proposed approaching my decade of interest by examining three different “models” of different levels of detail: “One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.”
I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.</Text>

            <Title>everyone wants conspiracy theories to be true</Title>
            <Text>Conspiracy theories play such a huge role in France! The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!
Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

            <Title>Romantic misfits</Title>
            <Text>“The first [group of ‘misfits’] was excluded from literary history in order to secure the status of those writers who did ‘fit’ (the ‘Romantics’) even as the Romantics themselves based their claim to high literary status on their status as misfits-- on their success in transcending the literary marketplace to which other writers were represented as in thrall (because fitting too well).” (5)

“there are recurring themes, such as the manner in which the ‘structural transformation of the public sphere’ during the Romantic era is itself an integral aspect of the story of how ‘high’ literature was constructed at the expense of the ‘low’ (where ‘public engagement’ becomes a defining feature of the ‘low’, and self-cultivation a quality of ‘high’).” (6) — nowadays we value public engagement; at the time, politics/ethics was publicly engaged…?

	•	“As I see the literary culture of the period, there is a dialectical play between the radical Enlightenment and its counter. But instead of seeing the period Balkanized into three generations, with the first and last favoring ‘enlightenment modes’ and the middle settling into ‘reaction’ (or ‘Counter-Enlightenment’), I detect a constant dialectical play between these two poles that were subjectivities as much as they were political positions and, as a consequence, also stubbornly resistant to rational argument. This dialectical play is driven less by the French Revolution and more by the historical rupture it was seen to constitute. … The sense of crisis induced by the first intimation of ‘global synchronicity’, linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later, and they differ dialectically.” (11)

            <Title>corpora as the new canons</Title>
            <Text>Like literary canons, these corpora — especially smaller ones, like the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership — are vulnerable to a critique of their selection methods on the grounds of representation. However, unlike the various changing literary canons of the past, digital corpora tend to conceal which particular titles have been selected as representative. I argue that Charlotte Smith’s inclusion in these resources lags behind a scholarly consensus which sees her as increasingly important and canonical in the period. Her partial inclusion in ECCO-TCP seems particularly likely to lead to ill-supported conclusions by researchers who might easily assume that their text-mining research is taking her works into consideration. However, since none of her sonnets are included, nor any of the politically radical novels which made up a substantial portion of her latter career, nor any of her natural history, some of her most important contributions to the literature of the period are not able to impact studies in which they would be relevant. In particular, a study of women’s writing through the lens of the ECCO-TCP would emphasize the most conventional and expected women’s writing from Smith, with four volumes of one of her more straightforward marriage plot novels.
Exploring the technical affordances of the copies of Smith’s works available in each database also shows why the distorted impression of Smith’s works reflected in the ECCO-TCP’s corpus is likely to persist and continue to be reproduced: without the foundation of a reliable but transformable text (in the form of a human-corrected transcription, rather than a page image or machine OCR), there is a nearly insurmountable technical barrier before any individual project. Even to assess the accuracy of the OCR texts in ECCO and HathiTrust, I must rely on ECCO-TCP. Guillory has already argued persuasively that representation in literary canons is a matter of selection, not of exclusion, that the default state for a given text is not to be included. For Guillory, this serves as a proof that sexism and racism are rarely the direct cause of a particular text lacking canonical status; the role of social oppression in limiting textual representation occurs before scholars make their choices, when classes of people are systematically excluded from the means of textual production in the first place, limiting what we may select from. In the case of digital corpora, also, I see that the rhetoric of “exclusion” is not accurate, and directs attention away from the more complex systems at play. Although I critique the failure of ECCO-TCP to include important and relevant works by Charlotte Smith, it does not seem that she has been excluded out of a prejudice against women’s writing. Most likely, The Emigrants and Celestina were chosen because copies were conveniently accessible to a particular scholar involved in the creation of the ECCO-TCP, perhaps even directly related to a research question which would motivate them through the mind-numbing process of retyping long volumes of prose. Once these works had entered ECCO-TCP, they will naturally be re-used for text mining research which implicitly trusts the original selection. In this way, representation in digital corpora is a matter of infrastructure.</Text>

            <Text>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems (1986). Writing broadly in the tradition of Marxist criticism Levinson theorised interestingly about the relationship between history and literature in her Rethinking Historicism (1989), but it was her new readings of ostensibly unpolitical poems such as the ‘Intimations of Immortality’ ode and ‘Tintern Abbey’ in the earlier book which have had the most lasting effect. For her, political events were vital in shaping Wordsworth’s verse, even when they were apparently absent. His choice of images could reveal the link Levinson argued. An apparently innocuous reference to a solitary ‘tree’, for example, might allude to the French tree of liberty, or his ‘single field’ to the Champ de Mars. But it was the omissions that were more important, representing a deliberate suppression of political optimism and its replacement with a new system of belief, the ‘myth of the soul’ at the core of the Intimations ode. For the disenchanted Wordsworth, latching on to new ideals in the poem,‘there are victories’, wrote Levinson, 
far greater than those once anticipated from the French Revolution. Rather than grieve over those mundane losses, the reader is exhorted to set his sights on those other and spiritual palms . . . the ‘soothing thoughts that spring / Out of human suffering.’ (Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems 93–4, 98–9) 
Such an approach has perhaps proved so influential because it helps to explain, and perhaps even authorise, Wordsworth’s rather forlorn retreat from his youthful idealism. </Text>

            <Text>“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The ‘means’ in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)
“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)
“The literary syllabus is the institutional form by means of which this knowledge is disseminated, and it constitutes capital in two senses: First, it is linguistic capital, the means by which one attains to a socially credentialed and therefore valued speech” (ix)
“And second, it is symbolic capital, a kind of knowledge-capital whose possession can be displayed upon request and which thereby entitles its possessor to the cultural and material rewards of the well-educated person.” (Ix)
“The form we call ‘literature’ organizes the syllabus and determines criteria of selection much more directly than the particular social biases of judgment which have been invoked to explain the canonical or noncanonical status of particular authors.” (Xiii)
“The most politically strategic argument for revising the canon remains the argument that the works so revalued are important and valuable cultural works. If literary critics are not yet in a position to recognize the inevitability of the social practice of judgment, that is a measure of how far the critique of the canon still is from developing a sociology of judgment. The theory of cultural capital elaborated in this book is an attempt to construct just such a sociology.” (Xiv)</Text>

            <Text>Smith’s personal life sometimes overshadows this career. As her works often make clear to her readers, after a briefly comfortable youth as the daughter of a well-off country gentleman who lived beyond his means, she was married at age sixteen to Benjamin Smith, “son of a prosperous London merchant and owner of Barbados sugar cane plantations. The marriage was contracted hastily to remove her from her paternal home, now dominated by her new wealthy stepmother. Looking back in bitterness nearly forty years later, Charlotte Smith described the event as her father's decision to sell her like a ‘legal prostitute, in my early youth, or what the law calls infancy’ (Smith to Sarah Rose, 15 June 1804)” (Roberts). Benjamin Smith was cruel and violently abusive. He was also so financially irresponsible that his wealthy father, Richard Smith, wanted to prevent Benjamin from inheriting. Charlotte Smith assisted Richard with business correspondence and impressed him as responsible and competent. In recognition of her husband’s unreliability, “she persuaded [Richard] to relieve his son of all his ties to the business and establish him as a gentleman farmer in Hampshire” in 1774 (Zimmerman). Richard Smith died in 1776. “In an attempt to provide for his daughter-in-law, Richard bequeathed the bulk of his property to her children. But he had drawn up his will without professional advice; legal wranglings over the inheritance worth nearly £36,000 soon arose and were not settled until almost forty years later. By 1783 Benjamin had already unlawfully squandered more than a third of this trust and, as a consequence, found himself first in deep debt and then in King's Bench Prison.” (Roberts). After the success of the Elegiac Sonnets allowed Smith to pay for her husband’s release from prison, Benjamin Smith fled to France to escape further creditors. Charlotte Smith moved between England and France over the next year and a half to negotiate his debts, and in 1785, the family was able to return to England. In 1787, after 22 years of marriage, Charlotte Smith legally separated from her husband, “an unusual step for a woman of her time” (Fry 7), and moved to a town near Chichester with her nine surviving children (of the twelve she had given birth to). However, despite this separation, Benjamin Smith retained a legal right to Charlotte Smith’s profits from her writing. Smith moved frequently after her separation, due to financial instability and declining health. “On 23 February 1806 Benjamin died in a debtors' prison and some money reverted to Charlotte Smith. By then she was far too ill to execute her favourite scheme, to settle on the shores of Lake Leman. On 28 October 1806 she died, only eight months after her husband, and seven years before Richard Smith's estate was finally settled.” (Blank)</Text>

”When the library at Alexandria burned it was said to be an “international catastrophe.” When the most significant humanities project of our time was dismantled in court, the scholars, archivists, and librarians who’d had a hand in its undoing breathed a sigh of relief, for they believed, at the time, that they had narrowly averted disaster.” (Somers)

“He offered the library a deal: You let us borrow all your books, he said, and we’ll scan them for you. You’ll end up with a digital copy of every volume in your collection, and Google will end up with access to one of the great untapped troves of data left in the world. Brin put Google’s lust for library books this way: “You have thousands of years of human knowledge, and probably the highest-quality knowledge is captured in books.” What if you could feed all the knowledge that’s locked up on paper to a search engine?
By 2004, Google had started scanning. In just over a decade, after making deals with Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, the New York Public Library, and dozens of other library systems, the company, outpacing Page’s prediction, had scanned about 25 million books. It cost them an estimated $400 million. It was a feat not just of technology but of logistics.” (Somers)

“The human operator would turn pages by hand—no machine could be as quick and gentle” (Somers)

“It was the first project that Google ever called a “moonshot.” Before the self-driving car and Project Loon—their effort to deliver Internet to Africa via high-altitude balloons—it was the idea of digitizing books that struck the outside world as a wide-eyed dream. Even some Googlers themselves thought of the project as a boondoggle. “There were certainly lots of folks at Google that while we were doing Google Book Search were like, Why are we spending all this money on this project?,” Clancy said to me. “Once Google started being a little more conscious about how it was spending money, it was like, wait, you have $40 million a year, $50 million a year on the cost of scanning? It’s gonna cost us $300 to $400 million before we’re done? What are you thinking? But Larry and Sergey were big supporters.”” (Somers)

“Out-of-print books, almost by definition, were commercial dead weight. If Google, through mass digitization, could make a new market for them, that would be a real victory for authors and publishers. “We realized there was an opportunity to do something extraordinary for readers and academics in this country,” Richard Sarnoff, who was then Chairman of the American Association of Publishers, said at the time. “We realized that we could light up the out-of-print backlist of this industry for two things: discovery and consumption.” But once you had that goal in mind, the lawsuit itself—which was about whether Google could keep scanning and displaying snippets—began to seem small time. Suppose the Authors Guild won: they were unlikely to recoup anything more than the statutory minimum in damages; and what good would it do to stop Google from providing snippets of old books? If anything those snippets might drive demand. And suppose Google won: Authors and publishers would get nothing, and all readers would get for out-of-print books would be snippets—not access to full texts. The plaintiffs, in other words, had gotten themselves into a pretty unusual situation. They didn’t want to lose their own lawsuit—but they didn’t want to win it either.” (Somers)
But the ambitious class-action settlement was nixed by the Department of Justice, so Google wouldn’t have a monopoly. “No one is quite sure why the DOJ decided to take a stand instead of remaining neutral. Dan Clancy, the Google engineering lead on the project who helped design the settlement, thinks that it was a particular brand of objector—not Google’s competitors but “sympathetic entities” you’d think would be in favor of it, like library enthusiasts, academic authors, and so on—that ultimately flipped the DOJ. “I don’t know how the settlement would have transpired if those naysayers hadn’t been so vocal,” he told me. “It’s not clear to me that if the libraries and the Bob Darntons and the Pam Samuelsons of the world hadn’t been so active that the Justice Department ever would have become involved, because it just would have been Amazon and Microsoft bitching about Google. Which is like yeah, tell me something new.”” (Somers)
““This is not important enough for the Congress to somehow adjust copyright law,” Clancy said. “It’s not going to get anyone elected. It’s not going to create a whole bunch of jobs.” It’s no coincidence that a class action against Google turned out to be perhaps the only plausible venue for this kind of reform: Google was the only one with the initiative, and the money, to make it happen. “If you want to look at this in a raw way,” Allan Adler, in-house counsel for the publishers, said to me, “a deep pocketed, private corporate actor was going to foot the bill for something that everyone wanted to see.” Google poured resources into the project, not just to scan the books but to dig up and digitize old copyright records, to negotiate with authors and publishers, to foot the bill for a Books Rights Registry. Years later, the Copyright Office has gotten nowhere with a proposal that re-treads much the same ground, but whose every component would have to be funded with Congressional appropriations.”(Somers)

            <Title>Coker &amp; Ozment: corpora as canons</Title>
            <Text>Commenting on the potential impact of their enumerative bibliography of women in book history, Coker and Ozment say “bibliographic lists become the first step towards canon development, and from there to actual disciplinary creation" (6). 

“Gathering sources around an idea for which there is no critical consensus is a deeply ideological act that can influence how users will conceptualize the field moving forward. All of our subfield editorial choices are political, even more so than the explicit idea of a bibliography that is focused on women.” (Coker and Ozment 11)</Text>

            <Title>why CSmith?</Title>
            <Text>In addition to being a prolific and interesting writing who was prominent across multiple genres (of which there are many other authors), Charlotte Smith offers an interesting case study in a ‘successful’ recovery project. This allows me to ask: to what extent do research infrastructures ‘lag behind’ scholarly consensus? No eighteenth centuryist is now likely to say that Smith is irrelevant or unimportant to the period. In the infrastructure of literary canons as described by Guillory, she has certainly succeeded: she is given prominent space in all anthologies of Romantic literature; she regularly appears on introductory syllabi, including surveys of all British literature; there are scholarly editions, and seminars, and dissertations, conference panels, and every other sign that she is an important and valued writer. But what about digital infrastructures? Are they “up to date”? For many I would say, not really. The ESTC ecosystem is still strongly shaped by editorial decisions made at the time of microfilming, or at the time of indexing. On Wikipedia, Smith herself had a respectable wiki article, but none of her major works were covered until I began to create those articles myself over the course of this dissertation. [FOOTNOTE: One reason this dissertation does not engage with Wikipedia as an object of study, despite many interesting implications, is because I am too involved as a wiki editor to maintain an arms-length distance.]</Text>

            <Text>E.J. Clery’s The Rise of Supernatural Fiction, 1762-1800 provides an account of what was at stake for the representations of supernatural events in supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news. The “rise” she describes is not an increase in volume and prominence of supernatural stories, since her starting point in 1762 (the Cock Lane ghost) is a major national phenomenon with many imitators. Rather, supernatural fiction ‘rises’ when it acquires cultural legitimacy. Michael Gamer has more recently expanded on how this ‘rise’ fuelled Romanticism’s own rise. In Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation, he details  the interconnectedness of what are now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Gamer argues, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste without risking the loss of cultural capital which attended the Gothic’s “popularity”. Gamer, like Bainbridge and Cronin, primarily examines Wordsworth and the ‘winners’ of the struggle for cultural capital: I, like Clery, am more interested in the ‘losers.’ Accordingly, I attend to much that is not literature, in order to better understand why it is not.</Text>

            <Title>ch 4 - sampling</Title>
            <Text>In chapter four, having spent the previous two chapters examining my digital corpora as corpora, I finally use them to draw conclusions about the eighteenth century itself. Chapter four examines random samples from each corpus. Random sampling, which Steven Zwicker (Zwicker) and Leo Lahti, Niko Ilomäki, and Mikko Tolonen (Lahti et al.) have applied successfully to the English Short Title Catalogue’s holdings, makes it feasible to apply a greater level of human scrutiny to a large body of texts. For each corpus, I select a small enough number of titles that it is feasible to examine each title individually, and manually research its bibliographic details and contents. Comparing my manual assessments to the databases’s defaults allows me to calculate a probable error rate for each kind of information the database provides, which can then be used to correct the results of experiment run on the full database. I use this information to reflect again on the findings I calculated in chapters two and three. Working manually also allows me to supplement database entries with my own research. In particular, it will allow me to use better metrics of quantity or popularity. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity” (CITE), I will consider the popularity of the works in my random sample in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. Taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I pay particular attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. Identifying this information for the few hundred titles in my sample is not easy, but it is at least possible, unlike carrying out the same process on tens of thousands of titles. Again, I use the results of my manual investigation of my sample to calculate a guess about the corpus as a whole. At the end of the chapter, synthesizing all of my experiments across the dissertation, I postulate my own assessment of the number of titles published each year 1789-99, the relative quantity of various categories of writing, and the gender ratios of each category.</Text>

            <Title>method vs source</Title>
            <Text>Mark Merry’s Designing Databases for Historical Research as a rich entrypoint for historians to learn about database construction, in particular the chapter on “Conceptual models of database design” that contrasts “source-oriented” and “method-oriented” models:
“The Source-oriented model of database design dictates that everything about the design of the historical database is geared towards recording every last piece of information from the sources, omitting nothing, and in effect becoming a digital surrogate for the original...
[The method-oriented model] is based on what the database is intended to do, rather than the nature of the information it is intended to contain...
Method-oriented databases are quicker to design, build and enter data into, but it is very hard to deviate away from the designed function of the database, in order to (for example) pursue newly discovered lines of enquiry.
Ultimately, historians will need to steer a middle course between the two extreme models, perhaps with a slight tendency to lean towards the Source-oriented approach. When making decisions about what information you need from your sources to go into the database, it is important to take into account that your needs may change over the course of a project that might take a number of years.” (Lincoln)

            <Text>My introduction will define the terms and concepts which the rest of the dissertation will use, paying particular attention to the parallel development of similar concerns in DH and non-DH fields. I will explicitly note that my DH methods align me with scholars in queer DH, and discuss some of the underlying assumptions of queer theory which shape my thinking: my aspiration is a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. The introduction will also address why I define my window of interest as 1789-99, and who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.
Vocabulary to be discussed:
	•	“Surface” reading vs “distant” reading (and, of course, their ties to close reading)
	•	Popularity, canon, marginalization
	•	My preferred DH terminology around modelling, sensitivity, and fruitfulness
The introduction will thus allow me to to deal directly with the way that other researchers in my fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address my questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading.

            <Title>"gray papers"</Title>
            <Text>One of the slight embarrassments that attends on digital humanities research within the institution of the university, can be the extent to which truly insightful and influential related work occurs outside of that institution, and thus fails to conform to institutional expectations. This awkwardness is intensified by disciplinary differences, wherein even within the institution of the university, fields like computer science and literature value very different forms of publication. The ‘peak’ publication in literature, in its assumed rigor and importance, is the monograph, followed by the journal article, then perhaps a chapter in an edited collection. A conference presentation is hardly even a source to be cited in future work: these talks in literature are ephemeral, partly ad-hoc; one expects to cite, instead, the journal article which will follow a top-notch talk. This rough allocation of cultural capital to various forms of publication tracks with the level of peer review and the effort of composition involved with each. The more thoroughly scrutinized and edited a work is, the more potential value it is regarded as having: this is perfectly sensible.
The difference in computer science, then, is the difference in where the discipline carries out its own reviews. A conference paper in computer science will be blind peer-reviewed by external reviewers, with readers’ reports and revisions, based on a full manuscript (rather than just an abstract) before the paper is accepted to the conference. In other words, very nearly the process which occurs for a journal article in literature. Conferences in computer science have acceptance rates around 30%, though particularly prestigious conferences have acceptance rates around 15%. At the conference itself, rather than the many simultaneous panels of a literature conference, one paper is given at a time, which is assumed to the worth the attention of all attendees [DOUBLE-CHECK THIS]. When the full manuscripts of these presentations are then distributed in the conference proceedings, therefore, it is a top-tier publication. Computer science thinks of itself as a fast-moving field such that any research which went through the old-fashioned process of becoming a book is sure to be outdated by the time it’s printed: books are assumed to be textbooks for undergraduates, the sort of thing one produces as a career is winding down, to demonstrate broad expertise in well-established foundations [DOUBLE-CHECK THIS]. [ALSO EXPLAIN ARXIV.ORG]
Some digital humanities work, then, circulates in conference proceedings which can appear suspect in the literary field, and we have relatively few monographs (though that is starting to change). [Also important: blog posts.] [Bode calls it the “gray literature”]</Text>

            <Text>I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.
I’m interested in strategies of feeling as an ethical concern which lives on today with discussions of reparative reading, and I’m interested in textual timeliness as subject matter that can shed light on the individuality of text’s strategies of feelings through bibliographical and computational research.
My thinking has led me to a methodology, a subject matter, and a philosophical/emotional stance.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change.</Text>

            <Title>life</Title>
            <Text>More’s biography differs strongly from Smith’s and Robinson’s in that she never married. Instead, much of More’s personal life centred around educational ventures. In 1758, when More was thirteen, her eldest sister Mary More opened a girls’ boarding school, which Hannah More would soon assist in running. In 1762, this school moved to larger premises. In 1767, More accepted a proposal of marriage from William Turner, though this did not end in marriage: “After a rather humiliating six-year courtship (during which the pending marriage was postponed three times by the gentleman), a settlement was reached on behalf of More by her family, resulting in an annuity that granted her enough financial independence to embark on a literary career” (Prior). When the engagement was finally broken in 1773, More made her first visit to London, and her life’s focus shifted from education to literature. She moved in literary circles, joined the Bluestockings, and particularly befriended the famous actor David Garrick. However, after Garrick’s death and the failure of her third play, both in 1779, More’s focus shifted again, from London literary life to religious life. Her interest in the growing movement of Evangelicals ultimately brought her to the Clapham Sect, whose foremost cause was the abolition of the slave trade (Prior). She returned to Somerset, buying her own house, Cowslip Green, in 1785, and religion brought her back to education. She and her sister Patty More founded the first of the Mendip Schools at Cheddar, Somerset in 1789. “With the encouragement and support of the Clapham Evangelicals … More undertook opening and operating Sunday Schools … in order to teach the children of the laboring classes to read and write, to learn the catechism, and to lead moral lives informed by Christian teaching. Though the effort was clouded by political and theological controversy from various sides, More eventually opened sixteen schools that taught hundreds of students.” (Prior). In 1790, the More sisters hand over the Park Street school to Selina Mills. In 1792, she founds women’s benefit clubs at Cheddar and Shipham. 1799 marks the beginning of the “Blagdon controversy”: “one of More's teachers is accused of Methodism; the accusation widens into a series of attacks on More for alleged religious and political subversion; as a result she suffers depression and nervous collapse and for a while is unable to write,” until 1802 (Stott). In 1801, More retired— somewhat. She moved to a new home, Barley Wood, outside the village of Wrington, where she maintained a voluminous correspondence and continued to receive and advise many visitors (Prior). In 1813 she founded an auxiliary Bible Society at Wrington. “She continued to support generously efforts at poverty-relief until her death. More died September 7, 1833, having survived all of her sisters and most of the members of her London circle of friends” (Prior).</Text>

            <Title>Drucker</Title>
            <Text>It is a common critique of Digital Humanities research that computational methods, or computational evidence, go hand in hand with claims of scientific, empirical, objective truth. Johanna Drucker’s influential “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” for example, suggests that even by drawing a bar chart or line graph like those which appear in scientific journal articles, a humanities scholar goes astray. Drucker introduces a valuable contrast between “data” (an essentially imaginary phenomenon, of unmediated true information which a realist, empiricist researcher can accept as “given”) and her term “capta” (the true form of all data, partial and ambiguous information, “captured” and constructed for a particular researcher’s purpose). Drucker’s distinction between data and capta is widely cited, especially by DH researchers who then go on to refer to their capta as data throughout. Drucker’s core argument has, essentially, two parts:
...the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a “picture” of “data”. (12)
The first claim, that “data” is always already interpreted, is one that continues to animate and trouble DH scholarship. The second claim, that the primary site at which capta masquerade as data is through visualization, has received less uptake. In chapter two, as I produce visualizations of the role of women’s writing in 1790s literature, I will return to Drucker and the role of data visualization in humanist research. It is certainly possible for visualizations to disguise the constructed nature of the underlying information, but, as Katherine Bode has recently shown in detail, the illusion of unmediated truth in computational research runs deeper than visual display.</Text>

            <Text>Women made up a nearly negligible portion of the titles published in England during the 1790s. If one were to choose a title at random, it would be more likely to be written by a man named John than by a woman. But we do not choose titles at random— even in large-scale digital humanities research. We neglect the genres from which women are most strongly excluded: medical texts, legal texts, sermons, and other discourses tied to specialized (male) occupations. We prefer fiction and poetry, the forms most open to women. Even then, we overrepresent women. I want to be very explicit that the overrepresentation of women is not inappropriate: it strikes me as a very positive sign that we might have grown less sexist in the intervening two hundred years. Instead, the logic of “representation,” which underpins discussion of literary canons and syllabi, is not a good fit for understanding the infrastructural impact of contemporary digital databases. 

Discovering that women account for only 3% of attributed authors at the end of the eighteenth century 

- 3% is really small
- Scholarly work overrepresents women
- It is fine and appropriate to overrepresent women, per Guillory
— A core contention of feminist scholarship is that works by women have a heightened relevance or historic interest to us today; scholarly attention does not need to exactly replicate past attention
—— We don’t have to be recovering “popular” / “successful” literature to make it interesting/worthwhile

We have not truly grappled with the challenge that the eighteenth century poses to our idea of “the author.”</Text>

            <Title>surprise!</Title>
            <Text>Thus far, the importance of reparative work to DH is evident. But what about the other direction? Just as, I argue, both DH and bibliography have important resources to offer to each other, so to do I argue that DH has something to offer to reparative reading. Specifically, a well-formulated DH praxis can introduce a new relationship to the experience of surprise which is so challenging in paranoid reading. The most common dismissals of DH research are attempts to say, “we already knew that” — essentially, [PARANOID AVOIDANCE OF UNPLEASANT SURPRISE FROM DH COMING FOR THEIR JOBS]. This reaction invites two responses. First, [if the experiment told us that everything we knew was COMPLETELY WRONG, this would not be very good because probably at least some of what we know is right; an experiment should validate some of our existing knowledge]. [Experiments fall into two categories: those which tell us about our methods, and those which tell us about our fields of study]. Second, as scholars such as Ted Underwood have noted, it is often only retroactively that these discoveries are declared to be “obvious” results which everyone “already knew” (CITE). If we are asked to form an explicit hypothesis in advance, we might be very surprised by the exact numbers. [TRANSITION] Rather than being an awkward fit for my theoretical aims, and rather than pursuing reparative reading in spite of my computational methods, I see the laborious, intimate process of experimental computation as a directly valuable source</Text>

            <Text>Reading Wolfenbach, Emmeline, Coelebs, and now Clermont, I have been impressed again and again by the importance of, hm, women's duplicity? The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness. I want to read more about the sentimental nove;: it seems like there is a really direct line form there to Radcliffe.</Text>

            <Text>My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.
I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” </Text>

            <Text>Radcliffe is remarkably stable in her choice of publisher
When Smith begins to branch out into more political radical works, she needs to branch out into new publishers as well
Robinson: ???
More accomplishes her stunning volume of work partly by being a publisher as much as she is an author. (See: The Apprentice’s Monitor) Her shifting publisher data is mostly information on the Cheap Repository Tracts. [But I was cautioned that these dates are less reliable!

            <Comments>TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.
TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.
TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.</Comments>

            <Title>inclusion/exclusion in canons</Title>
            <Text>“Smith aspired to a place in posterity, but her contemporary success failed to secure her a place within the newly-emerging national canon. Whilst the absence of women poets from our literary histories has been a ubiquitous complaint, Smith was not entirely forgotten: her contribution was assessed in a variety of nineteenth-century anthologies, dictionaries and celebrations of ‘lost’ female talent. This essay will evaluate Charlotte Smith within these publications to reveal her colourful fate in posterity.” (Duckling 203)

“Smith was excluded from Housman’s A Collection of English Sonnets (1835) on the grounds that her sonnets were ‘mawkish effusions’.” (Duckling 205)

“Because traditional literary history has customarily privileged male writers at the expense of female ones, for much of the last century and a half Smith (like many other women) was routinely relegated to the margins when she was remembered at all. Thus William Lisle Bowles was widely credited with resurrecting the sonnet with the publication of his Fourteen Sonnets in 1789, a misperception to which Coleridge perhaps unintentionally contributed in the Biographia Literaria, where he praises those sonnets without mentioning Smith, whose own sonnets predated Bowles’s by some five years and demonstrably influenced them. At the time, thought, many writers saw matters correctly” (Behrendt 196)
“Not surprisingly, few authors of the period wrote in much detail about Smith’s direct influences upon their works, although it is clear from sonnets like Bowles’s, Coleridge’s, Wordsworth’s, Opie’s, Hanson’s, Dark’s, Keats’s, and even Anna Seward’s that her influence was wide, formative, and powerful, just as it was in prose fiction for novelists like Austen, Radcliffe, Opie, Scott and others. Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain), while there is no question that her life itself continued to hold real interest for many — and especially for many women — in the first several decades following her death.” (Behrendt 201).

“In English she returns again and again to Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Thomson, Gray, Collins, Goldsmith, Sterne, and, her favourite contemporary poet, William Cowper. Among French writers her taste is highly eclectic, though she returns often to La Rouchefoucauld, Rousseau, and, especially, Voltaire… Her Italian favourites are Petrarch’s sonnets and Mestasio’s operatic arias… She knows no German, but is keenly aware of the distinctive place occupied by Goethe’s Werther in the literature of sensibility. There is one other literature in which she is not only proficient but, for a woman author, surprisingly forthcoming: Latin. She certainly admires Cicero, Horace, and Ovid, but she reserves a special place for Virgil.” (Curran 176)
— Cf Guillory: she OUGHT to be succeeding on all the metrics for cultural capital, but gets left behind when we change those metrics..?

“In its fourteen essays, this collection illustrates Smith’s depth and versatility as an author. It offers varied and astute readings of her work as deeply informed by history, culture, and politics, and through Behrendt’s and Duckling’s essays on her posthumous reputation and her literary afterlives, it shows how Smith’s centrality transmuted into a marginality derived from cultural insistences on seeing her as a woman who wrote, rather than a writer who was female. Countering the few lingering descriptions of Smith as obscure or minor, the essays in this volume aptly demonstrate how seriously scholars need to treat her work, and how vital and central she is to our understanding of British Romanticism.” (10)

“As Mary Poovey has argued, the ultimate effect of the revolutionary decade was to set women on their journey towards the ‘Victorian pedestal’, as increasingly idealized imaged of femininity took hold: female artists were expected to embody purity and goodness in their art and in their lives. Concurrently, women writers were being marginalized by what Gary Kelly has described as a ‘remasculinization’ of literature and culture.” (Duckling 208) Smith stopped being anthologized as a poet, and entered anthologies as a poetess.
Brydges and Barbauld anthologize/praise Smith as an artist in a mixed-gender field 1808-1810 (though still in gendered terms). This shifts: Dyce (1825) and Rowton (1848) and Bethune (1848) and Adams (1857) anthologize in separate women-only collections, praising both her art and her life. Women anthologize her differently: Elwood (1843), Williams (1861), and Kavanagh (1862) see more literary importance.
“From a critical perspective, Charlotte Smith lost intellectual ground by the end of the nineteenth century, but women’s poetry was still a commercial venture and her poems frequently appeared in popular anthologies.” (Duckling 216). But Robertson’s 1883 poetesses anthology dismisses the poetry as unpleasant to read, even though Smith was admirable.
More recent critical history: “In the early twentieth century, critical accounts focused on Smith’s contributions to the novel. In 1913, Saintsbury believed Smith was ‘something of a person in herself, but less of a figure in history, because she neither innovates nor does old things consummately.’ Even the first extensive study of Smith by Florence Hilbish, whilst highlighting many areas of innovation, arrived at the conclusion that she produced ‘little strikingly original’ material … the twentieth century was not yet ready to truly appreciate Charlotte Smith. This is evident in Ernest Bernbaum’s / indifferent review of Hilbish’s work, which concluded that ‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable.’
The feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s generated a surge of interest in women’s writing, predominantly focused on the novel. Simultaneously, a revived interest in the historical context of literature enabled Bishop Hunt to demonstrate the influence of Smith on Wordsworth in 1970, although Smith remained a minor poet. By the 1980s the situation was changing rapidly. Perhaps this is because, in many respects, the critical climate began to reflect the same cultural preoccupations of Smith’s own age: a fascination with recovering the poetry of the past, a market predisposed to female anthologies and biographies, and a feminist interest in the plight of the woman in history. Smith had maintained a place in the popular female histories and collections in the nineteenth century, and had begun to be taken seriously by the academy in the twentieth century. In the 1990s, however, Smith enjoyed a popularity matched only during her own lifetime, with three separate reprints of the Elegiac Sonnets appearing during that decade. With the scholarship of Stephen Curran, and the academic anthologies of Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, and Andrew Ashfield (amongst numerous others), Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism. This is most clearly exemplified in the recent appearance of Jacqueline Labbe’s monograph on Smith, which explores Smith’s work beyond the constraints of gender and establishes her as a major influence on Wordsworth. As our definitions of Romanticism have been radically redefined, Smith may have finally achieved the winning combination of popularity and posterity.” (Duckling 216-217)</Text>

            <Title>data structure</Title>
            <Text>So, how do these ideas of the edition and the ideal copy shape the data structures employed in the building of the ESTC? Consulting an individual ESTC record in the online database, as we can see in Figure &lt;$n#fig:estc-emigrants-record&gt;, reveals a lot of information all pointing ‘outside’ of the ESTC itself. It begins with six details which will be present for every title: the “System Number” and “Citation Number” uniquely identifying the record; the author; the title; the publication information; and a physical description. It then displays any uncategorized “notes,” which in the case of The Emigrants (1793) consist of two additions to the physical description. [Add other examples of “general notes”?] The entry then points ‘outward’ to two “Surrogates”: the microfilm, and the electronic reproduction of the microfilm which is collected in ECCO. A very brief description is made of the work’s content — its subject is “English poetry — 18th century” and its genre/form is “Poems” — which is the only information provided about the work rather than the book. The remainder of the record is an extensive list of libraries which hold copies of the edition, divided into the three geographic regions of “British Isles,” “North America,” and “Other,” followed by a direct link to the ECCO copy referenced above.
This, however, is only how the ESTC displays its contents. Clicking another tab makes visible the MARC tags in which the data itself is stored. The MARC tags encode information at a slightly more refined level of detail. For example, the publication location in the standard view is listed as “Publisher/year” and displayed as the string “London : printed for T. Cadell, in the Strand, 1793.” A human can parse that string, but as the MARC version of the same information reveals, it is made up of three points of information that have been combined. The MARC data is listed as “260,” which is the MARC standard code for “Publication, Distribution, etc.” The line itself is displayed as “|a London : |b printed for T. Cadell, in the Strand, |c 1793” — indicating three separate pieces of information in the subfields “a - Place of publication, distribution, etc.”, “b - Name of publisher, distributor, etc.”, and “c - Date of publication, distribution, etc.” The separation of these points of information in the underlying MARC data is what allows the online database to conduct searches based on publisher, publication location, and date of publication. Even this is a reformatting of the underlying MARC code, which would read “##$a London :$b printed for T. Cadell, in the Strand,$c 1793” — with the two “#” symbols at the beginning encoding that this is the first edition. It is, of course, only sensible for the ESTC to reformat its MARC code for display: MARC stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue, and machines and humans have very different needs as readers. However, what this exploration reveals is that [???].</Text>
            <Comments>There’s a lot more to be examined re: these subject headings, especially if I do topic modelling for contents.

“Because the ESTC was formed from three different projects over many decades, the existence of subject headings varies. For books that are from the periods 1475-1640 (from the original Short-Title Catalogue created by Pollard and Redgrave) and 1641-1700 (from Donald Wing’s short-title catalogue), subject headings exist. But subject headings were not initially created for the eighteenth-century records in the ESTC, and so subject headings rarely occur for the items in ECCO.” (Karian, “Guide” 3)

How many of my records have subject headings? What is the ESTC’s ontology?
Technically, in the “##” sequence, the first “#” encodes that the work is a first edition (as opposed to a “2” for an “intervening” edition or a “3” for the “current” most recent edition), and the second “#” doesn’t encode anything. That position in the MARC record is undefined, with no possible meanings, and simply always contains a ‘blank’ #.
Is it that the categories of information are made less explicit as they are translated for humans, relying on the expert reader’s interpretive skill?</Comments>

            <Text>An edition being “included” in ECCO looks different from its inclusion in the ESTC — whereas the ESTC lists just one record for each multivolume work, ECCO lists each volume separately, with links to the other volumes available in the “full citation” for the volume.

“Such consideration for users is sadly rather less visible with EEBO’s eighteenth-century equivalent ECCO. Unlike EEBO, ECCO presents users with a single, cropped page. In so doing, it has taken the opportunity to remove every blank page that ever appeared in an eighteenth-century book (pace its claim to provide ‘digital images of every page of 150,000 books published during the 18th Century’).” (Gadd 688)

“Unlike EEBO, ECCO includes an underlying text-transcription of its entire collection, which users can search but cannot access in any other way. According to ECCO’s online guide, the full-text transcriptions are generated using computerised ‘optical character recognition’ of the digitised images of [start page 689] each page, with ‘proprietary software created by the vendor to improve OCR accuracy, including the ‘correction’ of old English f/s ligatures and other spelling and character variants’; in addition, there are elaborate quality control systems:
For every digitized page of data, eight specific items are sampled for accuracy and correctness. Each page is visually scanned for glaring errors or omissions. Every 20th page is read in its entirety. (‘About Eighteenth Century Collections Online’)
With this in mind, it comes as somewhat of a surprise to discover that, according to ECCO, the word ‘fuck’ or versions thereof appear over 28,000 times in print in the eighteenth century. Finally, unlike EEBO, feedback from users does not seem to be much valued: the technical support e-mail address provided on its help pages no longer seems to be valid.” (Gadd 688-9)

“In various different ways, ECCO is less open with its users than is usual in academia. It likes to tidy away noisy information. The microfilms on which it is based reproduce images of the openings of books, but ECCO chops each opening into two single-page images and dispenses with all the detail (the rulers placed against type, the blank pages, and the indicators of physical structure) that is so precious to bibliographers. Since 2009, ECCO documents have been supported by MARC descriptions, drawn (presumably) from the ESTC and supplemented by Gale’s own ‘Subject’ entries. Users can search by subject, and yet the MARC files are not directly accessible for checking by readers using ordinary institutional subscriptions. Similarly, there is still no accurate way to identify by class- or shelf-mark the actual copy of a book that ECCO reproduces. An indication of the source collection is always given, but the larger libraries that the original microfilm photographers tended to favor often keep multiple copies of editions, and it is seldom possible to discover which copy has been used without a personal visit to the archive. This omission has several consequences: readers are further distanced from experience of the original material object; local features (such as MS annotations on the original) are inadequately documented; and the widespread phenomenon of stop-press variants within editions of hand-press era books is forgotten. Most frustratingly of all, ECCO does not allow users access to the scanned optical character recognition (OCR) documents that its full-text searches run on.
This secretiveness inevitably arouses suspicions about the accuracy of the scans.” (Bullard 755)

Even when one literary affective mode is at its peak popularity, other opinions are being expressed and other tools are being employed.

            <Title>overall goal</Title>
            <Text>Having described a large and complex scholarly context for this work, and made some preliminary efforts toward synthesis of these disparate backgrounds, it is time, now, to describe the work undertaken here in more detail. This dissertation examines the literature of the 1790s through the lens of ‘titles.’ Throughout this work, a ‘title’ is the broadest possible umbrella term for a text: it is synonymous with ‘a database entry which I believe to represent a printed work.’ I draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), HathiTrust, ProQuest, the British Library’s Nineteenth Century Book Corpus (BL), the Early Novels Database (END), Gale’s digitized microfiche of the Corvey collection, Google Books, the Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg. Each individual database will shape the precise correspondences between a ‘title’ and the printed texts about which I use ‘titles’ to reason. For example, it will vary based on my source whether multiple editions of the same work are several ‘titles’ or one ‘title,’ and whether the titles exclusively represent ‘books’ or also include chapbooks, broadsheets, or even ephemera. Due to the inscrutability of much digital infrastructure, it is often not possible for me to know prior to experimentation what kinds of titles I am working with. These variations form part of my object of inquiry. Substantial time is taken to establish the history and constraints of each of these resources to contextualize the role they play in contemporary digital research. Using the information they make most readily accessible, I explore which works and individuals emerge as ‘popular’ or ‘important’ in each resource. I also probe each resource for its representation of (or failure to represent) my touchstone authors, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson. The resulting findings are primarily used to evaluate how the underlying digital resources participate in or resist the projects of canon-building. Then, there is a ‘turn,’ where I introduce programs of my own design to repurposes these materials. These experiments are then used to draw conclusions about 1790s print culture.</Text>

            <Title>Behrendt - celebrity</Title>
            <Text>“Smith’s continuing presence in the writings of her contemporaries and successors provides a barometer both of her own reputation and, more important, of the varieties of influence and authority she exerted upon the British Romantic literary community. While these writings testify to her poetry’s centrality to the literary culture, they also indicate the paradigmatic value — especially for women writers — of a writer whose personal difficulties were widely known and who achieved commercial success in part because of the skill with which she mythologized her own physical and psychological experience in poems whose evocative power touched the lives and experiences of many contemporaries. This essay examines a range of the responses —  by both canonical writers like Wordsworth and unfamiliar ones like Mariann Dark, Martha Hanson and Thomas Gent — to Smith’s poetry in particular, including public testimonials that appeared in the periodical press following her death. It considers how these responses, which continued into the 1820s, contributed to the myth-making that Smith’s own writings — including the often intensely personal pleading prefaces to her novels — encouraged among writers who read her poetry with care and with empathy. The essay … documents the extensive literary community that was united — at least briefly and circumstantially — through the common theme of Smith and her writing.” (Behrendt 189)

Robinson and Smith both received posthumous attention in 1806-8. Robinson’s reception is negative, dismissing her claims to sympathy and sensibility, and critiquing her immoral personal choices (Behrendt190). Smith is praised for “a familiar catalogue of the characteristics of Smith’s life and work: the pervasive tone of melancholy, the life of illness and suffering, the remarkable productivity in multiple genres.” (Behrendt 191).

“Smith had produced a total of sixty-three volumes, including poetry, novels, translations and books for children” Behrendt(191)

“The tone of the two reviews could not be more different, nor could the moral, political, and ideological judgments that inform them. And yet both authors did in fact suffer physically, emotionally, and certainly economically; both expressed in their works their indignation over the injustice of it all, especially as women trapped in a system which denied them personal and property rights; both suffered reversals in public reputation (and consequently in fortune, or income) when they expressed their political and social dissent; both embodied their personal suffering in their poetry’s (and their prose’s) personae; both died relatively young; both largely disappeared from the landscape of Romantic-era British literary history in the following century and a half; and both have been recovered and favourably assessed in recent decades.” (Behrendt 191)

Mary Robinson’s “notorious public behaviour seems to have ensured that she would not get anything like a fair hearing as an artist among the conventional critics of the time. Her case is a painful reminder of the pervasive power of a self-appointed coterie of predominantly male critics who considered themselves custodians of national public morality.” (192) “unlike Smith she was widely regarded as the instigator rather than the victim of her misfortunes” (192)
“even though… Robinson’s love poems were ‘immensely popular’ during her lifetime [cite: J Labbe “Selling One’s Sorrows” p 70)], her novels sold well, and her Lyrical Tales of 1800 seemed poised to rival the Lyrical Ballads” (192)

She became so inspirational of future great poets that she was forgotten in their shadows..? (193-4)

“The fact is that widespread evidence of Smith’s influence abounds, especially in poems composed during or soon after her lifetime.” (194)
“testify not only to Smith’s pervasive influence on the poetry, but also to the extent to which the Romantic writing community was an interactive and dialogic one in which intertextuality of this sort was clearly deliberate in some cases and probably unintentional in others.” (194)

p 195: men assessed by their work, women by their life first (Robinson dismissed for both simultaneously)

“Because traditional literary history has customarily privileged male writers at the expense of female ones, for much of the last century and a half Smith (like many other women) was routinely relegated to the margins when she was remembered at all. Thus William Lisle Bowles was widely credited with resurrecting the sonnet with the publication of his Fourteen Sonnets in 1789, a misperception to which Coleridge perhaps unintentionally contributed in the Biographia Literaria, where he praises those sonnets without mentioning Smith, whose own sonnets predated Bowles’s by some five years and demonstrably influenced them. At the time, thought, many writers saw matters correctly” (Behrendt 196)

p 196-7: Smith’s strategic persona presenting herself as a damsel in distress to shield from criticism for writing, and indeed to market her writing (all cited from Labbe)

“the memorial poems that we trace to male poets frequently subscribe to the pseudo-chivalric paradigm” often presenting themselves as rescuers, but “poems written by women take a different approach to Smith” (197). “women’s resonate with a much more immediately personal and less hierarchical sense of community, one of emulation, nurturance, and shared experience” (198)

“women readers in general, and women writers in particular, read in Smith’s life and works a different message” (197) “she naturally struck many women as proof positive of the impossibility for even a woman of extraordinary talent, energy, and resilience to ‘make it’. At the same time, however, her life and her undeniable literary achievements reminded those same contemporaries of the nobility — even the heroism — of the struggle she waged” (198)

“Not surprisingly, few authors of the period wrote in much detail about Smith’s direct influences upon their works, although it is clear from sonnets like Bowles’s, Coleridge’s, Wordsworth’s, Opie’s, Hanson’s, Dark’s, Keats’s, and even Anna Seward’s that her influence was wide, formative, and powerful, just as it was in prose fiction for novelists like Austen, Radcliffe, Opie, Scott and others. Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain), while there is no question that her life itself continued to hold real interest for many — and especially for many women — in the first several decades following her death.” (Behrendt 201).

“poetry had always been for her less a commercial venture than a conversation with and among other enlightened minds — both other poets and discriminating readers — in which her participation was not a ‘profession’ (as novel-writing was) but a genuine vocation.” (201)

“It may have taken the better part of two centuries for literary history to prove her correct, but Smith has been vindicated as artist, as thinker and as woman by a new and growing community of sympathy who have once again found in her life and works an irrepressible spirit, keen even in adversity, and a mind and sensibility that is everywhere dedicated to the community of human experience, in all its afflictions and glories. This is the Charlotte Smith whose experience spoke with particular clarity and urgency to nineteenth-century British women, who found in her ability to connect and to articulate her own personal suffering with the ways of the broad public world a consolation, a guide and an inspiration.” (Behrendt 202)</Text>

            <Text>“After their separation Benjamin went into hiding to escape further court proceedings, lived on the interest of his wife's fortune and left her to find means of supporting herself and their nine surviving children. Aware that once a final settlement of the will was brought about, the legacies due would have secured her children's futures, Smith exerted herself to earn sufficient money to pay for legal advice and maintain a genteel standard of living suitable to the expected inheritance. Circumstanced as she was, it is no surprise she described herself a “slave of the Booksellers” (Smith to J. C. Walker, 9 October 1793). And so Smith churned out eleven novels, added to successive editions of the Elegiac Sonnets, produced two further volumes of poetry, and ended her career with the publication of four educational books for young people, a natural history of birds, and a history of England.” (Blank n.pag.)</Text>

            <Text>Is there a way in which this can be said to be, overall, about how texts do or don't 'enter' a 'canon' of writings - by which you mean, as per e.g. Guillory or Bourdieu, and the idea of cultural capital, a set of texts studied, produced, valued (to varying degrees over time) within certain cultural fields, most especially the field of academic research (but also education, modern publishing, creative industries etc). And then your contribution to the many discussions that go on about (and indeed change) canon, is to bring show we can use digital tools to ask and answer that question? I think maybe it is, and if that is the case, then you need to say just that, and that the other issues - timelessness, popularity, marginalization, immediacy, fall out of that larger question… If you frame it like this, and I think I am suggesting you should, it will force you to have a preliminary chapter or part of the introduction where you review terms/concepts like ‘popularity’ or indeed, canon, or ‘marginalization’ - all of which have their own literatures, outside of DH, but also sometimes in or adjacent it (see e.g. the arguments of Lesser, Farmer, Blayney about Shx’s popularity as measured by edition output and print runs - which used some very basic data tools). You need this because at the moment, you just jump into the studies without the framing questions well established. Such a chapter/intro would also enable you to deal directly with the way that other researchers in your fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address these questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading. 

This initial chapter/introduction  I am imagining would also deal with “why 1790s literature” and who else treats the 1790s as a period worthy of cordoning off like this (thus, who your scholarly interlocutors are). 

Finally, you’ve not tried to articulate the queer theory piece here. I think you should, perhaps by thinking with something like this… https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/406/406.pdf. What would be the special character of a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. </Text>

Ian Gadd argues that critiques of digital databases often not based on the right grounds: “the real risk of scholarly misuse of [Early English Books Online] is less to do with the physical features of early printed books that it fails, one way or another, to represent (problematic though these are) and more to do with a lack of an informed knowledge of what exactly EEBO is.” (Gadd 682) The observation applies far beyond EEBO: although it is easiest to critique digital resources for their failures to perfectly replicate the full tactile experience of the books they simulate, or for failing to contain every possible book, those critiques are fundamentally futile. In pursuit of other critiques, this chapter examines the history, textual selection, and implicit model of six databases: the ESTC, ECCO, ECCO-TCP, Project Gutenberg, Google Books, and HathiTrust. I explore how each database encodes its assumptions about what literature is, who it is for, and how it should be used. I historicize these models in the context of the institutional infrastructure behind the creation of each resource, particularly the economic factors driving development. I argue that the differences between each database’s literary model are best understood as the result of different strategies to navigate conflict between commercial and anti-commercial values. In parallel, I follow Charlotte Smith through each of these databases, to explore the impact of their different literary models. Very different works by Smith are available in each resource, and in very different formats. Smith’s most major works are not readily available, suggesting that these literary archives lag behind scholarly consensus about her importance. The chapter concludes with a discussion of new developments in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which can be used to transcribe texts from page images. In evaluating the reliability of various textual transcriptions, alongside existing work on OCR accuracy, I argue that “reliability” is a contextually defined trait rather than an absolute value; whether or not a text is “reliable,” or “reliable enough,” is determined by the intended use of the text. In that light, I describe what circumstances render each database’s transcriptions “reliable.”</Text>

            <Title>Suarez ESTC</Title>
            <Text>WHO SAID THIS ABOUT THIS WORK? “This article should be required reading for those trying to use the ESTC for bibliometric purposes.” — Probably Karian??
Suarez provides an analysis of genre, place of publication, format, length (in sheets), and reprints.
I tender a preliminary analysis of the surviving record of eighteenth-century imprints in Britain and Ireland based on an ordered sampling of the English short-title catalogue (39)
Among the problems one encounters in using the ESTC for data collection and analysis is that it is not a stable database, but rather is constantly growing and changing as it is updated and subject to improvements, additions and corrections.5 The data in this study were collected between 2002 and 2004; while every effort has been made to control for the shifting nature of the database, such accommodations have not always been possible, especially since neither corrections nor / additions to the ESTC are marked as new.6 (At times, one may feel rather like Walter Shandy compiling the Tristapaedia.) (39-40)
Regrettably, although this volume of The Cambridge history of the book in Britain ends in 1830, it is not possible to perform a similarly comprehensive analysis for the first decades of the nineteenth century because we have no equivalent bibliographical control for this period. The nineteenth century short-title catalogue is based on the holdings of a far more limited number of libraries than is the ESTC, and is especially weak in provincial publishing at a time when such publications were increasingly important to local and regional markets.8 Even adding records from Copac ® and the Online Computer Library Centre’s WorldCat would not produce a bibliography with coverage comparable to the ESTC. Other attempts at providing a more thorough conspectus of imprints for the nineteenth century, although valuable, similarly do not have the comprehensive qualities of the ESTC. (40)
One crucial caveat should be considered at the outset: the Eighteenth-century short-title catalogue, as it was, and the English short-title catalogue, as it is now – coverage having been extended retrospectively to the mid-fifteenth century – only records bibliographic information about surviving books.10 After a careful study of book advertisements, inventories and bibliographies, it seems to this investigator that, excluding jobbing and newspaper printing, as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701–1800 has not been incorporated into the ESTC.11 In other words, for up to 10 per cent of the editions printed in the eighteenth century, not a single copy is known to survive. (40)
“These cover all imprints and significant bibliographical variants of books published in the British Isles and Great Britain’s colonial territories (with the addition of the United States of America, 1776–1800) in any language; books published in English, Irish, Gaelic or Welsh elsewhere in the world (for example, the Low Countries, France, Germany); and any imprint falsely claiming to be from London.” (41)
“Lacking the resources to conduct a detailed analysis of the entire ESTC from 1701 to 1800, I have resorted to sampling. Electing to examine all eighteenth-century records that appear in years ending in three – 1703, 1713, 1723 and so on – I have sought to avoid a number of cohort effects, most especially the cumulation of indeterminate records into years ending in ‘0’ or ‘1’ and, to a lesser degree, ‘5’.14 A weakness of many statistical studies of union catalogues is that they do not take this problem into account; one investigation found that nearly one-fifth of all imprints grouped in a given year, 1701, were assigned either by ‘estimation’ / or by ‘internal evidence’ – that is, without the year appearing in an imprint.15 ESTC lumps undated items into the nearest year ending in ‘0’ or ‘5’, so that ‘the peaks in production in such years are therefore to some extent the result of cataloguing practice, rather than increased real output’. “ (41-2)
“In order to determine the number of relevant imprints for analysis, the protocol for this study has been to examine every record in a given year, first sifting out all records that are geographically irrelevant – those coming from the Continent and the American colonies, for example. I have counted in my sample all those records originating in England, Scotland, Wales and, perhaps controversially, Ireland. “ (42)
“p.6: Inspecting and hand-counting individual records has the advantage of allowing the bibliographer to make careful discriminations, even as it introduces a degree of subjectivity (to say nothing of human error) and, hence, guarantees the irreproducibility of exact results. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019” (42)

p.7: In all, I examined 34,335 records, partitioned the non-Britain and non-Ireland imprints, leaving 29,510 records, and recorded 134,732 data points. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019 (43)
p.7: the number of titles per annum exhibits a remarkable rise from a low of 1,744 per annum in 1723 to 6,801 in 1793, an increase of 390 per cent.21 Perhaps surprisingly, the year with the fewest number of imprints is not 1703 but 1723, a fact most probably accounted for by the volatility and instability of financial markets in London, and indeed elsewhere, following the South Sea Bubble financial crisis of 1720. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019 (43)
“It is important to bear in mind that these statistics merely represent numbers of imprints; they do not measure productive output per se because they take into consideration neither sheet counts nor edition quantities. Counting imprints is a deeply flawed way to measure output (to say nothing of produc- tive capacity). The only way, really, to establish an accurate picture is to undertake a sheet count.25 Yet, such a grand analysis simply was not tractable for an investigation using aggregate data from more than 34,000 records – le mieux est l’ennemi du bien.26 “ (44)
“This information was acquired by examining every record for information pertinent to five principal categories: (1) genre, (2) place of publication, (3) bibliographical format, (4) length (in sheets) and (5) reprints and/or repeat publications. “ (44)
“Although sets of protocols for each of these categories were / developed and strictly adhered to, there still is an inescapable element of subjective judgement in this study. In formulating and carrying out this investigation’s design, I have tried to eliminate arbitrariness wherever possible. In the case of genre, for example, where a definitive category could not be determined, the record simply was not counted, rather than make an arbitrary judgement.30 So too, with respect to bibliographical format: if the information available would not allow for a definitive determination, then no entry for that record was tabulated in the format category.31 Nevertheless, such protocols do not free an investigation such as this from the fact that many decisions are perforce made subjectively – and that thousands of such judgements are required. Thus, the results of this study are repeatable, but not exactly so.” (44-45)

“p.9:  I have endeavoured to fashion them in ways that would have been both intelligible to the eighteenth-century ‘common reader’ -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019” (45)
“Examining the category ‘politics, government and law’ … the number of titles more than triples from 1703 / to 1793, but stays essentially the same in terms of its ratio to the whole for each year. … among the categories I have examined, politics, government and law is the most consistent.” (46-7)
“The ‘medicine, mathematics and science’ group is represented by fewer than 50 titles in 1713 (70 titles in 1703); these numbers comprise approximately 2 per cent of the total productive output of the book trade. By 1783, however, that number has increased to 210, or 7 per cent of all records for that year. The 223 titles in 1793 represent a decrease to about 4.4 per cent of the total, but this is probably because of a sharp increase in provincial publishing, which is less likely to produce scientific and mathematical books that often require detailed illustrations and/or complex typesetting. An upward trend in medicine, math- ematics and science publications is clear, and felicitously in accord with our notions about the Enlightenment and its consequent dissemination of scien- tific ideas.33” (47)
“Just as the eighteenth century is a period of intellectual revolution, so too – and indeed no less – is it a time when the financial infrastructure of England and Scotland radically changes.34 It is somewhat surprising, therefore, to note a slight downward trend in the ratio of ‘business and finance’ books to the total output of the trade 1703–53, during which time such titles comprise just 5 per cent of the total. Yet, this trend is markedly reversed from 1763 to 1793, years that exhibit steady rises in both the number and proportion of titles – culmi- nating in 16 per cent of the total recorded for 1793 – and concomitant growth in provincial and London banking, the London stock and money markets, turnpike and other local trusts, joint-stock companies, and industrial investment.35 “ (47)
“By far the most important publishing category at the start of the century is ‘religion, philosophy and ethics’. In 1703, 34 per cent of all titles published belonged to this group. Perhaps surprisingly – considering England’s Erastian state and the importance of books and publishing to religious culture in England, Scotland and Wales more generally – this class of titles exhibits a significant downward trend throughout the century, ending with just 16 per cent of the whole, despite a significant increase in the number of publications in the last decade of our sample. Of course, the number of published titles does / not decrease, but it declines as a proportion of the total. That business and finance publications should in the last decade of the century represent the same proportion of publications as religion, philosophy and ethics is highly surpris- ing and may give credence to then-contemporary worries about growing secularization and the need to effect a religious revival. Nevertheless, as John Barnard has established, such numbers cannot be taken wholly at face value because survival rates for certain kinds of religious publications are remarkably low. “ (47-8)
“The eighteenth century is, famously, the era of ‘the rise of the novel’. We know, for example, that Robinson Crusoe went through six editions of 1,000 copies each in just four months, that Pamela sold approximately 20,000 copies in fourteen months, and that 6,500 copies of Roderick Random came on the market in less than two years.37 Nevertheless, when we examine the numbers of titles published – taking no account of edition sizes – we realize what a small portion of the market fiction actually occupied.38 During the period 1703–53, fiction of all kinds never constitutes as much as 2 per cent of the market (by editions published, not numbers of copies). Even at its height in the eighteenth century, fiction publishing represents slightly less than 3.5 per cent of all surviving titles. This fact may lead some bibliographers and book historians to question the emphasis on fiction publishing that characterizes so much of the work in our field. When viewing fiction as a percentage of the broader category ‘literature, classics and belles-lettres’, throughout the century, novel publishing never makes up more than a quarter of this category and, in 1743, is only around 10 per cent of the total. “ (48) — the lesson about fiction, I think, is that it is notable in the number of copies per title, rather than the number of titles
“p.12: Because their survival rates are so notoriously poor, ‘education and children’s books’ are especially problematic categories for bibliometric analysis. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019” (48) “It seems highly implausible, espe- cially in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, that education and children’s books should never exceed more than 120 per annum, or a high of approximately 3.75 per cent of the total annual output. Although it is true that sometimes the most interesting and important results in an investigation are counter-intuitive, in this instance our knowledge about survival rates strongly suggests that the data for this publishing category are so far off the mark as to be almost completely unreliable.41” (49)
“In much the same vein, when we examine the group of titles belonging to ‘agriculture, almanacs and practical matters’, it seems almost impossible to believe that such books, even if we are only counting titles and not edition quantities, never reached as much as 3.5 per cent of the total annual output, and were so constrained as never to exceed more than 108 editions per annum. Again, the answer lies in the fact that, like school-books and children’s books, the editions in this category are more than usually subject to stochastic pro- cesses.” (49) “Ackers records print runs of between 5,000 and 6,500 for editions dated 1737–47 (after which we have no records), making a total of / 64,000 copies of which only two – one each in 1741 and 1747 – are represented in ESTC, a survival rate of 1:32,000.” (49-50)

p.18: Finally, to some extent the underrepresentation of provincial publishing is an artefact of ESTC cataloguing practices: when a book was published both in London and provincially, the provincial imprint was not always included -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019 (54)

“The answer lies, in part, in the disproportionately high survival rates of large-format books. As Roger Stoddard’s Law reminds us, ‘Bigger books linger longer; little books last least.’70 Folios and, to a lesser extent, quartos tend to persist; octavos and duodecimos – not only because of their size, but also because of the ways they are read and used – commonly perish.” (57) “Folios for Greek and Latin classics, patristic authors, important works of divinity and display bibles were far more likely to be preserved than octavo or duodecimo books whose very size is a bibliographical code suggesting that they are of lesser importance.” (58) “Thus, although randomness certainly plays its part, not all books have an equal chance of survival; format and genre are highly determinative factors.” (58)
— This is a place where “exclusion” does come into play; these lesser works are excluded from contemporary archives/databases because of their format, which itself was not random but tied to social identity

            <Text>Review Reviewed Work(s): Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation by John Guillory Review by: Sharon O'Dair Source: South Atlantic Review, Vol. 59, No. 2 (May, 1994), pp. 130-132 Published by: South Atlantic Modern Language Association Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3200802 
p.130: The debate about the literary canon or the "crisis" in the humanities engages literary critics not only because its resolution may affect the ways we do our work but also because its dissemination attracts public attention in ways few of our debates ever do.
p.130: Without dissenting from the progressive social agenda of liberal pluralism, Guillory attacks both the theoretical assumptions underlying liberal pluralism and the specific approach to curricular reform it has engendered. The pluralist critique of the canon rests upon the notion of representation, with an emphasis on the social identity of the author, who stands for particular social groups and whose writing expresses theideology of that group. As a principle of selection, representation thus replaces aesthetic judgment, which the pluralist critique "is compelled to regard ... as merely fraudulent, as a screen for the covert affirmation of hegemonic values which can be shown to be the real qualification for canonicity in the first place" (270).
p.130: Guillory aims partly to rehabilitate the value of aesthetic judgment, and he dedicates Cultural Capital's concluding chapter to that task. This effort, which one assumes even cultural conservatives will applaud, is predicated, however, on a critique of the mediating function of the school system in the process of canonization and, of course, of judgment.
p.131: The university, especially the research university, is the preserve of an elite; and the function of the lower levels of the school system is to exclude the vast majority of all peoples from access to it, thereby enabling the reproduction of class structures.
p.131: Cultural Capital argues forcefully—and in my view convincingly—that the problem of literary canon formation is best understood not as a problem of biased judgment or as a lack of representation but as “a problem in the constitution and distribution of access to the means of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption” (ix).
p.131: Regardless of race or gender, that is,"[t]hose who have never been taught, or have been very inadequately taught, the practice of reading have little occasion to rejoice at being 'represented’ in the canon” (38)
P.132: More important, perhaps, it reveals the difficulty anyone faces who imagines the dismantling of a system in which he or she holds a position of privilege.</Text>

            <Text>“while ESTC may be based on two thousand public and private libraries worldwide, the Eighteenth Century microfilm series is based on books from only a tiny fraction of that number - almost certainly less than twenty libraries, and rarely anywhere other than the British Library, the Bodleian, Harvard, and the Hunt” (Spedding 440)

The “microfilm series is not a random - and therefore randomly representatve— selection of items from ESTC. Texts have been selected for filming on the basis of criteria that are rarely mentioned, but which include ease of access for filming (initially, items at the British Library) and the desire to avoid duplication of texts. That is, by the desire to get the biggest bang for Gale’s buck.” (Spedding 441)

“There may also be commercial considerations at work. Alt not conducted a systematic search for items from the British L Case" (its collection of erotic material), it seems that little of tha the Eighteenth Century microfilm series, and the material that h has only been quite recently added.37 Consequently, much of this ing from ECCO. The reason for this may be that much Private Ca as late as 1989, not represented on ESTC,38 but it may also be be Private Case was microfilmed by Adam Matthew Publications in under the title Sex and Sexuality 1 640-1 940 . That is, the eighteent terial in the Private Case may have been withheld from the Eigh microfilm series (and consequently ECCO) to ensure the profitab Sexuality. Similar, and similarly hidden, criteria seem to affect o such as EEBO and Goo” (Spedding 441)

Gale proudly declares that “this collection contains every significant English-language and foreign-language title printed in the United Kingdom between the years 1701 and 1800.” (“Eighteenth Century Collections Online”) This claim is easily overturned with a single counterexample, such as the first edition of Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets, a significant title which is absent.

“Full-text searching across all 26 million pages enables users to explore a vast range of books and directories, bibles, sheet music, sermons, advertisements, and works by both celebrated and lesser-known authors. Researchers will also find rare works from women writers of the eighteenth century, collections on the French Revolution, and numerous editions of the works of Shakespeare.” (Gale, “Part I”)</Text>

hbbo reminds me of several chapters of that lesbian history by emma donoghue [Passions Between Women] I was reading a month or so ago
me oh! tell me more!
hbbo she talks a lot about how, like
hbbo the fact that a text that represents or misrepresents woman-woman desire, in a lot of ways, fundamentally hostile to that desire or AT THE VERY LEAST extremely ill-informed about it, doesn't mean that historical same-sex-attracted women didn't gain value from those texts, even if that value required different kinds of readings than intended
me ohhh, yeah! yeah, that's a perfect example, I think</Text>

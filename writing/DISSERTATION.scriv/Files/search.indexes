            <Title>model 2: ECCO-TCP</Title>
            <Text>I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.</Text>

            <Title>model 3: reading</Title>
            <Text>Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.</Text>

            <Title>what to teach: convo with Jack</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts. Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.</Text>

            <Title>Coleridge wrote "We Are Seven"</Title>
            <Text>“My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-'A little child, dear brother Jim,' —I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jim.” (WW)

And it’s even an IN JOKE, and he uses the stanza just as Coleridge wrote it, deleting the joke without replacing it with anything!! This is not transcendent inspiration and individual genius. (He had long left behind the mountain and the girl when he wrote; he was thinking about tea time!)

— It is perfectly fine to be thinking about tea time; the poem is still wonderful. But the myth simply doesn’t work.</Text>

Although much of Drucker’s discussion of our contemporary relationship to visual interfaces is tangential to this project, her monograph includes a highly-relevant discussion of the use of data visualizations in varying disciplines. This discussion expands on her 2011 article “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” (Digital Humanities Quarterly 5.1) to highlight the importance of avoiding a false appearance of observer-independent objective truth in humanities visualizations. Her warnings will continue to shape my own creation and use of visualizations as I seek to make sense of my large bodies of information.

The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics.

            <Text>I am not sure what I now know about Charlotte Smith that I didn't before, but I feel like I know something. Mostly, I think, spreading all these poems out in my timeline helps to clarify that Elegiac Sonnets (like Tristram Shandy!) is not actually a single unified work representing one moment of time, but rather an assemblage that can react to the events it shapes. The re-introduction of chronological gaps makes it easier to identify where she is developing her thoughts or changing her mind, and highlights the trial-and-error of her experiments as sets of poems are entered into the record.</Text>

This collection of essays recaptures the development in Moretti’s career of his theories of literary history as evolutionary and as an imbalanced center-periphery system of exchange, alongside his increasing use of computational methods that come to be known as ‘distant reading.’ Moretti’s interest in accounting for the “great unread” of literature, and his use of computational models to carry out comparative research, provides much of the theoretical background for my own methods. </Text>

Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.</Text>

O’Quinn discusses three particular performances of Joseph Addison’s Cato (1713) and a famous 1812 portrait of John Philip Kemble in the role of Cato, in order to compare each production’s allegory of George III’s political position and to make a broader argument about the use of partially forgetting the past when re-staging history. O’Quinn’s article, like the majority of those in this special issue of Eighteenth-Century Fiction, thus models the examination of literary work in context with its moment and with other forms of artistic production </Text>

            <Text>Minard is actually making a strong and brutal argument in his chart -- against war, against Napoleon, and against history as the biography of celebrity. I need to do a lot of actual research first, to figure out what I think is true, and why I think it, but I will know that I have succeeded, I think, if I can produce something half so rich and persuasive.

Right now this means that I am throwing out my current dissertation outline, which separates things based on which corpus I am pulling my information from. I will describe my methods in the most voluminous appendices the department has ever seen if I must (and I strongly suspect that, in the end, I must) but I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.

I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.</Text>

Memoralizing, too, is cyclical: “And now, where Caesar saw with proud disdain / The wattled hut and skin of azure stain, / Corinthian columns rear their graceful forms, / And light varandas brave the wintry storms, / While British tongues the fading fame prolong / Of Tully's eloquence and Maro's song.”

Perhaps, she says, long ages past away, 
And set in western waves our closing day, {120} 
Night, Gothic night, again may shade the plains 
Where Power is seated, and where Science reigns; 
England, the seat of arts, be only known 
By the gray ruin and the mouldering stone; 
That Time may tear the garland from her brow, {125} 
And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now. 
   Yet then the ingenuous youth whom Fancy fires 
With pictured glories of illustrious sires, 
With duteous zeal their pilgrimage shall take 
From the blue mountains, or Ontario's lake, {130} 
With fond adoring steps to press the sod 
By statesmen, sages, poets, heroes trod

…

  But who their mingled feelings shall pursue 
When London's faded glories rise to view? 
The mighty city, which by every road, 
In floods of people poured itself abroad; {160} 
Ungirt by walls, irregularly great, 
No jealous drawbridge, and no closing gate; 
Whose merchants (such the state which commerce brings) 
Sent forth their mandates to dependant kings; 
Streets, where the turban'd Moslem, bearded Jew, {165} 
And woolly Afric, met the brown Hindu; 
Where through each vein spontaneous plenty flowed, 
Where Wealth enjoyed, and Charity bestowed. 
Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet 
Each splendid square, and still, untrodden street; {170} 
Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time, 
The broken stair with perilous step shall climb, 
Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round, 
By scattered hamlets trace its antient bound, 
And, choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey {175} 
Through reeds and sedge pursue his idle way. 
  With throbbing bosoms shall the wanderers tread 
The hallowed mansions of the silent dead, 
Shall enter the long isle and vaulted dome 
Where Genius and where Valour find a home; {180} 
Awe-struck, midst chill sepulchral marbles breathe, 
Where all above is still, as all beneath; 
Bend at each antique shrine, and frequent turn 
To clasp with fond delight some sculptured urn, 
The ponderous mass of Johnson's form to greet, {185} 
Or breathe the prayer at Howard's sainted feet. 

…

Oft shall the strangers turn their eager feet {205} 
The rich remains of antient art to greet, 
The pictured walls with critic eye explore, 
And Reynolds be what Raphael was before. 
On spoils from every clime their eyes shall gaze, 
Egyptian granites and the Etruscan vase; {210} 
And when midst fallen London, they survey 
The stone where Alexander's ashes lay, 
Shall own with humbled pride the lesson just 
By Time's slow finger written in the dust. </Text>

This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expand- ing audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3

            <Synopsis> Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.

Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.</Synopsis>

            <Title>"On the Supernatural in Poetry"</Title>
            <Text>“Oh, I should never be weary of dwelling on the perfection of Shakspeare, in his management of every scene connected with that most solemn and mysterious being, which takes such entire possession of the imagination, that we hardly seem conscious we are beings of this world while we contemplate ‘the extravagant and erring spirit.' The spectre departs, accompanied by natural circumstances as touching as those with which he had approached. It is by the strange light of the glow-worm, which ‘'gins to pale his ineffectual fire ;' it is at the first scent of the morning air–the living breath, that the apparition retires. There is, however, no little vexation in seeing the ghost of Hamlet played. The finest imagination is requisite to give the due colouring to such a character on the stage; and yet almost any actor is thought capable of performing it. In the scene where Horatio breaks his secret to Hamlet, Shakspeare, still true to the touch of circumstances, makes the time evening, and marks it by the very words of Hamlet, ‘Good even, sir,' which Hanmer and Warburton changed, without any reason, to ‘good morning,' thus making Horatio relate his most interesting and solemn story by the clear light of the cheerfullest part of the day; when busy sounds are stirring, and the sun itself seems to contradict every doubtful tale, and lessen every feeling of terror. The discord of this must immediately be understood by those who have bowed the willing soul to the poet.””</Text>

“It was in ths room that we found a little worn-out copy of the Seasons, lying in a window seat, on which Coleridge exclaimed, ‘That is true fame!’ He said Thompson was a great poet, rather than a good one; his style was as meretricious as his thoughts were natural. He spoke of Cowper as the best modern poet. He said the Lyrical Ballads were an experiment about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been attempted, and making use only of such words as had probably been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.”</Text>

Rules about conclusions: • You should draw your conclusions solely from the discussion chapter. • There should be little further discussion in the conclusions chapter. • The conclusions should respond to the aim stated in the first chapter. • Summaries are not conclusions. • Conclusions should be crisp and concise. • The conclusions can be used to briefly explore the implications of your findings.</Synopsis>

            <Text>The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact.

            <Text>Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’</Text>

And bids soft leaves his glittering prize enfold,

            <Title>background</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.</Text>

            <Title>OGS Plan of Study (3,950 chars)</Title>
            <Text>Digital Humanities research in literary studies is entering a new stage, less starstruck by the sheer quantity of material available and more attentive to the bibliographic detail that constitute its quality. Katherine Bode’s forthcoming article exemplifies this shift, critiquing the “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers for too often disregarding the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as stable and objective, Bode argues, it is no different than New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.
I have narrowed my focus to an eleven-year “decade,” defined by the French Revolution, in order to make my voracious scope feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period themselves anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England: this number triples, to forty-eight thousand works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. Somewhat contentiously, I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.
To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading, corpus stylistics, bibliographic research, and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four main collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired digitcal bibliographic records for 51,965 works from 1789-99 listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewehere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, thus enabling more detailed computational exploration of its subject matter. Finally, I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These key authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically, successfully, and influentially during the 1790s, but who are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon. Throughout the project, I will expand my focus beyond the novels and poems which generally occupy literary attention, to consider pamphlets, songs, theatrical productions, and other ephemeral printed works, to encompass the period’s full breadth.
The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. [Do I need to explicitly state what I will do in the fifth year? Words are precious.] My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.</Text>

            <Text>Harley's encounter at Bedlam, in general, relates to the rest of the work in unexpected ways. The encounter itself is exactly the kind of thing I expected from a book titled Man of Feeling: Harley is uninterested in his friends' fashionable entertainments, but agrees to go along on a tour of the Bedlam asylum (which was, uh, a common place to tour for amusement); at the asylum, he sees a beautiful and ladylike woman with a tragic backstory that has induced in her a whimsical and nonthreatening sort of madness; this sets her apart from the other, repulsive inmates of the asylum, and Harley is moved to effusive tears at her distress. His tears inspire pity in his friends and their tour guide as well, opening their eyes to new frontiers of sympathetic feeling, and the madwoman gives him a memento to remember her by.
Then he leaves and never mentions her again. And I found myself noticing that his character trait of "feeling" was fairly sudden. A lot of book happens before our protagonist leads us in a round of tears!
[Are the other parts of the novel meant to demonstrate “feeling” also? Because they really just look like naievete.]</Text>

That from the dawn of humanity, high status men, removed from the drudge work of life, have enjoyed long, uninterrupted hours of leisure. And in that time, they created art, philosophy, literature, they made scientific discoveries and sank into what psychologists call the peak human experience of flow. Women aren’t expected to flow. I read feminist leisure research (who knew such a thing existed?) and international studies that found women around the globe felt that they didn’t deserve leisure time. It felt too selfish. Instead, they felt they had to earn time to themselves by getting to the end of a very long To Do list. Which, let’s face it, never ends. I began to realise that time is power.

            <Text>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.</Text>

            <Title>long history of using songs to be popular</Title>
            <Text>I've been thinking a lot about songs. As far as I can tell, in the 1820s, poets have been boldly revitalizing poetry by publishing edited versions of popular songs for at least fifty years.

The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects. But, seeing Wordsworth and Coleridge as participants in a literary conversation also makes them more interesting again, so I can forgive them their propaganda and just focus on how interesting it is that Wordsworth's 1798 "The Thorn" has so much in common with Hannah More's 1796 "Ballad of Robert and Richard" (both of them are trying to 'elevate' ghost stories above vulgar superstition, for the improvement of their audiences, but with completely different ideas as to what that entails).

The second part of "thinking a lot about songs" involves a leap of several hundred years: Jo Walton is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning writer, and she says that "the single most quoted thing I have ever written" is... a limerick she posted in a usenet newsgroup in 1998, "The Lurkers Support Me In Email," to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean.” I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find that Hannah More has also written a morally-improving ballad to that tune (or, if she hasn't, it's only because the song is too associated with Jacobins), and certainly her other songs all mention specific tunes which she assumes I will already know.

So there's something interesting to me, here, about the idea of layering your words over top of pattern someone else already knows, as a way to get your version to stick more easily in people's heads. I don't think Jo Walton was intentionally trying to write something extremely memorable, but Hannah More certainly was.</Text>

            <Title>critical context</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. </Text>

            <Title>Wordsworth &amp; More</Title>
            <Text>let’s see, looking though my notes — looks like William Wordsworth writes a ton of poems that are just incredibly pretentious versions of Hannah More’s stories/ballads
Alex: “has that been said before. god I hate wordsworth
such a mansplainer
so that would be a great topic”
Michael Gamer has said, essentially, that Wordsworth is writing more pretentious versions of popular ghost stories
Alex: “proving that he is one of those dudes in a meeting who repeats what the woman said but louder
but no one Hannah More especially?”
no, Hannah More hates ghost stories for the same reason Wordsworth does — they are vulgar and unchristian
but she uses them anyway, the same way wordsworth does
to subvert them into morally improving tales
or, well, WW is less clear w/ moral improvement of individual poems
but Gamer makes a compelling argument re: his overall claim to have “elevated” his material
Alex: “is there room to argue against Gamer, or to move it in another direction then?”
I don’t know that More is a specific source for Wordsworth; it’s not impossible, but also not immediately likely to me. What interests me is the similarity of their rhetorical stance toward their material and their shared mission of “elevating” for moral improvement, contrasted with their success — Wordsworth has got everybody buying his propaganda, More not so much
Alex: “well, he is a dude.......
but I see the question, and how it relates to the question about 1790s you have formulated...
certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business.”
hmmm.. Gamer is mostly making a broader argument about the Gothic as the immediate source for Romanticism, whereas More is essentially orthogonal to Romanticism…
(I agree with &amp; really like Gamer’s argument about the Gothic &amp; Romanticism)
More want to repurpose and “elevate” the Gothic for essentially evangelical Christian ends — it is astonishing how much I like her, really, given that she is the perfect precursor to all those meddling Victorian moralist middle-class ladies
Alex: “right, but you are still seeing something new there, about More, that both fits in with an is distinct from Gamer - and is core to your questions about your period”
yeah, I think I would use Gamer as a leaping-off point to pursue this slightly separate track, about other attempts to elevate/repurpose popular writing
Alex: “sounds chapter-able. very good.”</Text>

It would make current ways of teaching inconvenient, but perhaps in productive ways: if you wanted to read a bunch of poems by one author, students would have to skip past the other writing that was produced in between, a tangible reminder of the time that actually did separate those works.

            <Title>no longer considering scales as different models</Title>
            <Text>My initial thesis proposal proposed approaching my decade of interest by examining three different “models” of different levels of detail: “One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.”
I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.</Text>

            <Title>debt vs credit</Title>
            <Text>It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit
It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing to promise repayment) and then 80% of the time we’re told that he did follow up and repay
Are the screeds against debt in the same works...? I’ll have to check, but I THINK there’s a distinction being made between “credit” (which is tied to social credibility) and “debt” (which is seen as impersonal and with near-mystical properties)
Similarly peasants can live like 5 years in a cottage without paying rent and they’ll get around to it when the landlord asks them, and this too is not “debt”, in fact at the start of the century it’s a narrative marker of cruelty for the landlord to insist on the rent being paid
Ok, those are my thoughts on credit vs debt as part of the shift from parochial economies to imperial market capitalism</Text>

            <Text>Does a work get listed according it its composition? (Beginning of first composition, or end of last revision?) Its first publication? But “publication” doesn’t apply to works that circulated widely in manuscript form — date from the first time a copy was “distributed” to someone other than the author? (What about, e.g., Percy editing Frankenstein? Other manuscript works were surely revised in response to feedback, but Mary giving Percy a copy doesn’t feel like “publication”.)
Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren’t likely to be fully useful. I like first publication to reflect when the work became less inchoate and entered into a broader literary conversation — this is the point at which chronological connections seem most likely to be informative.</Text>

            <Text>A chronological anthology is structured by the assuption that the most important context for a work is not who it is by, but when it was produced. Author comes second. This reverses the traditional anthology (Norton etc), which is structured by the assumption that the most important context for a work is the author who produced it, with chronology as a second concern.
Author is of course an important component! But it can also promote the false idea that changes within an author’s body of work are mostly due to personal matters or artistic evolution, rather than being responses to other works being produced or to changes in the world at large. </Text>

            <Text>“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)
“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)
“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and tht there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

“The "favorite authors" are all women: Anna Maria Bennett, Regina Maria Roche, Elizabeth [sic] Meeke, Agnes Musgrave, Anna Howell, Mary Charlton, Isabella Kelly, Elizabeth Parsons, Elizabeth Bonhote, and Anna Maria M’Kenzie.” (39)

"Lane claims "All the Works complete of Robertson, Johnson, Henry, Hume, Locke, Pope, Rapin, Goldsmith, Milton, Smollett, Richardson, Garrick, Gibbons, Voltaire, Addison, Rollin, Littleton, Sterne, Shakespeare, Bolingbroke, Fielding, &amp;c.," as well as “every Author of the present Age”” (40)

"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels."

“At the Minerva Press, William Lane, who had printed 11 items in the 1770s and 131 in the 1780s, produced 402 in the 1790s.” (48)

"Of a total of 1036 works published between 1790 and 1820, on average 27% are texts other than novels. ... these texts include 67 different types of compilations, including collections of maxims, sermons, hymns, fairy tales, fables, songs, jokes, and travel accounts, as well as 52 books of instruction on a wide range of subjects including spelling, cooking, brewing, parenting, farriery, medicine, and military matters.” (52)

“works may be classified in more than one category. Thus, a work may appear in two categories within a table (as in both epistolary and sentimental) or be listed in both tables (as in translation and courtship).” (56)

￼(57)

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

“Kirwan praises Ward Elliot and Robert Valenza’s “call for acknowledgement of uncertainty (a productive agnosticism rather than a reactionary atheism or unquestioning faith),” concluding the section with the dictum that “critics should be as willing to lose Shakespeare as to find him””
“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””
“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha. In so doing, Kirwan proposes to continue destabilizing the monolithic “Shakespeare,” a project he traces back two decades.”
“a startlingly diffuse, unexpectedly consistent corpus of plays linked by company ownership, rather than by what he argues is the anachronism of authorial ownership.
Motivated to trouble “post-Romantic ideals of individual authorship””
“Boldly, he offers agnosticism to replace the “did-didn’t binary.” This yields “the possibility of Shakespeare’s contribution” to Locrine (137) or a proposed differentiation between “Shakespearean” and “by Shakespeare” (161). This third chapter may inflame more controversy than anything else in the book.”
“the field of attribution studies desperately needs critical metacognitive appraisals of its methods, its successes, and its failures. Kirwan’s assessment of and engagement with attribution studies ought to be cited for years to come”
“Having proven the constructedness of “Canon” and “Apocrypha,” having demonstrated the viability of collaboratively created drama, and having questioned the use and availability of “certain” attributions, Kirwan performs his crowning disruption—to “redefine the meanings of both ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘complete’ in a bid to offer multiple configurations of canon” (205). Here and throughout, Kirwan affirms canons, not a Canon.”
“Kirwan’s final chapter models alternative canon-writing practices as evidence of the potentiality of multivalent canons “to provide options instead of answers” dependent upon audiences’ critical participation”</Text>

This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.</Text>

            <Text>My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.
I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” </Text>

p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017

p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017

p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017

p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: the -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: erage date of composition of the first is 1757 and the second is 1775. These results suggest that the language of aesthetic compositionexperiences a substantive change within the eighteenth century and, moreover, give us a chronological outline through which we can begin to -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: pinpoint these transformations -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  these chronological limits coincide with the beginnings of the radical increase in -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017

p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017

p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017

p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017

p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: hmm -- I've been trying to resist my impulses toward tidy clustering; sometimes text are outliers, and a long tail is to be expected.. not everything reduces down to a few categories -- Written May 2, 2017

            <Text>Sandvoss, C. (2007). The death of the reader: literary theory and the study of texts in popular culture. In Gray, J. A., Sandvoss, C., &amp; Harrington, C. L. (Eds.). Fandom: Identities and communities in a mediated world. NYU Press.

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

http://doctornerdington.tumblr.com/post/161275412738/if-we-cannot-locate-aesthetic-value-of-texts-in
In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.
What do you think?
(via fanhackers)
“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!
I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.
Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

Whenever the parser encounters a stage direction, it parses that direction to determine whether it includes a character entrance or exit and thus demarcates a new block. Within each block, the parser uses speaker tags and parsed stage directions to determine who is on stage for that block, and keeps a running tally of how many words each character has spoken. At the end of the block, the connections within that block are recorded and the next block begun.</Text>

It is about the finding of a glow-worm for ‘Lucy’ to see. ‘The incident’, wrote W when he copied it out to send to C that same night on reaching Grasmere, ‘took place about seven years ago between Dorothy and me’ (EY, p. 348). The gesture was delicate at Racedown in 1795, and the poem about it is particularly delicate in Apr. 1802; it clearly did reassure D that W’s intended marriage would mean no diminution of his love for her.</Text>

            <Text>	•	Main ingredients in plan of study (OGS) or program of work (SSHRC) should include (besides those indicated in the instructions):
	◦	Statement of a theoretical problem rooted in the sociological literature. Be clear about the theoretical paradigm you are using, but be relatively brief to leave space for a concrete description of your research project.
	▪	General examples of theoretical problems: a logical contradiction that has not been resolved between two theoretical propositions; an implication of social theory that has not been tested empirically or that can be tested in a new way; a theoretical issue that is outstanding; a social phenomenon that raises theoretical issues.
	◦	Statement of a researchable substantive topic, problem, or question formulated at a more concrete level than the theoretical problem, but should in some sense be derived from it.
	◦	Critical review of a relevant literature and the way in which the theoretical problem and substantive research topic emerge out of, and address, a gap in the literature. Pay attention to alternative theoretical paradigms and orientations in the literature. Make sure you know the substantive empirical literature in the subject area of your thesis or dissertation. Be relatively brief.
	◦	Selection and justification of sources of empirical data. This is necessary whether you use historical documents, qualitative field or interview data, survey data., or some other data source.
	◦	Statement of the methodology. What is the logic of your research design? Does your choice of data collection and analysis fit logically and sociologically with your statements of the theoretical problem and substantive topic?
	◦	Statement of the research techniques to be used, such as questionnaires and interview schedules in the data collection, and statistical or qualitative techniques in the data analysis.
	◦	Schedule for data collection, analysis, and write-up. Show that this is reasonable within the time allotted to complete the degree.
	◦	Likely interpretation of the data you expect to find.
	◦	Contribution of your thesis to the advancement of knowledge. How it helps to tell us something we did not know before, or helps to fill a gap in the literature. Will it change the way people in the field look at a question? This should relate back to your statement of the theoretical problem.
	◦	All of this in a page (OGS) or two pages + references (SSHRC)!
	◦	Conform to the font and page-format requirements. For both SSHRC and OGS: single-spaced (no more than 6 lines per inch), no smaller than 12-point font (Times New Roman font for SSHRC), and no smaller than 3/4-inch margins! See the SSHRC and OGS web sites for further information about attachments to your application.

1. THE GLOW-WORM,
1.
BENEATH the hedge, or near the stream,
A worm is known to stray;
That shews by night a lucid beam,
Which disappears by day.
2.
Disputes have been and still prevail
From whence his rays proceed;
Some give that honour to his tail,
And others to his head.
Page  336
3.
But this is sure—the hand of might
That kindles up the skies,
Gives him a modicum of light,
Proportion'd to his size.
4.
Perhaps indulgent nature meant
By such a lamp bestow'd,
To bid the trav'ler, as he went,
Be careful where he trod:
5.
Nor crush a worm, whose useful light
Might serve, however small,
To shew a stumbling stone by night,
And save him from a fall.
6.
Whate'er she meant, this truth divine
Is legible and plain,
'Tis power almighty bids him shine,
Nor bids him shine in vain.
Page  337
7.
Ye proud and wealthy, let this theme
Teach humbler thoughts to you,
Since such a reptile has its gem,
And boasts its splendour too.

            <Text>“the gaps between “the published” (all literary works in history), “the archive” (the portion of what was published that has been preserved and is now increasingly digitized), and “the corpus” (the segment of the archive selected for a particular research question)” (Bode )

In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole

Hypothesis: If I can marry computational methods with scholarly/bibliographical/something attention to detail, I can “account for” the full variety AND scale of what was produced, and thus properly detect intergeneric / hybrid works / writers. [I think that, as the literary mediascape fractured and specialized, authors wrote “to” specific audiences.] [I also, more importantly, think that the pressures of rabid change during the apocalyptic french revolution introduced timeliness as an important quality of a literary work — even non political and non pamphlet publications needed to be responsive]

	•	Although I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will research them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many 
	•	disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be said to be “representative” of this decade? And what do they “represent”?

Contribution to the advancement of knowledge: [cool new information about the literature of revolution and social upheaval; cool new information about some interesting writers; a methodology that can be scaled up chronologically to apply similar detail-oriented  ]

            <Text>Frow, John. Genre. New York: Routledge, 2015. Print.
John Frow articulates genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.</Text>

            <Title>model 1: ESTC</Title>
            <Text>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 
I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.</Text>

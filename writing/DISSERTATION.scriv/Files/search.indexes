            <Title>DH gets left out</Title>
            <Text>The Digital Humanities
Timeliness and feeling, as investigated through bibliographical research and reparative reading, thus chart a tangled network of interrelated concepts. Reparative reading requires an openess to the multiplicity of meaning which works may accrue as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and adapated in response to the pressures of timeliness. Precise bibliographical research can recapture and contextualize the complex and variable strategies of feeling that competed throughout the period. Not yet integrated into this set of priorities and methodological frameworks is the element of my project which often requires the most justification: my use of quantitative and computational methodologies.</Text>

            <Text>(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of all literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone else’s job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong.

            <Title>ch 2 - fame and legacy</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “seriousness” of their reputations. Influenced by Ashley J. Cross’s “From Lyrical Ballads to Lyrical Tales: Mary Robinson's Reputation and the Problem of Literary Debt,” I am interested in exploring the careers of Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as my “case study” for this chapter. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for “popularity,” “celebrity,” and “legacy” which are both fruitful and nuanced. In addition to reading the extensive literature grappling with these concerns for individual authors, I am currently thinking of ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. I may also add scholarly uptake (perhaps through the proxy of  JSTOR articles, since JSTOR makes their archive accessible for experiments of this type) as a particular sub-type of “legacy.”</Text>

            <Text>Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.</Text>

            <Text>This is mostly a talk about how difficult it is to find out what's actually in a digital archive. Because it's digital, we expect accessibility/convenience, but often what digitality actually enables is a black box. The goal of my work, which is still extremely preliminary, is to take a small enough slice of "big data" that I can actually examine it carefully, and to scrutinize it.

My work as a digital humanities scholar right now 


data collection
even though "MARC" stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue," at points I read these records with my feeble human eyes

titles per year
- this was unreasonably difficult to make; OpenRefine was the secret
- TCP is the most unbalanced -- though that may be because it also includes Evans texts

publisher location
ESTC shows more published in Edinburgh than in Scotland
(210 Edinburgh, 52 Scotland)
Neither of these includes Ireland right now -- ESTC because it's not in my query, ECCO because I deleted Ireland to match ESTC

ECCO stats are based on the 37,830 MARC records which include publisher location
Somewhat inexplicably, 27,140 MARC records don't include bibliographical publisher assessment, just a transcription of the title page
(I also have 25,000 more MARC records than I expected so I have some more correlating to do.)

            <Text>“I came to learn that women have never had a history or culture of leisure. (Unless you were a nun, one researcher later told me.) That from the dawn of humanity, high status men, removed from the drudge work of life, have enjoyed long, uninterrupted hours of leisure. And in that time, they created art, philosophy, literature, they made scientific discoveries and sank into what psychologists call the peak human experience of flow. Women aren’t expected to flow. I read feminist leisure research (who knew such a thing existed?) and international studies that found women around the globe felt that they didn’t deserve leisure time. It felt too selfish. Instead, they felt they had to earn time to themselves by getting to the end of a very long To Do list. Which, let’s face it, never ends. I began to realise that time is power. That time is a feminist issue.”

            <Title>ch 2 - mainstream press</Title>
            <Text>Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade.
One thread of inquiry is simply to recover contemporary printing practices: who was printing what, and when? What role do chapbooks and religious tracts play? Do our archives simply replicate the output of the major publishing houses?
 Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? If possible, I would also like to examine theatrical production through this framework. Given the heightened ephemerality of theatre, it seems likely that the re-staging of an older play will be even more interestingly shaped by its potential to provide a timely response to the context in which it is re-staged.
A second thread of inquiry shaped by this attention to mainstream print production is to examine celebrity via print culture. Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather that nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare how famous various literary celebrities were over the course of the decade. The technical challenge for this part of the project is to define a feasible and fruitful metric of celebrity. In addition to looking at various raw publication counts, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. I will also discuss popularity more generally: after developing a few different metrics for popularity, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? Why does one corpus show one popular thing, and another show another?</Text>

            <Text>My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see how much we do know about the chapbook trade. I am particularly interested in the cycle of responses between pamphlets, and whether there are geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness. This chapter will of course address Hannah More’s Cheap Repository Tracts, but I am equally curious about the works among which hers were sold. My “case study” could trace the printing and circulation of one of More’s pamphlets and a few of its fellow-travellers, as the foundation for a discussion of More’s hybrid literary forms. </Text>

The Digital Archive and Print Politics, 1789–99

My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like--in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers-- and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested in print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.
My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will establish, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are developing anti-oppressive and less “extractive” digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own research. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this eleven-year “decade” to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s will highlight the decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women writers. Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth-century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant  literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth-century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history began to be interpreted into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.
Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring  it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions in situations where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.
Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. I will examine individual works and individual authors,  Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as "popular literature”.
Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.
Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical--or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream”--printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a set of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, in context with the print production which they are alternatives to. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me with two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices with the horizon of expectations within the radical circles I expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.
A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work  suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a Gothic parody from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary productions are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.</Text>

            <Text>So while the full.tsv contains records for works published as early as 1660 and as late as 1853, you can choose the 18c-full.tsv to look only at records published from 1700-1799, and the 19c-full.tsv for records with publication dates from 1800-1853.

About the Dataset
The Early Novels Dataset contains bibliographic metadata for early works of fiction held in the Collection of British and American Fiction, 1660-1830 (CBAF) at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, as well as other regional repositories. It consists of MARC catalog records enriched with custom subfields designed to offer new kinds of structured data about early fiction in English.

The END dataset is comprised of high-quality, human-generated metadata that captures a much fuller range of edition- and copy-specific information about early novels than traditional library catalog records. The END metadata schema builds on library-standard MARC records with custom-designed subfields that use both controlled and discursive vocabularies to describe a range of bibliographic features outside the scope of traditional cataloging. These include important bibliographic details such as authority statements, full and half title, accurate and controlled place of publication, and edition statement. They capture both copy-specific information about marginalia, inscriptions, and bookplates as well as title-level data on narrative form. And finally, they record the presence of important paratextual features like authors’ notes, epigraphs, footnotes, and indices, which can be found in many works of early fiction but have never been cataloged in a systematic way that would enable faceted search across a corpus.

As of September 2017, the complete Early Novels Dataset totals 2,041 records. The core eighteenth-century subset consists of 1,325 records, which represent all of Penn Libraries’ Collection of British and American Fiction holdings published from 1700-1794 and a sampling of holdings published from 1795-1799. A sample comparison of the CBAF holdings from the decade of the 1760s with all known fiction in English published during this period suggests that Penn's collection represents approximately 14% of this total corpus. In the core eighteenth-century subset, Penn's holdings are supplemented with selected holdings from other Philadelphia-area and regional repositories, including the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach, the Swarthmore Libraries Rare Book Room, Bryn Mawr College Special Collections, and New York University's Fales Library.

Pair END Data with Fulltext for Topic Modeling
While END’s primary focus is metadata, we are also in the preliminary stages of a fulltext initiative for the CBAF novels digitized by Penn Libraries and available through Print at Penn. We have created fulltext files for each of these texts using OCR; cleanup work is ongoing, both computationally and through hand-correcting. The fulltext is available in our digital-collection repostiory. We have also worked with Penn Libraries' Digital Humanities Specialist Scott Enderle to experiment with topic modeling of this fulltext combined with END metadata. Work-in-progress can be found in our earlynovels-topic-model repository, and Scott's enhanced Topic Modeling Tool, which enables pairing fulltext with metadata, can be found here.</Text>

            <Title>debt vs credit</Title>
            <Text>It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit
It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing to promise repayment) and then 80% of the time we’re told that he did follow up and repay
Are the screeds against debt in the same works...? I’ll have to check, but I THINK there’s a distinction being made between “credit” (which is tied to social credibility) and “debt” (which is seen as impersonal and with near-mystical properties)
Similarly peasants can live like 5 years in a cottage without paying rent and they’ll get around to it when the landlord asks them, and this too is not “debt”, in fact at the start of the century it’s a narrative marker of cruelty for the landlord to insist on the rent being paid
Ok, those are my thoughts on credit vs debt as part of the shift from parochial economies to imperial market capitalism</Text>

            <Text>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.</Text>

            <Text>One potential chapter, for example, might examine Hannah More and William Wordsworth’s varying use of supernatural content and ballad forms as literary tools to “elevate” their readers. This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.</Text>

            <Title>ch 2 - archives</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.</Text>

            <Title>Sedgwick</Title>
            <Text>Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: “The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one’s findings: “What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.” The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. </Text>

p.559: n analysis of the most performed plays of the decade reveals that audiences enjoyed complicated plots, comic resolutions, traditional scenes of young love winning out over all odds. This is especially true of the theater up to the Terror; "patriotic entertainments" abound under the Terror, perhaps because so many other plays are prohibited or severely censured. After the Terror, for the last five years of the decade, the notion of good and bad revolutions is born, the Terror being in the latter category and seen as an aberration. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018

p.561:  Racine's position in sixty-first place, with only 298 performances, corroborates the public's preference for comedy over tragedy; and "approved" playwrights of the Revolution also fare poorly: Marie-Joseph Chénier comes in sixty-ninth place, with a total of only 283 performances (sixty two of them for Charles IX), while Jean-Louis Laya's four plays had a mere sixty performances, of which L'Ami des Lois had only eighteen. It is clear that these authors would be even less discussed if earlier critics had had access to the kind of information contained in these pages. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561: very useful and thought-provoking charts showing the top ten plays by year -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561: A book like this can correct many misconceptions that we have of the theater in Paris during the Revolutionary era; it can lead us to understand more clearly than ever before what people actually wanted to see, and permit us to make reasonable conjectures about why.

            <Text>Frow, John. Genre. New York: Routledge, 2015. Print.
John Frow articulates genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.</Text>

In Bannet’s book the importance of the French Revolution itself is actually minimised, when compared, that is, with the behavioural and attitudinal changes slowly fomented by British women writers across the eighteenth century. But, Bannet argues, the British reactions to the French Revolution nevertheless remain crucial in shaping and re-shaping ideas of domesticity.

            <Text>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.</Text>

If poetry was linked to other cultural forms in this struggle over the war in the decade that followed the French Revolution, it was also a form for which special claims were made, often presented in gendered terms. Poetry's links with ‘fancy,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘feeling’ were seen to make it crucial for representing the war and poets constantly called on these faculties as vital to their own representational strategies and to their readers' ability to respond to their visions of conflict. While poetry's feminised powers were frequently invoked, the wartime reconceptions and reformulations of poetry were often presented as a need for poetry to become more manly, a major factor in the remasculinisation of poetry in the romantic period.
Ch 2: This chapter discusses the poetic imaginings of war in the 1790s, particularly those of Charlotte Smith and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Smith's reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the 18th century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. In Fears in Solitude, Coleridge addresses a nation distant from the scene of conflict and ultimately offers his own imagining as a model for the nation. The imagining of war, then, plays a major role in the development of the romantic imagination.
Ch 3: This chapter discusses the war and poetic identity in the writings of Robert Southey and Wordsworth. In Southey's blank-verse poem, ‘History,’ he asks himself the repeated question ‘Was it for this…?’ This familiar narrative of an overwhelming sense of personal and political crisis producing a turn away from ‘History,’ often figured as here as a retreat to a bower, has been a major feature of accounts of canonical romanticism, and still holds considerable sway. Like Wordsworth's The Prelude, also begun in 1798 with the repeated question ‘Was it for this…?’, ‘History’ is a poem of poetic dedication at a time of historical crisis, but while history emerges only at the end of the two-book Prelude, in Southey's poem it is ‘History’ itself which offers the solution to the crisis.
Ch 4: This chapter discusses poetry, war, and gender in Wordsworth's political sonnets. Wordsworth's political sonnets of 1802-1803 were part of the huge outpouring of verse produced to unite, inspire, and animate the nation during the invasion scares if 1797-1798 and 1802-1805, the period that has been named ‘the Great Terror.’ This vast body of verse played an important role in the wartime forging of the British nation, both mediating the war to the British public and providing a means of patriotic expression. If poetry shaped understandings of the war in these years, the war in turn shaped poetry, limiting the kinds of writing that could be produced in such an atmosphere of national crisis. The chapter also details one example of poetic construction of the manly nation and its links to the remasculinisation of poetry, Wordworth's political sonnets.
Ch 5: This chapter discusses Walter Scott's picturesque romance of war. Scott was the bestselling and most popular poet of the Napoleonic wars and his metrical romances played a crucial role in mediating conflict to a nation at war. His phenomenally successful tales of ‘Border chivalry’ transformed the imagining of war, presenting it as heroic, shaped by the codes of romance, and framed by the conventions of the picturesque. Scott's poetry were about 16th-century wars but became popular during the Napoleonic wars. With his verse, the 18th-century emphasis on war's horrors gives way to the 19th-century stress on its glory. In addressing his readers as ‘Warriors’ in his last extended verse romance in 1814, Scott completed his remasculinisation of the reader and of poetry more generally contributing to the wartime revalidation of poetry as a manly pursuit for both writer and reader.
Ch 6: This chapter discusses the relationship of poetry and the Peninsular War. Robert Southey showed the extent to which the unfolding events in Spain has already been imagined, and written, as romance. Southey was not alone in responding to the war in the Peninsula as already shaped by the representations of ‘poets and romancers.’ The combination of geography and genre in the imaginative shaping of the latest stage of the war was compounded by the fashion for romance produced by the popularity of Walter Scott's poetry which coalesced with the sense of Spain as a land of romance to provide the major poetic framework for the British understanding of the war. The author also examines the poetic use of romance to shape and give meaning to the war, looking at the representational challenges this presented and at the poetic questioning and subversion of this generically inflected understanding of the conflict.
Ch 7: This chapter examines the works of Lord Byron and Felicia Hemans, whose obsession with war developed out of their engagement with the Peninsular War and whose poetic identities were profoundly shaped by their continued reflection on conflict. The chapter also focuses on one way in which these two writers represented war, the siege. They found in the siege a means of representing to their readership the entirety of modern war. The siege illustrates war's effects on the whole of society and it conflates within one site — the fortress, the citadel, or the walled city — the two spaces poetry frequently strives to link, the scene of conflict and the home. Both writers use the siege to explore the relations between war, gender, and history, exploiting the figure siege's rich allegorical and symbolic potential and ultimately find in it a figure for their own poetic identity.


Overall: This opening chapter, which will focus primarily on the writing of the 1790s, will begin by illustrating the role that poetry played in the effort to mobilize the country against France, and to resist that mobilization, But if poetry was linked to other cultural forms including song, theatre, and the visual arts in this struggle over the war in the decade that followed the French Revolution, it was also a form for which special claims were made, an area which will be examined in the second section of this chapter, poetry’s links with ‘fancy’, ‘imagination’, and ‘feeling’ were seen to make it crucial for representing the war and poets constantly called on these faculties as vital to their own representational strategies and to their readers’ ability to respond to their visions of conflict. As 1 will argue in the third section, the special claims made for poetry were often presented in gendered terms, While poetry’s feminized powers (and powers to feminize) were frequently invoked, the wartime reconceptions and refer, nidations of poetry were often presented as a need for poetry to become more manly, a major factor in the remasculinization of poetry in the romantic period. Finally, as an introduction to the major poetic (p.3) transformation in the imagining of war during the conflict, the fourth section will investigate some of the key tropes used to represent the war in the 1790s and the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott.</Text>

            <Title>notes from March 20 meeting</Title>
            <Text>All my terms (seriousness, timelessness, etc) are reasons a work might be canonized — clarifies my interests by ‘zooming out’ to the framework of the canon
What is the print landscape of the 1790s actually like? As opposed to our filtered versions via academics, subsequent generations of writers
TL Cowan etc - how do you actually do recuperative/reparative work on archives
Looking at digital corpora the way that people look at anthologies, classroom teaching, etc; talk about why it’s important to know this, becase this is what we all refer to now
Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)
Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. (But stay away from seeing Romanticism as starting here; I’d have to do a lot of work to justify to scholars the beginning of Romanticism in the 1790s)
Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about celebrity and reprinting into this chapter)
Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft &amp; Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strageically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?
A lot of my questions aren’t quite about canons, they’re about ARCHIVES, which are related but without the idea of cultural capital; do our archives just reflect our canons? — Marisett - how the dewey decimal system systematically excludes african american authors of the 20thC — data production (of course it’s really all capta — the things you choose, and also the things that are made available for capture; shaped by choices and by constraints)
Is it even possible to get back to that initial moment before the archive formation began? I’m going to try! Undoing the misperception of what we begin with “before” the archive, and the perception of what is produced by DH

Who was actually printing what? Booksellers and print culture from a DH angle

Gothic: synthesize popular and political? Radical novels are often Gothic; but Gothic is also highly popular/mainstream. Not just a simple fusion of mass and racial media, but something there? Gothic as a mode or material that people want to have an inherent political content, but in fact it can be used for any agenda, it can be used for various forms… but there’s a lot that can’t be reshaped? Repackages radical themes to be mass accessible (melodrama?)? — Re-read Gary Kelley’s Jacobin Novel; something on melodrama

TITLE:  (1790s English) Print Politics in the Digital Archive

Map of the thesis at this stage:
	1.	Introduction: archive formation!
	2.	Comparison of digital corpora (write this first)
	3.	Ok, now how can I use these corpora to ask again what the print landscape of the 1790s actually looked like?
	⁃	Mainstream press?
	⁃	Radical press? Is it actually surreptitious/marginal?
[Something something the Gothic? (Will develop as the earlier parts develop) — but don’t put this in the proposal set]
TODO: Slot all the bits that I don’t want to lose into this new structure

Ongoing warning: I’m not trying to talk to undergrads, so I don’t need to debunk undergrad misperceptions. Read more secondary literature. Email Terry for books more often!

Mention that I am writing my own code, and that I think it’s crucial to read code and critique its algorithmic assumptions. Very explicit about methods. 2015 NSF report on reproducibility of research. My methods have to be able to explain how they are trustworthy.
(Put datasets in open access — T-space? Cultural Analytics?)
(Can generate a lot of words on methods section — but don’t bury in appendices? Instead put it in methods sections? 10,000 words, not 40,000 words. Remember that Terry is the audience.)

To read: Alan Liu — read his work on Romantic canonization; try to meet him? Him and the editors of Romantic Circles are the godfathers of DH and Romanticism. Just had one in PMLA about disjunction between DH and literary critics, how we frame questions and results
Stephen Berhrendt? Editor of Romantic Circles?

            <Text>My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. The “major” works across the period develop from sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. I want to pose the same questions as the authors themselves: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor one’s feelings without being misled by them? In pursuit of this answer, my reading has led me to a subject matter, a methodology, and an affective stance.
I remain committed, for my subject matter, to the 1790s as an incredibly dense period of complex literary production shaped by what Robert Miles identifies as an apocalyptic political rupture.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change. For example, there is a narrative about a naive emotional philosophy in sentimental novels (benevolence), which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature. Perhaps, at its broadest level, this narrative is true or useful, but there are many more ways in which it is false.
One way which I seek to be more accurate is by paying close attention to what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. So, for example, I am interested in Burke’s Reflections as a text which is outcompeted by Williams when it is first published, and attracts a flood of negative responses, but which slowly outcompetes the others and becomes more successful over time as it gains credit for its prescience.
As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one.
My interest in the gothic is thus subsumed within my interest in 18thC strategies of feeling generally; gothic fear and supernatural imagination both represent strategies which are in conversation (and competition) with other strategies, which I also want to integrate.

            <Title>"good" and "bad" texts</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

            <Title>everyone wants conspiracy theories to be true</Title>
            <Text>Conspiracy theories play such a huge role in France! The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!
Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

            <Title>Romantic misfits</Title>
            <Text>“The first [group of ‘misfits’] was excluded from literary history in order to secure the status of those writers who did ‘fit’ (the ‘Romantics’) even as the Romantics themselves based their claim to high literary status on their status as misfits-- on their success in transcending the literary marketplace to which other writers were represented as in thrall (because fitting too well).” (5)

“there are recurring themes, such as the manner in which the ‘structural transformation of the public sphere’ during the Romantic era is itself an integral aspect of the story of how ‘high’ literature was constructed at the expense of the ‘low’ (where ‘public engagement’ becomes a defining feature of the ‘low’, and self-cultivation a quality of ‘high’).” (6) — nowadays we value public engagement; at the time, politics/ethics was publicly engaged…?

	•	“As I see the literary culture of the period, there is a dialectical play between the radical Enlightenment and its counter. But instead of seeing the period Balkanized into three generations, with the first and last favoring ‘enlightenment modes’ and the middle settling into ‘reaction’ (or ‘Counter-Enlightenment’), I detect a constant dialectical play between these two poles that were subjectivities as much as they were political positions and, as a consequence, also stubbornly resistant to rational argument. This dialectical play is driven less by the French Revolution and more by the historical rupture it was seen to constitute. … The sense of crisis induced by the first intimation of ‘global synchronicity’, linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later, and they differ dialectically.” (11)

            <Title>no longer considering scales as different models</Title>
            <Text>My initial thesis proposal proposed approaching my decade of interest by examining three different “models” of different levels of detail: “One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.”
I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.</Text>

            <Text>I am not sure what I now know about Charlotte Smith that I didn't before, but I feel like I know something. Mostly, I think, spreading all these poems out in my timeline helps to clarify that Elegiac Sonnets (like Tristram Shandy!) is not actually a single unified work representing one moment of time, but rather an assemblage that can react to the events it shapes. The re-introduction of chronological gaps makes it easier to identify where she is developing her thoughts or changing her mind, and highlights the trial-and-error of her experiments as sets of poems are entered into the record.</Text>

            <Text>A particularly interesting text which might reward a study of both its timeliness and its use of feeling is Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, which was first published in 1766 but continued to be frequently reprinted in the 1790s. The persistence of Wakefield immediately undermines any literary history which wholly relegates the sentimental novel to the 1760s and 1770s. However, by the 1790s Wakefield is no longer competing with The Man of Feeling (which many of its former dedicated readers now regarded with embarassment), and instead was read alongside the contemporary literature of sensibility in the Gothic mode. There is much still to be uncovered about how readers in the 1790s made very different sense of this work’s political and religious sermons, dramatic and moving prison scenes, and moralizing love-plot.</Text>

There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness.

            <Title>model 1: ESTC</Title>
            <Text>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 
I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.</Text>

            <Title>OGS Plan of Study 2017</Title>
            <Text>A recent article by Bode exemplifies a current shift in approaches to digitally-enhanced literary scholarship. Bode builds a critique of “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as complete and objective, Bode argues, it is not different from New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.

I have narrowed my scope to an eleven-year “decade,” keyed to the French Revolution, to make my inquiry feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 works published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.

To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading and corpus stylistics, but I will marry these to bibliographic textual studies and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired bibliographic records for 51,965 works listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewhere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, enabling more detailed computational exploration of their subject matter. 

I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically and influentially during the 1790s, but are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon.

The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and will recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.</Text>

            <Title>McCarty: interdisciplinary</Title>
            <Text>Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that “[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation”: the current state of “digital humanities” research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to “hard sciences.” The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables — an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti — is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,” it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy — a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

http://doctornerdington.tumblr.com/post/161275412738/if-we-cannot-locate-aesthetic-value-of-texts-in
In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.
What do you think?
(via fanhackers)
“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!
I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.
Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

            <Title>18thC feeling</Title>
            <Text>Reading Feeling
My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional response, is this a healthy form of exercise for its audience’s moral feeling, or a weakening distraction from real moral action? These questions, in translated form, continue to shape my own questions about literature as a field: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor the importance of feeling without being misled by emotional manipulation?
The “major” works across the period are characterized by sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. My interest in the gothic and the supernatural is thus subsumed within a larger conversation about the representation of feeling. As Clery, Miles, and Gamer have explored in different ways, gothic and supernatural stories encompass a subset of literary strategies to understand and use feeling, which exist in conversation and competition with other strategies. Each work must strike its own balance between exciting the feelings of its readers, and moderating them. The simplest narrative tracing this development begins with a naive emotional philosophy of benevolence in sentimental novels, which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature.</Text>

            <Title>research methods for corpora comparisons</Title>
            <Text>My biggest-scale question is: I have all of these different corpora of stuff from 1789-99. How can I compare what they contain? If people only worked with the absolute easiest corpus to access (ECCO-TCP), what would they be leaving out?

I want to develop a consistent ontology (in the computer science definition of the word) to apply to all of the corpora, so I can directly compare what kinds of materials each includes. It's important for this ontology to be able to tell me things like "this corpus consists entirely of plays" (because one of them definitely does) but I don't know how to know in advance what categories I'll need. (I'm going to ask my mom about this, ontologies are her jam.)

Then I want to look at each individual corpus and classify its contents into my ontology categories. I'll probably do this computationally also, but it's important to me to classify at least some of each corpus by hand, to check (or train?) my computational approach. Since I can't classify 52,000 things by hand (1 minute per thing = 866 hours) I want to take a random sample, classify *that*, and say "the whole thing probably looks roughly like this." I'll probably be classifying just by title / title page so they should all be able to "respond," but if I want to look at how well those titles reflect the actual content I might start bumping up against works that I can't access (and also I'll want to use smaller samples so I can spend longer on each item.)

I'd like to use the smallest sample that is still acceptably trustworthy. I don't know what is considered acceptably trustworthy: 70%? 98%?

I have several corpora -- smallest one 466 items, biggest one 52,000 -- so I am looking for a calculation to run each time I decide to sample a new corpus. (My first instinct was to pick one number and sample that many of each one, but on reflection, that's... not right, is it? Should I sample the same *percentage* of each one?)

I'm basically treating each corpus as a non-random sample of the platonic ideal of "Printed Works In Britain 1789-99" and trying to see how each corpus represents that platonic ideal, and also trying to inch closer to that platonic ideal.</Text>

Should I foreground "preposession" further, and its relationship to the political philosophy of the day?

            <Text>My introduction will define the terms and concepts which the rest of the dissertation will use, paying particular attention to the parallel development of similar concerns in DH and non-DH fields. I will explicitly note that my DH methods align me with scholars in queer DH, and discuss some of the underlying assumptions of queer theory which shape my thinking: my aspiration is a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. The introduction will also address why I define my window of interest as 1789-99, and who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.
Vocabulary to be discussed:
	•	“Surface” reading vs “distant” reading (and, of course, their ties to close reading)
	•	Popularity, canon, marginalization
	•	My preferred DH terminology around modelling, sensitivity, and fruitfulness
The introduction will thus allow me to to deal directly with the way that other researchers in my fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address my questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading.

            <Text>My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair’s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer’s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the “parade of authors” and “parliament of texts” models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the “footprint” left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski’s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “resonance,” which takes Brewer’s “footprint” as the primary object of study to trace the “busy afterlife of the literary artifact” which “refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.” This “busy afterlife” can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work’s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. </Text>

            <Title>Murphy, Peter</Title>
            <Text>Abstract: “Peter Murphy’s book examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history, or poetry as an art. It focuses on five writers in the Romantic period: James MacPherson, Robert Burns, James Hogg, Walter Scott, and William Wordsworth. The first four are Scottish; the economic and linguistic status of Scotland during the period makes its writers especially interesting as examples of poetic ambition. Murphy’s study then crosses the border into England, offering a new perspective on Wordsworth’s poetic ambition and career. Murphy’s engagement throughout with the ballad revival fields fresh insights into some major concerns of the Romantic period: the interest in the primitive and the simple, experiments with poetic form, the problematics of loss, and the emergence of a new literary culture.” (Page i)

Introduction
“The fact that critics want to talk about Wordsworth more than they do MacPherson is a fact, and in what follows I try to deal with that fact.” (2)
“I try to specify the forces that work to produce the poetry that these writers write, and the forces that cause them to choose poetry writing as a job in the first place.” (3)
“That they choose poetry as a means of escaping into the world of higher life puts poetry in a most material and homely setting. Most of the poetry in these careers has the plainest of material purposes, and much the same status as any other thinga person might make and sell for a hopeful profit. By delineating with particularity the sorts of pressure that result in poetry in these lives, I hope to return poetry to the plain and everyday world of human motive and need, and in this sense this book is deeply historicist.” (3)
Burns couldn’t originally mix among the decorous classes. “Society is ruled by form, and poetry is too… Poetic propriety and ‘social’ propriety mix and become indistinguishable. For the ambitious, a poetic ‘mistake’ has exactly the same consequences as / a social mistake: the threat of failure, rejection by the world that the ambitious writer wishes to enter.” (3-4)
Evaluates people based on how much they exploit the oral northernness they sell - MacPherson the worst, Wordsworth and Scott both have integrity (4-5)
“In what follows I do not wish to recreate the poetic haven that Brooks gives us, but I try to acknowledge at all times that some poets are more capable than others, and that this fact must exert an important evaluation of the place and identity of poetry. To revocalize Brooks in a new key: if it is worth talking about poetry as a distinct form of culture, then we must talk about poetic success and failure. … If poetry as poetry exists in any meaningful form for us, we must find a way to tak about what makes poetry different from other forms of writing: we must talk about the life and energy of poetic form.” (7)

Chapter 1: James MacPherson
“MacPherson was once famous; he has now lapsed, and when we turn to him we must first raise him from oblivion. …quite probably he would not have cared about the lapse of his literary reputation. He died a famous and influential man, and, during much of his life, his primary activities and interests were not literary.” (9)
P. 31 - marketing of Ossian. “MacPherson can compliment Ossian’s poems so extravagantly because he claims to be merely a translator… The money, currency, accrues to MacPherson; the golden intregrity is added to Ossian’s account.” But I don’t see much discussion of how much money or from whom
“MacPherson was one of the greatest of Highland exporters, and the Ossian poems drew more attention to the Highlands than anything else, the rebellion of 1745 excepted” (36) — substantiated by a spike in tourism
“What sort of poetry is this, and what sort of poetic status can we give to James MacPherson? … The controversy and the curiously opaque fraud of the poems work in MacPherson’s favor, since he wants notice above all. He can’t lose: I have tried to show who does lose, but MacPherson cannot. His ambition is fulfilled with ruthless freedom, and as long as he is free he will simply ride the wind of the storm he raises. I would insist that his canonical death is justified, though, because he has committed a literary crime. He is a brilliant but utterly unpoetic poet. His contempt for form is a contempt for / real literary beauty, an the divine emptiness of Ossian’s poems is the result. He is a calculator, a poet for whom poetry is quite simply a possible road to success, and so he happily leaves literature behind… Especially after the reworked inspiration that the high romantic poets give to us, MacPherson’s motives, and what they produce, look appalling. I think we should insist on the ugliness of MacPherson’s poetry, but not on the ugliness of his motives. Such motives have produced more poetry than we often admit. Ambition is a human passion and partakes of human complexity. … Burns’ ambition matches that of MacPherson, and he creates a career for himself  in a very similar way, by retailing simplicity to the jaded sophisticate. But Burns was a poet, and he could not blind himself to the consequences of form. This sensitivity derails his career, and he dies romantically young and destitute; but he wrote some beautiful things.” (48)

I HATE THIS. Despite the rhetoric of being realistic and understanding about poetry as an occupation, it’s constantly drawing equivalences between commerciality and quality, and reinforcing the myth of the uncommercial beautiful genius.

Chapter 5: William Wordsworth
“Like Scott (and my other writers), Wordsworth was also profoundly interested in his readers, and profoundly interested in being a popular author. Wordsworth thought much more about success and failure than we tend to remember, and even though recen writing has taken / some notice of his interest in his readers we still remember the ‘fit audience’ of 1815 better than the anxously solicitous Wordsworth of the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads. Unlike Scott, though, Wordsworth’s methods resist popularity: he is constantly scolding and working on his reader, emphasizing moments of discomfort rather than passing them by.” (182-3)
“Poetic integrity does not, however, protect Wordsworth from becoming painfully frustrated by his lack of influence over his readers, as measured by their resistance to purchasing his books. Wordsworth wants to sell books: he wants people to read his books, be changed, and make him famous.” (183)
“For me and for Wordsworth, the proof is in the poetry” (187)
“‘Peter Bell’ s not a bad poem; it is a funny, wry poem, and a sincere poem too; it has more of the zany energies of the lyrics of 1798 than the staid proprieties of its published date, 1819. It is, however, a failed poem: it cannot fulfill its impossible desire of including the whole poetic world inside itself. It fails at the limits of poetry.” (194) It’s also an infamous commercial flop!!!
WW’s 1815 essay is the peak and the end of his obsession w popularity — expresses frustration, then formulates protective argument that greatness is unpopular (194-5). “There is a desperation about the whole argument, and no wonder, since one of its tasks is to prove Shakespeare unpopular.” (195)

Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft &amp; Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these texts? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Authors choosing publishers strategically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?

            <Text>My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being “unserious” (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about “redeeming literary value” in the Gothic.</Text>

* There is clear signposting and linking between paragraphs, sections, and chapters. It consistently (but not repetitively) reminds the reader of the purpose, argument, or overall thrust of the thesis. 
* The literature review is critical and evaluative, and sets forth an argument for why and how the study should be conducted. 
* The discussion of the rationale for selecting a methodology and method (including up-to-date methodological literature) is balanced. The ground-setting is sophisticated and appropriate (including exposition of underlying assumptions, and relevance to the research aim). 
* The research design is appropriate and allows the questions to be answered. 
* There is a meticulous account of the procedure. 
* A rich variety of evidence is employed to develop a balanced argument. 
* Advanced analytical skills are used to demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem; a clear chain of evidence is laid down. 
* The discussion is disciplined and not excessively speculative. 
* Conclusions are well drawn and convincing (they relate the outcomes back to the research aims); clear and strong knowledge claims are made about the exact contributions of the thesis. 
* Key concepts or variables are clearly defined and consistently used throughout. 
* Written expression is elegant, precise, and economical.

            <Title>ch 3 - lingering legacies</Title>
            <Text>Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? As in my first chapter, the “case study” texts for this chapter will emerge from my broader research. I am particularly eager to investigate timely re-stagings of plays, given the heightened ephemerality and thus timeliness of theatrical productions compared to print; my first step is to assemble a precise timeline of what was staged during the period. For printed works, some initial exploration suggests that Shakespeare, Oliver Goldsmith, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Johnson, or Milton might be of interest. I will need to determine what distinction, if any, I might want to draw between “canonical” authors like Shakespeare and Milton, whose posthumous prominence is predictable, and any shorter-lived targeted reprintings that I might discover. This chapter, then, is another way of engaging with the idea of “legacy,” exploring the distinctions between “timelessness” and “lasting timeliness.”</Text>

            <Title>long history of using songs to be popular</Title>
            <Text>I've been thinking a lot about songs. As far as I can tell, in the 1820s, poets have been boldly revitalizing poetry by publishing edited versions of popular songs for at least fifty years.

The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects. But, seeing Wordsworth and Coleridge as participants in a literary conversation also makes them more interesting again, so I can forgive them their propaganda and just focus on how interesting it is that Wordsworth's 1798 "The Thorn" has so much in common with Hannah More's 1796 "Ballad of Robert and Richard" (both of them are trying to 'elevate' ghost stories above vulgar superstition, for the improvement of their audiences, but with completely different ideas as to what that entails).

The second part of "thinking a lot about songs" involves a leap of several hundred years: Jo Walton is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning writer, and she says that "the single most quoted thing I have ever written" is... a limerick she posted in a usenet newsgroup in 1998, "The Lurkers Support Me In Email," to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean.” I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find that Hannah More has also written a morally-improving ballad to that tune (or, if she hasn't, it's only because the song is too associated with Jacobins), and certainly her other songs all mention specific tunes which she assumes I will already know.

So there's something interesting to me, here, about the idea of layering your words over top of pattern someone else already knows, as a way to get your version to stick more easily in people's heads. I don't think Jo Walton was intentionally trying to write something extremely memorable, but Hannah More certainly was.</Text>

            <Title>Joseph Ritson's Robin Hood</Title>
            <Text>Me: @jesslockhart, the thing about my dissertation is this person Joseph Ritson whom I have INEXPLICABLY never heard of despite reading a bunch of books about 18thC ballads, Jacobin politics in poetry, etc etc etc. He seems like a REALLY interesting guy, RIGHT in my decade, and possibly a good candidate for some recovery work
Me: looks like ECCO doesn’t have his 1795 Robin Hood! 1789-99, all I have attributed to him are 3 critiques of somebody’s edition of Shakespeare, 1 critique of History of English Poetry, and 1 work titled “law-tracts”.
Cai: He's the guy who wrote The Robin Hood Collection, and he added the "give to the poor" bit because he was a Jacobin
Me: ESTC has 1 volume of shakespeare criticism and 4 of legal stuff attributed to him
Cai: Robin Hood before this shows up in lots of places as a stock character or in this story or another, but Joseph Ritson is apparently the guy who, having put almost all the circulating Robin tales into one volume, hands down to future writers/readers The Robin Hood and also a set of "outlaw stock tropes"
so if you're writing Outlaw Tales after 1795, you're indebted to Ritson (so we have found according to wikipedia anyway)

lawrence [9:33 PM]
31 ESTC titles mention Robin Hood, many unattributed, so Ritson must be hiding in there (edited)

cemhend [9:33 PM]
I wonder if he didn't credit himself as author but as compiler so that keeps him out of those dbs @lawrence? not sure how they work

lawrence [9:34 PM]
the specific MARC label I checked generally includes identified-by-scholarship relevant “persons” (as opposed to necessarily the author credited)
but if nobody bothered to go and encode that he’s the unsigned author it’s easy for him to get left out

jesslockhart [8:23 PM]
“In nearly all the small points with which he dealt, Ritson was in the right, and his corrections have since been adopted, but the unjustly bitter language of his criticisms roused great anger at the time, much, it would appear, to Ritson’s delight.”
Wiki indicates that Joseph Ritson was a shit disturber

            <Text>(1a) I am excited about the ways that distant reading allows the consideration of more works, and thus an expansion of the works under discussion.  I’ll probably make a database trying to combine all the stuff I have, and definitely make a lot of artisanal hand-crafted “small data.
(1b) I am also excited about the recursive reflective process of modelling: the usefulness of making one’s models and their parameters explicit and testing multiple models; the need to actually meaningfully *account for* the full variety of what one is working with, to grapple with and reconcile outliers.”
My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline.
Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all” (McCarty). These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.
“The range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation.” … “Between these two is what seems to me the ideal – a combination, not compromise, of centrifugal freedom and centripetal beholdenness.” (McCarty) 
“digital humanities offers a middle ground or conjectural space within which, data being simply data, the objects of study dear to the humanities may be treated temporarily as if they were objects of nature, like rocks or stars, then the results of that treatment juxtaposed to how we see them and questions asked.” (McCarty)</Text>

            <Text>“THE POPULARITY OF ENGLISH RENAISSANCE PRINTED PLAYS declined dramatically in 1997. For most of the twentieth century, scholars had asserted that plays were a successful portion of the book trade, yielding a predictable profit for publishers.” (1)
“Since 1997, however, Shakespeareans have tended to argue a position just the opposite of this received wisdom. Printed plays, it is now maintained, were “risky business ventures” in which publishers, who “in most cases had little or nothing to gain from playbooks,” were “understandably reluctant” to invest.” (1)

“This shift in scholarly thinking can be dated to Peter W. M. Blayney’s landmark article,“The Publication of Playbooks,” cited by all of the authors quoted above” (2)

“He argues instead that new plays“never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books,” comprising between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent of the entries in the ShortTitle Catalogue from 1583 to 1642.” (3)
“From 1583 to 1602, “only” 48 percent of first editions were reprinted within twenty-five years; from 1603 to 1622, the figure is just over 50 percent; from 1623 to 1642, less than 29 percent.17 “Fewer than 21 percent of the plays published in the sixty years under discussion reached a second edition inside nine years”; this / means, he argues, that “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years.” (3-4)

“Whereas much early-twentieth-century bibliographic scholarship was impressionistic and based on a priori assumptions about the popularity of printed drama, Blayney provides a detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays as evidence against the “myth” of the popularity of playbooks. But, like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books.” (4)

“popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (4)

“Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends. While the myth of piracy is false, the “myth” of playbook popularity happens to be true.” (4)
“Blayney judges best-sellers by total number of editions within twenty-five years of first publication” (4)
“as we will argue, the ShortTitle Catalogue (STC) in its entirety is far too broad to serve this function” (4)

“The criterion that brings us closest to consumer demand is the rate of reprinting of playbooks, since a publisher’s decision to reprint can usually be assumed to indicate both that the previous edition had sold out (or was about to sell out) and that the publisher anticipated continued demand for the book.” (5)
“Admittedly, reprint rates tell us neither the number of individual copies bought and sold nor the total capital invested in or profits earned from the sale of plays” (5)
“We can, though, estimate profitability, as we do later in the essay, by using sheet lengths as a gauge for comparing the likely profits of a typical playbook with those of other kinds of books. Used in conjunction with profitability estimates, market share, and total editions, reprint rates can provide our best indication of the kind of popularity in which most of us are interested—the popularity of books with customers.” (6)

“Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest. They turned a profit more reliably than most other types of books, and this profit would not have been paltry” (6)

“Figures 1 and 2 show that the trends in the publication of printed professional plays divide that market into six distinct periods:” (7)
1576–1597: an initial period of low production (48 first editions, 11 second-plus editions) 
1598–1613: a boom followed by sustained high production (129 first editions, 79 second-plus editions) 
1614–1628: a gradual contraction, with production levels generally still above those of 1576–1597 (31 first editions, 65 second-plus editions) 
1629–1640: a second boom (122 first editions, 84 second-plus editions) 1641–1649: a sharp contraction, with only one play published from 1643 to 1645 
(17 first editions, 10 second-plus editions) 1650–1660: an expansion to levels slightly above those of 1614–1628 (58 first editions, 27 second-plus editions) 
“as figure 1 indicates, this first extended boom was initially driven by a rapid increase in second editions, not new plays” (10)
“Further, more and more stationers started entering the market for printed professional drama. From 1600 to 1602, 71 percent of first editions were produced by stationers who had never previously published a single play. Before then, play publication had been concentrated among relatively few stationers, with stationers new to professional drama bringing out only 20 percent of the first editions printed from 1595 to 1597, and only 36 percent of those printed from 1598 to 1599. The boom thus resulted in a widening, not merely a deepening, of stationer interest in playbooks.” (10)

“The ensuing period of market contraction for printed plays underscores the relative independence of print from the stage.” (11)
“this steep decline is accounted for almost entirely by a plunge in first editions from 8.1 to 2.1 per year. Indeed, according to the extant archive, from 1626 to 1628 not a single new professional play reached print, the first time such a suspension of play publication had occurred since 1588. The publication of second-plus editions, by contrast, hardly changed at all, decreasing only slightly from 4.9 to 4.3 editions per year.” (12)
“Some combination of changes in both supply and demand probably underlies the contraction, but what both hypotheses reveal is the centrality of reprints to the market for printed drama.” (12)

“When we include second-plus editions, Shakespeare’s plays occupy an even larger share of the overall market (twenty-three of eighty playbooks, or 29 percent). Shakespeare’s closest competitors during this seven-year period lag far behind: Robert Greene (nine playbooks) and Christopher Marlowe (five playbooks). We should point out, however, that Shakespeare was named on only nine of these title pages, which is hardly surprising given that authors in general appeared on only 36 percent of all play title pages during this period.” (11)

“second-plus editions were an extremely safe investment, for they almost always sold well enough to be printed in yet another edition; from 1576 to 1625, a whopping 72 percent of second-plus editions were reprinted within twenty years” (12)
“Reprints, which were surely less dependent on theatrical popularity than first editions, formed the backbone of the trade in printed plays.” (13)

“However much the Jonson and Shakespeare folios may have elevated the cultural value of drama, they seem to have had little or no effect on its economic value. Instead, what created that economic value and finally established the market for printed drama was not these imposing folios but rather the more humble quarto reprints from the end of the 1590s.” (13)

“Once the market for printed professional plays had been created, just how significant was it? Blayney estimates that new plays accounted for 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent of all entries in the STC from 1583 to 1642.35 We would argue that these figures do not properly reflect the significance of playbooks in the book trade.” (13)
“by setting the number of plays against the total number of entries in the STC, Blayney’s figures compare apples and oranges. Although the STC presents the best picture we have of the mass of printed material circulating in early modern England, a fair number of entries, as Blayney himself notes, do not represent separate editions at all but are instead merely variant issues or states of a single edition.” (13)
“Blayney deals with playtexts, not playbooks, and so includes twenty-nine plays published only in collection and not as separate books.” (13)

“While all playbooks were “speculative,” meaning that publishers decided to invest in them based on their assessment of potential consumer demand, not all books carried this element of risk. When stationers produced state proclamations, visitation articles, or university act verses and theses—to take just a few frequent examples—they were not making decisions about the commercial viability of these items; rather, they were paid in advance and printed them on command.” (14)
“this question of speculation is crucial if we want to use market share to assess popularity” (14)
“we produced a sample of the STC from 1590 to 1640 by selecting six discrete years (1590, 1600, 1610, 1620, 1630, 1635) and examining every entry listed for those years, excluding variant issues and non-speculative books of the kinds discussed above” (14)
“79 percent are for speculative publications” (14)

“As the lower line on figure 3 shows, printed plays constituted a much larger market share than previously thought; indeed, in periods of expansion, that share was three times larger than Blayney’s figures show.” (14)
“in their peak years, professional plays made up 6.2 percent of the overall speculative market, or one in every sixteen speculative editions. While certainly not the dominant segment, playbooks were hardly marginal” (16)
“Figure 3 also confirms that changes in the market for plays were not simply responses to changes in the book trade as a whole; rather, the expansions and contractions in the total number of printed plays were also expansions and contractions in their market share” (16)

“these figures do not tell us the proportion of individual copies of printed plays among copies of all books, since we lack evidence for the press runs of most editions. Nor do they tell us the total capital invested in and revenue generated by playbooks compared to other classes of books.” (16)
“Without this evidence, we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books in early modern England, if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists or a publishing firm’s “bottom line.”” (16)

“It is nonetheless obvious that, in terms both of total copies sold and of total investment and profits, the dominant force in the early modern speculative book trade was a select group of titles protected by royal patents or by the English Stock monopoly. These include almanacs, Bibles, catechisms, and school books.” (16)
“While patented and monopolistic books comprise only about 11 percent of the total entries in our STC sample, that figure understates their importance, for not only were these books produced in greater press runs, but some, such as almanacs and primers, have higher loss rates as well.” (17)
“patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (17)
“Isolating the market for non-monopolistic books thus tells us more about stationers’ evaluations of uncertain demand than does an analysis that lumps together risky non-monopolistic books with constantly reprinted monopolistic titles.” (17)

“If we want to understand not which books were the most important financially to the book trade as a whole but rather how attractive playbooks were as investments, then we need to determine how often stationers chose to publish plays rather than other kinds of books available to them.” (17)

“Whether these figures seem high or low is to some degree a subjective measure. Both the “maximal” and the “minimal” market shares presented in figure 3 certainly suggest that playbooks were much more prevalent than recent scholarship has supposed, but whether they demonstrate the popularity of playbooks is a determination that can be made only after further studies produce the corresponding figures for other classes of books (poetry, travel, or medicine, for instance).” (18)
“we will compare playbooks to printed sermons, but without more such analyses, it is not possible to establish clearly the relative popularity of playbooks in terms of market share. What is certain, however, is that printed plays sold very well indeed compared to other kinds of books” (18)

“The problem, then, is not with these figures per se but with the fact that, because popularity is a relative concept, one cannot determine whether Blayney’s data indicate the relative unpopularity of playbooks (as he claims) or the relative popularity of playbooks, unless one knows how they compare to the reprint rates of other books.” (18)
“they were reprinted at more than twice the rate of speculative books in general (39.9 percent versus 18.1 percent)” (18)
“And these reprints were themselves extremely popular, with almost three-quarters of all second-plus editions reaching a further edition.” (20)
“Playbooks compare very well not only to a representative sample of all speculative books but also to the entire extant archive of one class of books, sermons in English, often considered one of the more successful segments of the early modern book trade” (21)

“judging by market share, sermons do indeed appear to have been more popular than playbooks” (21)
“During the period of their highest production (1606–1640), printed sermons averaged just over forty-two editions per year, comprising 9.8 percent of the speculative market (or 11.4 percent of the non-monopolistic speculative market), more than twice the market share of professional plays during their two highest periods.” (21)
“But if we assess sermons by reprint rates, their relative popularity begins to dim: 19.3 percent of sermons first printed from 1576 to 1625 were reprinted inside twenty years, almost exactly the rate for speculative books in general. Even during the period of their peak reprint rates—29.9 percent from 1591 to 1606—sermons were reprinted much less frequently than were professional plays.” (21)
“Figure 5 shows the percentage of all professional plays and sermons first printed from 1576 to 1625 that reached two editions, three editions, and so on through ten or more editions by 1660. At each level, playbooks outperform sermons” (22)
“In fact, playbooks were more likely to reach a third edition by 1660 (26.1 percent) than the average English sermon was to reach a second (20 percent).” (22)
“Therefore, unless the combined press runs of a play’s first two editions were regularly smaller than the press run of the first edition of a sermon (and this seems highly improbable), then the typical playbook must have sold more total individual copies than the typical sermon.” (22)

“Playbooks outperformed sermons partly because plays were, in one important sense, less ephemeral than sermons. If a sermon was not reprinted within five years of its initial publication, it was highly unlikely ever to be reprinted.” (22)
“playbooks were just as likely to be first reprinted after five years as within five years” (22)
“Plays not only repaid their publishers’ investments more quickly than other books, but they also remained profitable far longer.” (24)

“The reprint success of playbooks, however, may give rise to the question of why more weren’t published if they were such a good investment for stationers.” (24)
“an average of just under six per year—has nevertheless seemed quite a low number to most recent scholars” (24)

[Is it because they are too short to be able to turn enough profit to be worthwhile? no]
“The median (rather than the average) length of these 987 titles was only ten-and-ahalf sheets” (25)
“Because playbooks were fairly typical in length—and therefore in price and potential profits—and, at the same time, were far more likely to sell out than other books, many publishers must have found them attractive investments. In contrast to the low-cost, low-profit, higher-risk publications that recent scholarship has taken them to be, playbooks were in fact middling-cost, middling-profit, lower-risk publications—an appealing profile for speculators.” (25)

“If the seeming paucity of playbooks cannot be attributed to low demand— either from consumers (judging by reprint rates) or from stationers (judging by their profit profile)—then perhaps we should investigate supply.” (25)
“early modern playing companies made their decisions based on their own economic interests, not on the interests of stationers” (26)
“Perhaps stationers would have published more plays had they been as plentiful as other texts.” (26)

“Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (26)
“Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”?” (27)
“For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (27)

“we turn briefly to the Caroline period, when the trade in playbooks, which had long functioned according to one structure of popularity, now fissured into two” (27)
“We are thus left with a seeming contradiction: if judged by reprint rates, plays seem to have become less popular in the Caroline period, yet according to two other indices of popularity—editions per year and market share—plays were at least as popular as ever.” (27)
“Reprint rates seem to have been depressed because of an unprecedented division between the structures of popularity for first and second-plus editions.” (27)
“in the Caroline period new plays were almost never reprinted, while second-plus editions continued to be reprinted at roughly the same rate” (28)
“The market for first editions was dominated by one group of publishers, and that for second-plus editions by a different group of publishers, with very little overlap” (28)
“The market for first editions seems to have been driven by customers’ desire for novelty, for the newest playbook in the stationer’s shop from the latest play performed in the theater” (28)
“The market for second-plus editions, on the other hand, depended on customers’ attachment to particular “classics,”” (28)

Methods
“STC Sample: We cannot assume that the “speculative rate” for our six-year STC sample (79 percent) automatically matches that for the entire fifty-one-year period of 1590 through 1640, so we must therefore acknowledge the potential margin of error, which in this case is ±1.4 percent.” (30)
“We have chosen for our STC sample six years—1590, 1600, 1610, 1620, 1630, and 1635—that, due to STC cataloguing practices, contain a higher than average number of entries with inferred dates” … “For these purposes, statistical tests demonstrate that entries with inferred dates are not inconsistent with all other entries in these years.” (30)

“Reprint Parameters:” “First, Blayney uses a twenty-five-year window for reprints, while we use a more conservative twenty-year window” “Second, he designates the year of publication as Year 1, while we count it as Year 0” “he has also included several university plays that we have not” “Blayney tracks plays first printed in collections separately from the collection as a whole” (31)
“whereas we are interested in reprints of playbooks, not playtexts, and so consider F2 as a single book and a single reprint of F1”
“Applying our parameters to the periods analyzed by Blayney but extending our reprint window to twenty-five years to match his yields reprint rates of 42.7 percent (thirty-eight of eighty-nine) for 1583–1602, 43.1 percent (forty-seven of 109) for 1603–22, and 15.6 percent (twenty-one of 135) for 1623–42. Since Blayney’s figures turn out to be higher than ours, our argument about the popularity of playbooks remains unaffected.”

“Sermon Archive: Our sermon archive includes all known editions of sermons in English first printed from 1576 to 1640. We compiled this archive by searching in the STC and ESTC, and by consulting the following works”

            <Text>My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.
I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” </Text>

What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.
A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.</Text>

On publishing statistics, DFM is very incisive about the difference between production rates and survival rates, and the tendency of scholars to talk about the first when really the only thing they see is the second. This isn't going to be such a big issue for the 1790s, but it's going to be an issue all the same. He's good on sheet counts and print runs too: the way a fugitive one-sheet broadside in two tiny editions can show up bibliometrically (in an ESTC count, say) as a bigger deal than, or more "popular" than, a fat heavyweight folio in a single edition with a big print run. </Text>

            <Text>Reading Feeling, Writing Timeliness:
Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature
To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two contentious elements of literature, the complex and variable interrelationship of which my study foregrounds, are feeling and timeliness. Both concepts shape eighteenth century writing, and my approach to it. “Feeling” as a central idea refers both to the literature of sensibility as an evolving counterpoint to enlightenment rationalism, and to contemporary processes of reparative reading which foreground the limits of scholarly critique. “Timeliness” encompasses both the urgent responses of the eighteenth century mediascape to a perceived historical rupture, and to an exhaustively particular methodology of historicized textual study. Although my project remains quantitative and computational in its technological foundations, my central interest remains with the field of eighteenth century studies, rather than the field of the digital humanities.</Text>

(What about, e.g., Percy editing Frankenstein? Other manuscript works were surely revised in response to feedback, but Mary giving Percy a copy doesn’t feel like “publication”.)
Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren’t likely to be fully useful. I like first publication to reflect when the work became less inchoate and entered into a broader literary conversation — this is the point at which chronological connections seem most likely to be informative.</Text>

            <Text>On the Grasshopper and Cricket

The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead
In summer luxury,--he has never done
With his delights; for when tired out with fun
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
On a lone winter evening, when the frost
Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

The above sonnet was written in competition with Leigh Hunt.

            <Text>What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.
I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.</Text>

Memoralizing, too, is cyclical: “And now, where Caesar saw with proud disdain / The wattled hut and skin of azure stain, / Corinthian columns rear their graceful forms, / And light varandas brave the wintry storms, / While British tongues the fading fame prolong / Of Tully's eloquence and Maro's song.”

Perhaps, she says, long ages past away, 
And set in western waves our closing day, {120} 
Night, Gothic night, again may shade the plains 
Where Power is seated, and where Science reigns; 
England, the seat of arts, be only known 
By the gray ruin and the mouldering stone; 
That Time may tear the garland from her brow, {125} 
And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now. 
   Yet then the ingenuous youth whom Fancy fires 
With pictured glories of illustrious sires, 
With duteous zeal their pilgrimage shall take 
From the blue mountains, or Ontario's lake, {130} 
With fond adoring steps to press the sod 
By statesmen, sages, poets, heroes trod

…

  But who their mingled feelings shall pursue 
When London's faded glories rise to view? 
The mighty city, which by every road, 
In floods of people poured itself abroad; {160} 
Ungirt by walls, irregularly great, 
No jealous drawbridge, and no closing gate; 
Whose merchants (such the state which commerce brings) 
Sent forth their mandates to dependant kings; 
Streets, where the turban'd Moslem, bearded Jew, {165} 
And woolly Afric, met the brown Hindu; 
Where through each vein spontaneous plenty flowed, 
Where Wealth enjoyed, and Charity bestowed. 
Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet 
Each splendid square, and still, untrodden street; {170} 
Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time, 
The broken stair with perilous step shall climb, 
Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round, 
By scattered hamlets trace its antient bound, 
And, choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey {175} 
Through reeds and sedge pursue his idle way. 
  With throbbing bosoms shall the wanderers tread 
The hallowed mansions of the silent dead, 
Shall enter the long isle and vaulted dome 
Where Genius and where Valour find a home; {180} 
Awe-struck, midst chill sepulchral marbles breathe, 
Where all above is still, as all beneath; 
Bend at each antique shrine, and frequent turn 
To clasp with fond delight some sculptured urn, 
The ponderous mass of Johnson's form to greet, {185} 
Or breathe the prayer at Howard's sainted feet. 

…

Oft shall the strangers turn their eager feet {205} 
The rich remains of antient art to greet, 
The pictured walls with critic eye explore, 
And Reynolds be what Raphael was before. 
On spoils from every clime their eyes shall gaze, 
Egyptian granites and the Etruscan vase; {210} 
And when midst fallen London, they survey 
The stone where Alexander's ashes lay, 
Shall own with humbled pride the lesson just 
By Time's slow finger written in the dust. </Text>

            <Title>ch 5 - networks popularity</Title>
            <Text>Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical — or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream” — printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a taxonomy of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and of authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, and what kind of “alternatives” they offer to the mainstream. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices within the horizon of expectations of the radical circles I (and other scholars) expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.
TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.
TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.</Comments>

            <Title>ch 3 - archive popularity</Title>
            <Text>Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2nd or 10th edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.
Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.</Comments>

            <Text>Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices. Its extended discussion (and, at points, critique) of the practice of critique highlights similarities between conversations about reading in the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries. For example, when Felski hyperbolically lists the “unserious” reading practices which are presumed to be the only alternative to critique, “naive reading, sentimental effusion, impressionistic judgment, fuzzy-headed amateurism, and mere ‘chatter about Shelley’,” sentimentality is explicitly named alongside forms of ‘sloppy’ thinking that are presumed to be incompatible with rationality. The need to maintain rationality in the face of emotion takes on moral implications in Felski’s hyperbole as well: without critique, the question goes, “what will save us from perdition, what will keep us from committing all those sins we’ve been warned against,” what will keep us from being dangerously bad readers? Of course, part of Felski’s conclusion is that these forms of “bad reading” are not, despite their emotional contamination, morally wrong or intellectual vacuous — but like Sedgwick, she sketches her alternative lightly.</Text>

            <Text>In its broadest strokes, this narrative is probably mostly true, and can certainly be useful. Nonetheless, I wish to complicate it by seeking to reconcile “major” works with their “minor” peers, and by foregrounding what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. My interest in noncanonical works stems from a desire to recognize the real variety of responses expressed throughout the period in question. Even when one literary affective mode is at its peak popularity, other opinions are being expressed and other tools are being employed. [Just because an idea doesn’t “win” its year doesn’t make it uninteresting; rather, the opposite.] Moreover, individual authors evolve in opinion over time, and even individuals works change in meaning over time, hence my interest in timeliness.</Text>

            <Text>A chronological anthology is structured by the assuption that the most important context for a work is not who it is by, but when it was produced. Author comes second. This reverses the traditional anthology (Norton etc), which is structured by the assumption that the most important context for a work is the author who produced it, with chronology as a second concern.
Author is of course an important component! But it can also promote the false idea that changes within an author’s body of work are mostly due to personal matters or artistic evolution, rather than being responses to other works being produced or to changes in the world at large. </Text>

            <Title>ch 1 - what's not novels?</Title>
            <Text>Chapter one takes up the eternal problem of archival gaps, and asks how we might interrogate or fill these gaps with computational methods. It asks how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to fascimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disaparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.
Current materials acquired include:
	•	51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue
	•	42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online
	•	10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online
	•	4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library
	•	466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership
Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).
The first chapter thus introduces my decade of interest and the materials and perspectives I bring to bear on it, laying the foundation for my future questions about literary popularity and literary legacy.</Text>

Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts. Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.</Text>

            <Text>Reforming the Gothic reader in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads
Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]
Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)
My project filling the gap: Hannah More!
Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.
[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

            <Text>** Use the word vector exercises from DH2018 workshop

Word embeddings allow for analogy checking. For example, man is to king as woman is to queen, expressed as man:king :: woman:queen, has its reflection on the vector representions of the words man, king, woman, queen in such a way that  king→−man→+woman→≈queen→king→−man→+woman→≈queen→ . However, this can also highlight some biases in the specific corpora the model has been trained on. Using as a base the pair she-he, find the most similar term for female from the term in the next list: doctor, captain, gallant, sheriff, engineer, scientist, author, surgeon, honorable, philosopher, warrior, architect, magician, liar, and coward. 
When possible, compute the similarity between the expected term for female and the one for male. Use the Google News (2015), English Fiction (1900, 1950) and Genre-Balanced American English (1900, 1950) embeddings. For example, using the English Fiction 1850 embeddings, he:gallant :: she:x solves to x=gentle, and the similarity between gallant and gentle is ~0.418. Can you spot the problem? 
Hint: Use Gensim's most_similar_cosmul()/most_similar() and similarity() functions

Really cherry-picking the "interesting" results; scroll right past the total nonsense and latch onto anything that can be vaguely thinks

By comparing how different the he:X :: she:X results are, we can quantify the gendered bias within the corpus, to skeptically evaluate our corpora

Very hard to remove gendered bias without removing the other relationships that interest us

Not just corpora that are biased; because the algorithm depends on the corpus, it will become biased too</Text>

            <Title>popularity</Title>
            <Text>“It may be that Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads affiliates his own verse with the oral tradition of popular ballads that might seem the best recourse for a poet dedicated to the ‘principle of equality’, but it would be hard to claim that Wordsworth’s poems show a knowledge of that tradition equal to Walter Scott’s, nor that they were so deeply influenced by it, nor that they succeeded in addressing so wide an audience, and no one would claim either that Scott’s Muse was a levelling one, or that Scott developed a poetic style, whatever the claims Lukacs has made for the novels, that expressed the principles of the French Revolution.” (16) 

“The first period is characterized by the attempt to frame a universal language, a language in which it might be possible to address all of humanity. The most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status was the language of science, and hence it is appropriate that the most celebrated poet of these years, Erasmus Darwin, was concerned ‘to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science’. (16)

“Erasmus Darwin was the most popular poet of the 1790s, and his The Botanic Garden (1791), in which The Economy of Vegetation formed the first part, and The Loves of Plants (1789) the second, was the decade’s most popular poem.” (29) “The beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden published by Joseph Johnson in 1791, with its elegant typefaces, and its engravings from Fuseli and others, in itself proclaims a confidence in the book’s unusual importance. … His edition of Darwin’s poem registers his recognition of the book’s commercial prospects but also his recognition that the poem gave vivid expression to a set of / beliefs shared by Johnson’s stable of authors, and his confidence that in 1791 such beliefs could be expressed triumphally, by the publication of a volume as costly and elegant as one of Wedgwood’s copies of the Portland Vase, itself reproduced by Blake in the book’s most elaborate engraving.” (29-30)

“Throughout the period treated in this book successive governments made a more sustained and vigorous attempt to prevent the publication of Paine’s writings than those of any other radical propagandist, and the reason is obvious enough. They correctly detected in Tom Paine’s prose the achievement of the alliance between intellectual and popular radicalism that they most feared. Their campaign was strikingly unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent Paine’s works becoming more widely available through cheap reprints than the works of any other contemporary writer, and yet the consequence they feared never came to pass.” (59)
“But it would be idle to deny that it remains for all that an entirely eccentric text. Up to a point Blake’s printing methods in themselves account for this. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell exists in nine complete and two incomplete copies, and it seems improbable that very many more copies were ever produced. The contrast with the thousands of copies circulating of Paine’s Rights of Man needs no underlining. But it would be idle to pretend that the Marriage, even if Blake had devised a way of printing that made possible a wide circulation, would ever have achieved wide popularity, and this was not because Blake as an eccentric, but because his project was.” (60) “in making such an attempt Blake is likely to succeed only in writing the manifesto of a party of which he is the only member” (60)

“Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means — the original two volumes of the Minstrelsy sold for a guinea. James Ballantyne’s printing of the volumes works in tandem with Scott’s editorial work to secure this effect. Typefaces elegantly distinguish the ballads from their editorial matter, and the ballads themselves are displayed with an opulent disregard for economy, no more than eighteen lines to the page, so that the 134 lines of ‘Johnnie Armstrong’ occupy eight pages of the first volume.” (94)</Text>

            <Text>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history":
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."
It requires research and study, in order to identify and disentangle the many projects and effects within a work; we must know which parts to discard and which to nurture, to render something useful to ourselves, and we must know what exists for us to repurpose: this is why I study literature. And it requires instruction in order to allow students to get past, e.g., "I thought I was supposed to respect Mrs Bennet" to the literary riches within: this is why I teach literature.
(Literature, unlike history, is permitted artistic license.)
This constant re-translation allows us to continue conferring and experiencing value to the work of previous generations. I don't value the past or tradition simplistically, or for the virtue of merely being older; but we do not always have to reinvent the wheel, and seeing that things were different in the past can allow us to remember that they will be different in the future.
(Though I suppose, since I proceed on the assumption that it is not possible to perceive or understand the "now," I do often dismiss the contemporary as insufficiently informative to be getting on with.)</Text>

            <Title>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British</Title>
            <Text>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British Novel (1994) also investigates the associations between fictional form and politics. For Watson, novelists on both sides of the Revolution debate realised that there was a clear connection between some major themes of the novel and the political debates of the 1790s. The sentimental novel’s depiction of a heroine choosing her own lover in defiance of parental authority,for example,might correlate with disobedience towards political authority,just as an attempted seduction of a heroine could stand for the attempts of insurgents to tempt unwary Britons into sedition. Watson argues that both conservative and radical novelists tried to exploit these metaphorical connections, making the majority of 1790s novels much more political that they might at first appear. Even the very form of the novel,Watson contends, was a political statement in itself. Epistolary novels, for instance, were inherently political because the letter was a deeply suspect article in the 1790s, standing for secret communi- cation between people and connected with espionage, with the evidence used in treason trials and with the radical ‘corresponding societies’ (established in Britain to communicate directly with the Revolutionaries in France). </Text>

Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.
When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.

            <Text>My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the existing digital archives of the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade, with some discussion of celebrity as it manifests in print culture. Chapter four turns its attention to the radical press, and the social ties underlying radical writing and publishing. A potential fifth chapter could explore the penetration of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode; I would be interested to see what percentage of works during the decade can be said to contain Gothic materials.</Text>

            <Title>intro</Title>
            <Text>I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.
I’m interested in strategies of feeling as an ethical concern which lives on today with discussions of reparative reading, and I’m interested in textual timeliness as subject matter that can shed light on the individuality of text’s strategies of feelings through bibliographical and computational research.
My thinking has led me to a methodology, a subject matter, and a philosophical/emotional stance.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change.</Text>

            <Title>Wordsworth &amp; More</Title>
            <Text>let’s see, looking though my notes — looks like William Wordsworth writes a ton of poems that are just incredibly pretentious versions of Hannah More’s stories/ballads
Alex: “has that been said before. god I hate wordsworth
such a mansplainer
so that would be a great topic”
Michael Gamer has said, essentially, that Wordsworth is writing more pretentious versions of popular ghost stories
Alex: “proving that he is one of those dudes in a meeting who repeats what the woman said but louder
but no one Hannah More especially?”
no, Hannah More hates ghost stories for the same reason Wordsworth does — they are vulgar and unchristian
but she uses them anyway, the same way wordsworth does
to subvert them into morally improving tales
or, well, WW is less clear w/ moral improvement of individual poems
but Gamer makes a compelling argument re: his overall claim to have “elevated” his material
Alex: “is there room to argue against Gamer, or to move it in another direction then?”
I don’t know that More is a specific source for Wordsworth; it’s not impossible, but also not immediately likely to me. What interests me is the similarity of their rhetorical stance toward their material and their shared mission of “elevating” for moral improvement, contrasted with their success — Wordsworth has got everybody buying his propaganda, More not so much
Alex: “well, he is a dude.......
but I see the question, and how it relates to the question about 1790s you have formulated...
certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business.”
hmmm.. Gamer is mostly making a broader argument about the Gothic as the immediate source for Romanticism, whereas More is essentially orthogonal to Romanticism…
(I agree with &amp; really like Gamer’s argument about the Gothic &amp; Romanticism)
More want to repurpose and “elevate” the Gothic for essentially evangelical Christian ends — it is astonishing how much I like her, really, given that she is the perfect precursor to all those meddling Victorian moralist middle-class ladies
Alex: “right, but you are still seeing something new there, about More, that both fits in with an is distinct from Gamer - and is core to your questions about your period”
yeah, I think I would use Gamer as a leaping-off point to pursue this slightly separate track, about other attempts to elevate/repurpose popular writing
Alex: “sounds chapter-able. very good.”</Text>

            <Title>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems</Title>
            <Text>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems (1986). Writing broadly in the tradition of Marxist criticism Levinson theorised interestingly about the relationship between history and literature in her Rethinking Historicism (1989), but it was her new readings of ostensibly unpolitical poems such as the ‘Intimations of Immortality’ ode and ‘Tintern Abbey’ in the earlier book which have had the most lasting effect. For her, political events were vital in shaping Wordsworth’s verse, even when they were apparently absent. His choice of images could reveal the link Levinson argued. An apparently innocuous reference to a solitary ‘tree’, for example, might allude to the French tree of liberty, or his ‘single field’ to the Champ de Mars. But it was the omissions that were more important, representing a deliberate suppression of political optimism and its replacement with a new system of belief, the ‘myth of the soul’ at the core of the Intimations ode. For the disenchanted Wordsworth, latching on to new ideals in the poem,‘there are victories’, wrote Levinson, 
far greater than those once anticipated from the French Revolution. Rather than grieve over those mundane losses, the reader is exhorted to set his sights on those other and spiritual palms . . . the ‘soothing thoughts that spring / Out of human suffering.’ (Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems 93–4, 98–9) 
Such an approach has perhaps proved so influential because it helps to explain, and perhaps even authorise, Wordsworth’s rather forlorn retreat from his youthful idealism. </Text>

            <Title>model 2: ECCO-TCP</Title>
            <Text>I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.</Text>

Although much of Drucker’s discussion of our contemporary relationship to visual interfaces is tangential to this project, her monograph includes a highly-relevant discussion of the use of data visualizations in varying disciplines. This discussion expands on her 2011 article “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” (Digital Humanities Quarterly 5.1) to highlight the importance of avoiding a false appearance of observer-independent objective truth in humanities visualizations. Her warnings will continue to shape my own creation and use of visualizations as I seek to make sense of my large bodies of information.

Alyssa Fowers:

	If 60% is the threshold you would want to stick with in a corpus that had perfect gender parity overall, that is an odds ratio of 1.5: among books with that tag, the odds of a book with the tag being by a woman are 1.5 times higher than the odds of the book being by a man
Lawrence Evalyn:

            <Title>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London</Title>
            <Text>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London Stage, 1789–1805 (2000), follows the same general line of argument. Taylor shows that although smaller theatres had been able to avoid the Lord Chamberlain’s restrictions at the time the Revolution broke out, and had therefore been able to exhibit some enthusiastic dramatisations of events in Paris, censorship was quickly imposed across all London theatres. This forced engagement with the Revolution to become more covert. Censorship meant that British radical writers ‘had to relinquish the theatre as a means of rational instruction’, and political comment was forced into seemingly unlikely theatrical modes: musical entertainments, pantomimes, and above all a new offshoot of the gothic, the melodrama (99). Throughout the 1790s, Taylor argues, political anxieties and hopes were represented by metaphor, images of imprisonment, blindness or dispossession being routinely employed as veiled but recognisable references to current events.

            <Title>DH as historical breach</Title>
            <Text>“Digital humanities” is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke’s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified “digital humanities” work.</Text>

            <Title>Chi squared test</Title>
            <Text>OKAY, so, this is way less ~science~ than it probably appears, but: the rule of thumb for chi squared tests is to only do them when the expected value (if the null hypothesis is true) in any given cell is 5 or greater. In this case, we would have 4 cells (has tag/male, has tag/female, does not have tag/male, does not have tag/female), and the null hypothesis would be that the tags are just as likely to be in mens’ work as in womens’ work
(It could also probably work as a 2 cell test, and the nuances of which it should be are slightly above my read-about-this-for-10-minutes pay grade, but it doesn’t matter because you aren’t actually doing the test)
So the expected value in each cell would have to be 5 or above, which means that you would need at least 10 total works with the tag

Alyssa Fowers:
	this is less science-y than it appears because there are other statistical tests that you could do with smaller sample sizes, hOWEVER
	it’s something to go off of!
Lawrence Evalyn:
	thank you so much!!!!
Alyssa Fowers:
	and the chi-squared test is definitely the basic test you’d be most likely to use in this case


Alyssa Fowers:
	Actually, crud, what is the general % of mens/womens/unknown works in this set?
Lawrence Evalyn:
	uh, more women than men, lemme see
	His corpus is 43% female, 31% male, 26% unknown.
Alyssa Fowers:
	Ohhh okay, hm
Lawrence Evalyn:
	215 f, 156 m -- 58% female
Alyssa Fowers:
	So you’d want at least 5 in each group you’re looking at *if* it matched the distribution of the sample, I think
Lawrence Evalyn:
	(if we ignore the unsigned works)
Alyssa Fowers:
	you wouldn’t expect 50% men/50% women in a tag from this corpus--that would indicate an unusual number of men wrote about the thing. Let me math real quick
Lawrence Evalyn:
	so I guess my null hypothesis is, if there are 10 books, there should be 6 by women and 4 by men
Alyssa Fowers:
	(if we ignore unsigned works)
	Yeah

Alyssa Fowers:
	So you’d want 13 total works
	not including unsigned ones
Lawrence Evalyn:
	ok!
Alyssa Fowers:
	so that you could have at least 5 men
Lawrence Evalyn:
	because that would be 5 men and 8 women
Alyssa Fowers:
	Yeha
	I’m rounding up slightly because I don’t think you could have 12.5 women</Text>

            <Text>Norton p 563, Hazlitt on Coleridge:
“It was in ths room that we found a little worn-out copy of the Seasons, lying in a window seat, on which Coleridge exclaimed, ‘That is true fame!’ He said Thompson was a great poet, rather than a good one; his style was as meretricious as his thoughts were natural. He spoke of Cowper as the best modern poet. He said the Lyrical Ballads were an experiment about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been attempted, and making use only of such words as had probably been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.”</Text>

            <Title>ch 4 - networks</Title>
            <Text>Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Jon Mee, Kevin Gilmartin and Paul Keen are others who would be important here. Plus scholars who focus more on conservatism, perhaps M. O. Grenby for example? Or even much earlier work by Marilyn Butler?
Per Terry’s suggestions, I would likely begin here with Jon Klancher, The Making of English Reading Audiences, 1790-1832; Marcus Wood, Radical Satire and Print Culture, 1790-1822; and David Worrall, Radical Culture: Discourse, Resistance, and Surveillance, 1790-1820. Other promising titles include Social networks in the long eighteenth century : clubs, literary salons, textual coteries, ed. Ileana Baird; and The enlightenment &amp; the book : Scottish authors &amp; their publishers in eighteenth-century Britain, Ireland &amp; America, by Richard B. Sher, to capture different parts of the publishing landscape.</Comments>

            <Title>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993</Title>
            <Text>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993) goes furthest in investigating the cultural and political significance of the also very neglected gothic plays – a ‘popular literary mode’ in the 1780s and a ‘mania’ in the 1790s (149). In Backscheider’s analysis these plays were easily applicable to the politics of the 1790s, over and over again depicting villainous aristocrats violating the sanctity of life, liberty, property and female chastity, and powerful crowds able to overthrow them. But, she quickly adds, ‘Year by year, the plays show stronger and stronger strategies of containment’ (226). They characterise mob-rule as being just as inimical as despotism, and they represent the virtuous and legitimate protagonists as able to conquer abuses and restore order though non-confrontational means. Ultimately then, the plays ‘propagated a comforting vision of community, of human nature, and of a providential, benignly ordered world’ (232). More powerfully still, they provided a safety valve for a nervous and agitated public: 
By acting out repressed anxieties and hopes in overt and symbolic representations, the plays released tensions and made social contradictions momentarily innocuous. Social antagonism became opportunities to demonstrate the idealized British self-image and to confirm that no revolution was needed in their country . . . The aristocrats could be restrained and the poor would be taken care of . . . Conflict became spectacle, a containable and consumable product. (233)

Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.</Text>

            <Title>Cronin, Politics of Romantic Poetry</Title>
            <Text>Good lit review. Major monographs: Marilyn Butler’s Romantics, Rebels, and Reactionaries; Jerome McGann’s The Romantic Ideology. Revised by Clifford Siskin, The History of Romantic Discourse.
“Butler and McGann share an ambition to ‘historicize’ Romanticism, and both assume that to historicize is also to politicize. Butler’s account is admirable in its directness and clarity, but its virtues are expensively purchased by maintaining a system of values which, if consistently applied, would support the view that Erasmus Darwin is a better poet than Wordsworth. McGann, by comparison, adopts values which are certainly flexible enough to avoid any such uncomfortable consequence, but he achieved his flexibility only at the risk of inconsistency.” (9)
Siskin is very into sonnets, which I like.
“Butler, McGann, and Siskin… tend to the view that all poetry is political, because, to put it more crudely than any of them would agree to, to write a non-political poem is itself a political act, something like abstaining in a General Election.” (12) “On the face of it, this could be true only if the field of politics were coextensive with reality, and there are some who have argued quite persuasively that this is indeed effectively the case, for in writing reality cannot be encountered, but only represented, and any representation of reality might be said to serve political ends.” (12)
“the kind of political poetry with which I will be concerned, poetry that speaks to a divided society in an attempt to constitute its readers as citizens of what Hill calls, remembering a passage from Hopkins, the just kingdom, and that I prefer to nominate in an echo of Wordsworth ‘the pure commonwealth’. … This will be a book committed to the notion that the political import of a poem is a function of its style quite as much as of its sentiments, and that a poet’s most effective political act is the forging of a new language.” (13)

“It may be that Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads affiliates his own verse with the oral tradition of popular ballads that might seem the best recourse for a poet dedicated to the ‘principle of equality’, but it would be hard to claim that Wordsworth’s poems show a knowledge of that tradition equal to Walter Scott’s, nor that they were so deeply influenced by it, nor that they succeeded in addressing so wide an audience, and no one would claim either that Scott’s Muse was a levelling one, or that Scott developed a poetic style, whatever the claims Lukacs has made for the novels, that expressed the principles of the French Revolution.” (16)  “There is no simple equivalence that allows us to judge the relative radicalism of a text by the width of the readership it addresses… Simpson’s book, for example, is lucid, vigorously written, and free from forbidding jargon, but one would have to accept, surely, that its idiom excluded from its readership the great bulk of ‘ordinary men and women’, and it does not follow from this that Simpson’s politics are latently conservative.” (16)

Summary of book:
“Like Butler and McGann, I will divide the Romantic period into three phases: the early period dominates by the Revolution and the Revolutionary war, the time when, as Wordsworth recalled, he and many of his fellow poets found themselves in support of their country’s ‘nominal enemies’; the period of the Napoleonic wars when Britain was in danger of defeat, even invasion; and the immediately post-war period, dominated in Britain by popular unrest. In each case my purpose will be, not to offer a survey of poetry written in the period, but to identify a dominant discourse, and to analyze its limitations.” (16)
“The first period is characterized by the attempt to frame a universal language, a language in which it might be possible to address all of humanity. The most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status was the language of science, and hence it is appropriate that the most celebrated poet of these years, Erasmus Darwin, was concerned ‘to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science’. The language framed by Darwin justifies its claim to universality, in part, by rejecting supernatural in favour of natural explanations of phenomena, that is, by excluding religion. Given that differences of religious belief were among the most powerfl forces of division in his world, his tactic is entirely logical, but it results in a paradox. Darwin framed a languages that addresses all of humanity only by rigorously excluding the large majority of human individuals / who were united in their posession of a religious faith, however much they may have been divided by the faiths that they professed. Darwin’s poetry forces one to the conclusion that a universal language may be among the more exclusive idioms available to a poet. I turn then, as a counter to Darwin, to his most talented illustrator, William Blake, who in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell framed a language designed to reconcile the kind of intellectual radicalism shared by Dawin, Priestley and the rest of the literary set that gathered around the publisher Joseph Johnson with the radicalism of the streets, which was apt to express itself in the mode of Biblical prophecy, and to flaunt its own outrageous credulity as a flamboyant rejection of godless common sense. In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell the attempt to produce a work that could be read by all of Blake’s fellow-radicals results, and count only result, in a text remarkable for its massive idiosyncracy. Finally, I turn to Southey and Landor, who courageously continues to write an international poetry at a time when the nations were at war. In them, the attempt to devise a universal language assumes its latest guise: it becomes the mark of the traitor.” (16-7)
“The book’s second part begins with Walter Scott, for Scott, like Erasmus Darwin before him, framed most powerfully the language of the new period, which was not a language designed to unite all mankind but to unite the nation in its war against the French. But all Scott’s poems are set in the past. … no description of Scott’s Britain could avoid encountering the economic, geographical, and political differences that divided the kingdom, a fact which emerges with some clarity when I turn to Wordsworth’s Poems in Two Volumes, a collection which attempted to resolve the differences of his fellow citizens, and succeeded only in provoking a hostility so intense that Wordsworth was deterred from publishing his poems for some years. This section ends with another paradox, the emergence at the very end of the war years of a new poet to usurp Scott’s place as … the chief poet of the nation. It was a station that Byron earned by systematically and flamboyantly refusing any suprapersonal loyalty.” (17)
“The book’s third part is concerned with the post-war years, when the conflict between nations was supplanted by an internal conflict between classes. In the work by Byron and Shelley discussed there the poetic identity that the two poets had chosen as ‘genteel reformers’ becomes itself problematic, with the consequence that, as both recognize, poetic style could no longer disengage itself from class conflict. The book ends / with the Cockney poets, with Leigh Hunt and Keats, who cannot find, any more that Byron or Shelley, a poetic language that subsumes class difference, but who devise a language in which those differences may be uncomfortably contained.” (17-8)
“In his great preface Wordsworth defines the poet as ‘a man speaking to men’. It is the project that unites all the poets that appear in this book, and it is a project in which all of them failed, and not simply because they neglected to address women. They failed because they wrote at a time when there was no language aailable that could address itself to the ‘one human heart’ that they were confident all of us share. This book charts that failure in each of its three phases, each of them presided over, perhaps, by a single iconic figure. Presiding over the first phase is Anarcharsis Cloots, so touchingly dedicated to universal revolution that he once confessed his ambition to establish a republic on the moon, and so confident of the universal power of his own rhetoric that he designated himself ‘Orator of the Human Race’. Nelson presides over the second phase, at the moment when he ordered the signal flags raised before the Battle of Trafalgar, conscious that, despite all his personal peculiarities, at this moment he speaks for ‘England’. The characteristic figure of the third phase is ‘Orator’ Hunt, ‘Bristol’ Hunt, or simply Henry, ascending the platform to make his speech to the thousands gathered at St Peter’s ield in Manchester, recognizable to everyone by virture of his trademark white top hat. That speech was never made, but was forestalled by a cavalry charge by the local militia, a graphic enough demonstration that in 1819 the language that spoke to one section of the population instilled in another only a fierce desire that it should be silenced.” (18)

Section One
Introduction
“the poem never seems confident of whom it is addressing” (24) on Coleridge’s “Religious Musings”
“Its hesitation summarize those of a decade in which poets tried to locate some commanding position from which they could survey the political turmoil through which they were living, only to find that the prophetic voice, the voice removed from time, was unavailable to them, and a decade in which they tried to locate a voice that could harmonize, like Coleridge’s ‘glad stream’, the diverse and contradictory currents that together constituted the English radical tradition only to find that no such voice was available.” (28)

Chapter 1: Erasmus Darwin: From the Bastille to Birmingham
“Erasmus Darwin was the most popular poet of the 1790s, and his The Botanic Garden (1791), in which The Economy of Vegetation formed the first part, and The Loves of Plants (1789) the second, was the decade’s most popular poem.” (29) “The beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden published by Joseph Johnson in 1791, with its elegant typefaces, and its engravings from Fuseli and others, in itself proclaims a confidence in the book’s unusual importance. … His edition of Darwin’s poem registers his recognition of the book’s commercial prospects but also his recognition that the poem gave vivid expression to a set of / beliefs shared by Johnson’s stable of authors, and his confidence that in 1791 such beliefs could be expressed triumphally, by the publication of a volume as costly and elegant as one of Wedgwood’s copies of the Portland Vase, itself reproduced by Blake in the book’s most elaborate engraving.” (29-30)
P. 39-40 — Darwin uses poetry as sugar to make the medicine of rational essays/footnotes go down more smoothly
P. 45 - Darwin’s poem leaves out the very poor, who riot in 1791 and damage property of Priestly, who wants to enfranchise them
“It was not Erasmus Darwin who developed a poetry that could speak to, and out of, the popular radicalism of the 1790s, but the most inventive of his illustrators, William Blake” (47)

Chapter 2: Williams Blake and Revolutionary Prophecy
“The central difficulty of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is the problem of who it was written for.” (48) - a takedown of a Swedenbog piece written for the Johnson circle?
“Throughout the period treated in this book successive governments made a more sustained and vigorous attempt to prevent the publication of Paine’s writings than those of any other radical propagandist, and the reason is obvious enough. They correctly detected in Tom Paine’s prose the achievement of the alliance between intellectual and popular radicalism that they most feared. Their campaign was strikingly unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent Paine’s works becoming more widely available through cheap reprints than the works of any other contemporary writer, and yet the consequence they feared never came to pass.” (59)
“But it would be idle to deny that it remains for all that an entirely eccentric text. Up to a point Blake’s printing methods in themselves account for this. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell exists in nine complete and two incomplete copies, and it seems improbable that very many more copies were ever produced. The contrast with the thousands of copies circulating of Paine’s Rights of Man needs no underlining. But it would be idle to pretend that the Marriage, even if Blake had devised a way of printing that made possible a wide circulation, would ever have achieved wide popularity, and this was not because Blake as an eccentric, but because his project was.” (60) “in making such an attempt Blake is likely to succeed only in writing the manifesto of a party of which he is the only member” (60)

Chapter 3: The English Jacobins
“1798 was the year of The Anti-Jacobin. In its first incarnation, as a weekly review, it survived for only 37 issues, but by 9 July 1798, when the last of these appeared, its work was done.” (61)
“The Anti-Jacobin succeeded by being more Jacobinical than its enemies, by being itself so uncompromising that it successfully forced compromise on its opponents. The Jacobin was established as a compound beast, made up of impiety, lack of patriotism, profligacy, sentimentality, inhuman rationality, murderous violence, a character so Protean, adepts at assuming so many disguises, that it seemed monstrous even to the ‘Jacbobins’ themselves.” (69)
“Only two substantial Jacobin poems were published in 1798. One of them was Southey’s second edition of Joan of Arc, the other a poem of which Southey was the first and greatest admirer, Landor’s Gebir.” (74)
“Landor founf the story of his poem in a translation from the French by Clara Reeves, ‘The History of Charoba, Queen of Egypt’, appended to her The Progress of Romance, a lengthy dialogue in which a pair of learned ladies defend, to the astonished admiration of their male adversary,the claim that prose fiction, the romance, should be granted a status equal to that of epic poetry. Landor, he tells us, came across the book ‘on the shelf of a circulating library’, and he affects a loftily dismissive response to it… But there is reason for suspecting that he was more receptive to Reeves’s argument than he finds it politic to admit.” (74)
“It is a Jacobin vision, and it concludes the last Jacobin poem to be published in England until Shelley was to reinvent a modified version of the kind some fifteen years later. Gebir is Jacobin in its internationalism, in a geographical sweep that takes the poem from the Iberian peninsula to Egypt, and then to the new western world, presumably America… it is Jacobin, too, in employing this internationalist rhetoric to articulate a condemnation of Britain in its war against France. It is Jacobin in its contempt of / royalty, in its fierce anti-militarism, and in maintaining the myth of an original, natural state of peaceful plenty, the birthright of all, until mankind was cheated of it by the machinations of warmongering kings. It it Jacobin in its distrust of the recalcitant prejudices of the ‘vulgar’, and in its desire to redraw the boundaries both of gender and of  genre. But by 1798 it was already a Jacobin poem written out of its time, and it carries the marks of its belatedness.” (79-80) “In part the poem suffers simply from the accident of its timing. It was unlucky to publish a poem that figured the English war against France bu an Iberian invasion of Egypy at a time when Napoleon was about to sail for Egypt at the head of his army of occupation.” (80)
“The brave ambition of Jacobin poetry is to escape from history, like the French revolutionaries to rewrite the calendar so that tie miht begin again, all the distinctions that deformed the old world obliterated” (81)

Section Two
Chapter 4: Walter Scott and Anti-Gallican Minstrelsy
“Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means — the original two volumes of the Minstrelsy sold for a guinea. James Ballantyne’s printing of the volumes works in tandem with Scott’s editorial work to secure this effect. Typefaces elegantly distinguish the ballads from their editorial matter, and the ballads themselves are displayed with an opulent disregard for economy, no more than eighteen lines to the page, so that the 134 lines of ‘Johnnie Armstrong’ occupy eight pages of the first volume.” (94)
“By the time that Scott began to write the economic intregration of Scotland and England was well advanced. The publication history of Marmion itself serves to indicate this.” (105)

Funny quips
“Anyone offering yet another book on the politics of Romantic poetry might reasonably be asked to present a fairly convincing excuse.” (2)
“But then we read that Wordswoth’s ‘secondary’ period is ‘brief to the point of / non-existence’, because, at the date when Wordsworth ought to have begun writing secondary poems, 1808, he started to write bad poems instead.” (7-8)
“It is [Erasmus] Darwin’s treatment of gender and of sexuality that is most distinctive in his verse. His enthusiasm for breast-feeding is predictable enough, as is his hostility to mothers who are ‘bless’d in vain with timid bosoms’, and respond to the ‘tender wailings’ of their infants with ‘unfeeling ear’.” (36)</Text>

            <Text>“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)
“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)
“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and that there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

“The "favorite authors" are all women: Anna Maria Bennett, Regina Maria Roche, Elizabeth [sic] Meeke, Agnes Musgrave, Anna Howell, Mary Charlton, Isabella Kelly, Elizabeth Parsons, Elizabeth Bonhote, and Anna Maria M’Kenzie.” (39)

"Lane claims "All the Works complete of Robertson, Johnson, Henry, Hume, Locke, Pope, Rapin, Goldsmith, Milton, Smollett, Richardson, Garrick, Gibbons, Voltaire, Addison, Rollin, Littleton, Sterne, Shakespeare, Bolingbroke, Fielding, &amp;c.," as well as “every Author of the present Age”” (40)

"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels." (42)

“At the Minerva Press, William Lane, who had printed 11 items in the 1770s and 131 in the 1780s, produced 402 in the 1790s.” (48)

"Of a total of 1036 works published between 1790 and 1820, on average 27% are texts other than novels. ... these texts include 67 different types of compilations, including collections of maxims, sermons, hymns, fairy tales, fables, songs, jokes, and travel accounts, as well as 52 books of instruction on a wide range of subjects including spelling, cooking, brewing, parenting, farriery, medicine, and military matters.” (52)

"I did not take my set of sub-genres from any pre-existing list, but developed it through my own reading of several hundred Minerva novels." (54)

“works may be classified in more than one category. Thus, a work may appear in two categories within a table (as in both epistolary and sentimental) or be listed in both tables (as in translation and courtship).” (56)

￼(57)

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200).

            <Text>My first chapter sets out the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will discuss, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are seeking to develop less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this this eleven-year “decade” to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s will highlight a decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women writers. Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history was filtered into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.</Text>
            <Comments>Is there a better term? (why did TK think I wanted “anti-interpretive”?)
TK: Can you clarify this? Are you talking about the focus of the recent scholarship, or the focus of the writers at the time? As you rightly indicate elsewhere, these two things may not match -- your project might show the preoccupations of modern scholarship to be projections of our own rather than an accurate reflection of what dominated at the time. But “decade-long focus” makes it sound as though you’re talking about the 1790s writers themselves, i.e. accepting that “our” 1790s (dominated by, say, Thelwall and Wollstonecraft) is the same as the “real” one (though that might turn out to have been dominated by, say, Edmund Burke and Hannah More).
Although all of these elements interest me, and I anticipate that attention to this decade will reveal their prominence, I seek to avoid framing my inquiry explicitly around them and thus begging the question of their importance.</Comments>

The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics.

            <Title>embrace of marginalization</Title>
            <Text>me I think I've talked to you about this also? the escapist fantasy, in a novel where women are powerless to do anything but cry when kidnapped, is that the crying will work
hbbo oh, huh--I don't think we have had this conversation, but that makes a lot of sense
me I've been thinking, also, about the virtues of the Gothic as a narrative mode which doesn't truck with any bullshit about women's place in the world. Powerful men are tyrants who can destroy you! Your feelings are correct on that front! You are excruciatingly vulnerable! And now here is a story where everything turns out okay anyway.
hbbo yes. a space in which to really lug out all those repressed anxieties and blow them up as big as they're able to go can be very cathartic for sure and not only cathartic but useful
me yeah, yeah The contemporary narrative of an "empowering" story for women is about women having power, and indeed a lot of criticism looks at these works to try to find the particular womanly kinds or spheres of power that make the texts "subversive" or "progressive"... and I do see some of that, there is a compelling thread of women having access to emotional manipulation of men as an effective strategy that makes men look foolish and less powerful
hbbo /me nods
me but I think for the most part they're not trying to say, "you have the incredible power of emotional manipulation!" -- I really think they're wallowing in the abjectness of acknowledging powerlessness and, this is the part that has been firing up my soul, the thing you can do, when you have no power, is you can refuse to endorse your oppressor's actions
hbbo /me nods
me this is a bit of a fantasy too, really, but it's one that speaks to me -- the idea that as long as you make them FORCE you, as long as you don't capitulate, that's -- it's not POWER, but..... hands in the air this is where I don't know what I'm saying yet
hbbo no, yeah, it's at the very least a sort of sovereignty over the self
me ooooooh, yeah sovereignty is a good term for it
me hmm, I'm thinking now that there's also a sort of exposure of tyranny, too. If you refuse to walk with your kidnapper and force him to carry you, you deprive him of some of his illusions
hbbo right I feel like this comes up a lot in like idk, narratives of long captivity, I'm trying to think of examples
me oh, yeah, there would be a connection there
hbbo like in 1984, he talks a lot under torture but it's not until he voluntarily betrays his lover that his selfhood is really broken
me ohhhh, yeah man, I read that novel like a decade too young to get anything out of it, I should revisit it
hbbo I mean, DEBATABLE how voluntary that really is if your alternative is getting your face eaten off by rats, but still
me well, the 18thC heroine ideal is to literally die before, say, signing paperwork allowing someone to take her ancestral property
hbbo yeah I read it ages ago as well ahahahahaha yes
me but that feels like part of the fantasy, this idea that you actually will just get your face eaten off by rats before you betray your own self even if in all other interactions you are timid and delicate 1984 of course not being interested in fantasy</Text>

            <Title>Lesser &amp; Farmer debate</Title>
            <Text>Do these citations with some kind of LaTeX to learn that process
A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer &amp; Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.” Blayney’s “detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays” (F&amp;L 4) argues that “never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books” (B, qtd in F&amp;L 3) and that, based on their reprinting rate of “only” 48% of first editions, “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years” (B, qtd in F&amp;L 4). F&amp;L argue that “ like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books” (F&amp;L 4). In response, therefore, “Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends.” (F&amp;L 4). Total number of editions and frequency of reprinting To properly contextualize market share, they carefully compare plays only to other “speculative” non-monopoly works (L&amp;F 14). “Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest.” (F&amp;L 6). F&amp;L stress that they study playbooks, not playtexts.
The crucial intervention of F&amp;L’s first article is the comparison of playbooks to the marketplace at large, and to another genre (sermons), since “popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (F&amp;L 4). Also useful is the disentanglement of different metrics of popularity, since “Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (F&amp;L 26): “Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”? … For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (F&amp;L 27)</Text>

            <Text>IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability
Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?</Text>

            <Text>Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’</Text>

            <Text>My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade.
My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, I will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty.
My subject matter situates me in a densely-discussed intersection of scholarly fields.

The years 1789-99 make an eleven-year “decade” delimited by the major events of the French Revolution, but also home to a crucial literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form. 
18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernacular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. 
The introduction will also address who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.

            <Text>Writing Timeliness
Whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand, texts take on shifting meanings as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and recontextualized over time. The changing impact of works over time is most obvious in overtly political works like Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, whose relationship with, for example, Helen Maria Williams’ Letters from France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men was directly determined by the extent to which the works in question were considered to have been borne out by political events. But time-sensitive readings, and an expected textual responsiveness for current events, extended to to literary works as well.
Novels which, in scholarly editions, give the illusion of being singular, unified objects are nearly all the result of a more complicated and responsive process of coming into being. As Tristram Shandy was composed and published, for example, each new installment slightly shifted its emphasis, so that the emerging narrative only gradually solidified into what are, in retrospect, its major concerns. Particularly notable is the way that volumes 7 through 9 of Tristram Shandy, written after the publication of The Castle of Otranto, incorporate Gothic materials differently than the earlier volumes; rather than being one text with one interpretation of the role of the supernatural in heightening readerly emotion, Shandy was a phenomenon which unfolded and varied over time. Even works which were not printed in installments, like Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and Walter Scott’s Waverley, could change in content and in popular reception with a new edition.
Similarly, Lyrical Ballads is often studied in the context of its 1798, 1800, and 1802 editions, but William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge seem to have been following standard poetic practice by writing new prefaces, selecting new poems, and re-editing their works for a new emphasis. Charlotte Smith enacts similar changes across the dozen editions of Elegiac Sonnets printed between 1784 and 1812. Smith’s 1797 edition, for example, includes a new preface, re-selects the non-sonnet poems, and adds new sonnets to create a “new” work out of poems which were as many as thirteen years old. The edition presents her as a politically engaged poet, directly relevant to the events of her day, whose radical philosophies are salient even in her earliest sonnets.</Text>

These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.</Text>

            <Text>I want to both do reparative reading and examine how 18thC audiences might have read reparatively.
I look at literature as something that is always ephemeral and timely, always in a moment that has the potential to be momentous — a play and a song and a novel all have their own ways of occupying the lives of their audiences.

            <Text>“we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

Need to look at reprint rates, not just total number of reprints; playbooks twice as likely to be reprinted, even though there were twice as many second-ed sermon books

"Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate. Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more "popular”? After all, both sermons and playbooks seem to have been relatively popular compared to other kinds of books, but according to different criteria. For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different _structures of popularity_” (Farmer and Lesser, “Revisited”, 25-6)</Text>

            <Text>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. </Text>

This collection of essays recaptures the development in Moretti’s career of his theories of literary history as evolutionary and as an imbalanced center-periphery system of exchange, alongside his increasing use of computational methods that come to be known as ‘distant reading.’ Moretti’s interest in accounting for the “great unread” of literature, and his use of computational models to carry out comparative research, provides much of the theoretical background for my own methods. </Text>

            <Text>Betty T. Bennett’s estimate that there were over 3,000 short poems on the war published in newspapers, periodicals, and magazines supports such contemporary claims (BWP&gt; p. ix). Over 200 individual volumes of poetry with titles referring to the war, battles, or military or naval figures, were reviewed in periodicals between 1798 and 1820, a count which obviously excludes those works not reviewed and. does not give any idea of the number of war poems contained in collections of (p.4) verse with non-specific titles.

During the period of the invasion crisis, from 1797 to 1805, poetry, along with, other forms of writing, was seen as almost exclusively devoted to the French threat; as the Gentleman’s Magazine commented, ‘[i]n poetry or prose the universal, object of patriotic Britons is, to pursue and expose the Invader of the rights of human kind’ (p 4)

The British war effort was indeed huge, ‘prima facie at least as big. as France’s’, according to Geoffrey Best, with the regular army expanding from 40,000 men in 1793 to 250,000 in 1813 and the navy from 45,000 sailors in February 1793 to 145,000 in 1812.11 These regular armed forces (p.6) were supplemented by volunteer forces which at the height of the invasion crisis of 1803 numbered as many as 400,000 men.12 It has been estimated that during this period of invasion crisis, from 1797 to 1804, as many as one in six, or even one in five, of all adult males was involved in the armed forces in either a voluntary or an enrolled position.13

They have also been estimated to have cost 315,000 British lives, which, as Best argues, by one statistical method can be presented as a higher proportion of servicemen than that lost in the first world war«15 As David Gates has shown, the casualty rate of the wars was high, with 18,596 dying in 1794 on active service and 40,639 men discharged ‘on account of wounds or infirmity’ over the next two years. The attrition rate remained high throughout the Napoleonic wars, 16,000–24,000 casualties being incurred each year,16 (p. 6)

For example, the broadsheet ballad ‘Millions be Free: A New Song, Tune—“To Anacreon in Heaven”’, part of the Bodleian ballad collection, was also printed in a less radical version as ‘An Ode on the Restoration, of Freedom to France’ in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in January 1793.30 The broadsheet version of this poem, ‘Millions be Free’, written in the context of the French decree of November 1792 offering ‘fraternity and assistance to all peoples who seek to recover their liberty’31 concludes each stanza by looking forward to the spread of revolutionary ideology with a variant of the couplet—‘While FRANCE rises up, and proclaims the DECREE, | That tears off our Chains, and bids MILLIONS BE FREE’. The ‘Ode’ ends each stanza with ‘That tears off their our chains, and bids millions be free’ (emphasis added), which like its title (‘An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France’) and certain subtle but significant changes in tenses, allows the poem to be read as a celebration of the Revolution in France without the broadsheet’s call for the future spread of revolutionary freedom, The ‘Ode’ version illustrates Michael Scrivener’s argument that ambiguity was a necessary feature of much of the radical verse published in newspapers and magazines, enabling a text to satisfy different factions or ‘sides’ (PR.28–9), whereas the anonymous broadsheet version was able to present a more direct and extreme message. As this suggests, texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration (PR 26). (P. 10)

In this context, it is unnecessary and reductive to make too careful a distinction between ‘poetry’ and ‘song’, given that the same text could be experienced in these different ways, though it is important to bear in mind how different realizations of the text may have an impact on its mediation of the war. (P. 11)

As well as its links with the ballad and song tradition, poetry had strong connections to theatrical and visual culture, which also mediated the war to the British public, frequently calling upon a deep-rooted Francophobia which held a strong place in the popular imagination. The theatre provided one arena for the singing of patriotic songs and the performance of bellicose poetry. As Gillian Russell has argued in an excellent study of the interrelation between the theatre and the war, the various elements of ‘an evening’s entertainment at the theatre consisting of music, song, interlude, occasional addresses, afterpieces, pantomime, pageants, and spectacle … considered together. «.… reveal the extent to which the whole enterprise of the theatre at this time was dedicated to the commemoration of the war and the enhancement of patriotic values’.37 ) (P. 12)

Similarly, poetry and visual culture were frequently mutually reinforcing in their constructions of the war. The interrelation of the two forms is well illustrated by the republication in the government-controlled newspaper The Star in December 1793 of David Garrick’s two (p.13) inscriptions written to accompany William Hogarth’s pair of prints, The Invasion39 These prints had been published in March 1756, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years War with France, and Garrick’s verses read like a collection, of the clichés of French and English national identity … The republication of these verses illustrates the extent to which at the outbreak of the war in 1793 there already existed a powerful set of ideas about British and French national identities that could be easily invoked (p.14)through stock, images and phrases.

The poetry of the 1790s often stresses the continuity of the French threat, even if Hogarth’s and Garrick’s embodiment of it in the figures of priests with ‘their axes, wheels and ropes’ are replaced by sansculottes with their guillotine. For example, a widely read poem of 1793, ‘A Word to the Wise, A New Ballad on the Times’,45presents the French ‘Mounseers’(echoing the word used by Garrick) as threatening ‘Englishmen’ in various ways, including stealing their food, teaching them to dance, talking in clubs, murdering women and priests, destroying the institution of marriage, and indulging in wife-swapping and cannibalism, With its (p.15)presentation of dance teachers as a kind of advanced guard, the poem draws on eighteenth-century anxieties about French fashions and interests making England, ‘a province of France’.
— How does he know it’s widely-read?

Just as anti-Gallican and pro-war writers and editors had a range of sources from which they could draw in their representations of the war, so too did ‘the friends of peace’, the various groupings who held a variety of anti-war convictions during the period.47 For example, a feature of the early issues of the Cambridge Intelligencer, which was founded in July 1793 and gained a ‘national reputation as it promoted anti-war opinions’,48 was its republication of earlier poems of anti-war protest, such as John Scott’s ‘The Drum’, first published in his Poetical Works (1782) and widely reprinted (BWP 80). (P. 15)

The continued power of ‘The Dram’ during the wars is illustrated by the pro-war, patriotic parody of it. beginning ‘I love that drum’s inspiring sound’, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1804 (BWP 330). Like its republication of ‘The Drum’, the Cambridge Intelligencer’s publication of a sixteen-line extract from a poem by Bielby Porteous, who became Bishop of London in 1787, written when he was a student at Cambridge in 1759, shows how the anti-war sentiment of the opening years of the war drew on the eighteenth-century enlightenment critique of international conflict. Printed under the title ‘The Bishop of London’s Opinion on War’, the lines present a powerful critique of war as the product of kings’ ‘Ambitions’

While Scott crucially transformed the way in which conflict was imagined during the Napoleonic period, as I will argue his emphasis on poetry’s power in enabling the reader to imagine battle exemplifies one of the era’s key ideas about the representation of war. As a number of critics have observed, for the majority of the population, war, at least in the form of battle, was something that took place outside their immediate experience, Mary A Favret has put this case most forcefully in her essay ‘Coming Home: The Public Spaces of Romantic War’, in which she sees print culture as protecting the population from the conflict, arguing that in ‘the years between 1793 and 1815 when England was almost constantly at war with France, publicity raised a paper shield—a shield of newspaper reports, pamphlets, songs and poems—against the destructive violence of war’.53 Denied the empirical, contact with war’, the population experience it only through the mediating, filtering, and altering forms of intellectual, and. verbal conventions which ‘shield’, ‘cloak’, and even make ‘invisible’ ‘the first major European war in. the era of the public sphere’ (539). In this book I want to counter Favret’s argument by stressing that writers were acutely aware of this sense of distance between the reading public and the war and that they saw the imagination as the means of bridging this gap and of making war visible (p. 18)

For example, when the publication of the Wickham-Barthélemy correspondence in April 1796 brought to an end Coleridge’s hopes that negotiations between Britain and France would lead to peace, he responded by publishing in The Watchman extracts from An Accurate and Impartial Narrative of the War describing the British campaigns of 1794–5, prefacing them with the (p.19) comment: ‘The horrors of war must therefore be re-commenced.—Let those who sit by the fire-side, and hear of them at safe distance attentively peruse the following’.54 Here Coleridge places his faith in an eyewitness account of the treatment of the wounded and of the casualties of war to bridge the gap between the safety of the fireside and the scene of war, but in much of the war writing of the period it was through the ‘imagination’ or ‘fancy’ that readers could themselves become eyewitnesses to the conflict (p. 18)

Though, probably written in 1791 prior to the outbreak of the war with France,72 Southey published ‘To Horror’ in. Poems (1797), where it becomes an important part of the anti-war strand of that volume (in which it was followed by two of Southey’s best known anti-war poems ‘The Soldier’s Wife’ and ‘The Widow’) and he heightened the poem’s attack on war and linked it to the current conflict by attaching to it a lengthy footnote which presented a ‘picture of consummate horror’ in the form of the eyewitness account of the campaign of the British expeditionary force in Flanders in 1793–5 that Coleridge had quoted in The Watchman.73 (P. 24)

If the imaginative grand tour of the sublime ode provided one means of transporting the poet and reader to the battlefield, another poetic (p.25) means of paying an imaginative visit to the scene of conflict was provided by the sub-genre of ‘The Field of Battle’ poem, a category which I have named after Thomas Penrose’s highly popular mid-eighteenth-century work of that name.74 Penrose’s poem remained popular throughout the romantic period; it was republished in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in May 1794 and The Courier in January 1800 and included by Thomas Campbell in his Specimens of the British Poets (1819), as well as being widely adapted.75  (P. 24-5)

As these versions of the ‘Ode to Fancy’ and ‘The Field of Battle’ illustrate, throughout the 1790s poetry was adopted as a form through which the imagination could ‘paint’, ‘picture’ or ‘portray’ war. … The picturing of war through the poetic imagination was used by both those who sought to celebrate war and those who wished to condemn it. (P. 27)

Fawcett reinforces the overall claim of this poem, and of the volume as a whole in a note to this stanza in which he provides a prose equivalent to his poetic strategy, arguing that the cold reports of the newspapers disguise the individual histories of war, in which each statistic: (p.30) “stands for a long pathetic story (which, if told at length, could not fail to bring tears into all eyes) of a dying man, extended on the cold, uncurtained, unpil-lowed, unattended, conch of earth; trampled on, or passed by, with savage neglect, instead of being surrounded with soothing ministers to his final necessities; and encompassed, instead of the silence of the chamber of death, with scenes of tumult and distraction! Who, that contemplated, in the sum of the slain, at the conclusion of a battle, an accumulation of such affecting pictures as this, could read the tragical amount, without a horror that should cause his head to swim, and strike a sickness into his heart?” (11)
As this Hymn suggests, representations of suffering on the battlefield were central to- anti-war poetics, contrary to influential recent arguments that the British, reading public was protected, from the horrors of war by print culture. After all, the Anti-jacobin identified the portrayal of the physical damage of war as one of the central features of Jacobin poetry: ‘we are presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered peasants, and deserted looms’.85 To use the terms of the texts themselves, the war poetry of the period is a poetry of piercing and boring,86 of wounding and bleeding,87 of mangling, shattering, breaking, (p.31)maiming and scarring,88 of agonizing pain and groaning,89 and of dying.90 The ‘horrid scene’ of ‘The Field of Bailie”, strewn with ‘Slaughter’d men and mangled cattle’,91 becomes the crucial site for the representation of war’s damage, whether represented in the poetic diction of the eighteenth century as ‘th’ensanguin’d plain’ and ‘the blood-empurpled plain’, or in the graphic terms used to describe the scene of conflict in January 1795, ‘Belgia’s reeking plain’ where ‘Alternate horrors rise and reign!’92 Rather than, protecting, the British public from the destructive violence of conflict, much of the poetry of the period aimed to make the reader feel war’s pain and suffering; war poetry was more like a paper bullet than a paper shield.

As much recent theoretical work has shown, war is inextricably linked (p.33) to the production, reproduction, and circulation in society of ideas about gender and gender roles.93 It has been argued that, after biological reproduction, war is the activity where the division of labour along gender lines has been the most obvious and where sexual difference has seemed the most absolute and natural

In all these cases the enactment of a specific role demanded by the emergency of war enables women to move beyond what is perceived to be their natural role, a process which can be presented as either only a temporary necessity before the natural role is resumed or a more radical questioning of the construction of such roles. (P. 34)

But for other poets war threatened to overwhelm poetry and to render it irrelevant, an anxiety expressed by Elizabeth Moody in the “Preface’ to her collection of poems of 1798, Poetic Trifles:
I am well aware that this is no period favourable to the Muse.
	•	This is no time for calm, familiar talk,
	•	Like man and maidens in an evening, walk.
	•	War is our business. POPE’S HOMER
At a season, therefore, like the present,—when the monster WAR is sounding his terrific alarms;—when the spirit of discord is in the air, and pervades every Atmosphere,—when it not only stimulates the combatants in the field of battle, but in the field of Literature,—when the fiend POLITICS is sharpening the pen to make it like a two-edged sword; and the Pamphleteer builds his hopes of Celebrity on the basis of Spleen and Acrimony—How I presume to ask, may the compilation of a few harmless Numbers be expected to engage the public attention?106
Here Moody locates, poetry within the context of the ongoing pamphlet war of the 1790s, and suggests the tension between the dominating political concerns of the decade and poetry’s supposed ability to transcend (p.38) such historical crises. While displaying the diffidence required of a woman poet in the later years of this decade (especially in a volume beginning with a poem entitled ‘Thoughts on War and Peace’), Moody’s comments raise a number of the major concerns of this book. How could poetry, ‘a few harmless numbers’, engage the attention of the reading public in wartime? Was there a role for it when confronted with ‘the monster WAR”? If poetry was constructed, as feminized, particularly in its elevated forms, in a period when the nation was demanding manliness-embodied in the active figures of the soldier, the sailor, the volunteer, and even the nation itself, how could poets—be they men or women-speak on international events with authority? And at a time when ‘Literature” itself was becoming defined by the field of battle, what would be the impact on poetry of more than two decades of conflict between Britain and France?107 (p. 37-8)

As mentioned above, it has been estimated that one in four families was directly involved in the wars and like much of the poetry of the 1790s ‘Effects of War’ emphasizes that while war is fought abroad its effects are felt at home. Much of this poetry focused on widows and orphans, calling on their tears and sighs as the ultimate indictment of war» a technique with biblical and classical precedent.114 Already an important figure in the literature of sensibility, the widow was used in numerous poems to represent the cost of conflict  … The widow also became the subject of the writing of some of the most ambitious poets of the decade, including Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, and Robert Southey, whose work will be examined in the next two chapters. These writers made particular use of one of the sub-genres of war poetry in the period, the ‘ruined cottage’ poem which figures war’s impact on the domestic sphere through the image of the increasingly dilapidated building, often a symbol for the widow herself.116 Poets also used the ‘ruined cottage’ form to represent the more general social and economic crisis caused by conflict (p. 40)

Robert Merry’s poem ‘The Wounded Soldier’, written circa 1795 and printed in The Spirit of the Public Journals in 1799, illustrates this fusion of war’s damage to the soldier and to the home in startling fashion (BWP, 242).

Other poems rewrite returning soldier narratives to contain the troubling implications of the figure. One such piece, ‘The Soldier’s Return’, published in the Scat’s Magazine in April 1804, reads like a rewriting of Merry’s ‘The Wounded Soldier’ as a returning soldier worries that his sudden reappearance might produce a similarly fatal effect on his loved ones (p. 43) … ‘The Soldier’s Return’, then, repeatedly invokes the tropes of anti-war poetry only to present them as fictions; the soldier’s injuries are lies and his story ‘feign’d’. Published in the year after the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens and during the period of invasion crisis, ‘The Soldier’s Return’ reclaims an anti-war figure for patriotic purposes, making the returning soldier a figure in a comic narrative of war that ends in marriage rather than the grave. Yet it is a narrative shadowed by its tragic other, in a poem of illusions, the father’s exclamation that he and his wife may ‘escape the grave’ strikes a note of romantic fantasy that emphasizes that it is the soldier’s own escaping of the grave that is the poem’s real illusion. (P. 44)

While the writers of such verse may not really expect their poems to be read by ‘the self-call’d great’ or ‘Monarchs’, they use such figures as a means of illustrating poetry’s potential power on the reader, calling especially on the language and models of sensibility. (P.45)

Published in November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin’s lament predates Nelson’s much celebrated triumph at the battle of the Nile of 1 August 1798, yet even before this ‘glorious victory’ there was no lack of poets keen to sing the actions of British heroes, with the naval victories of Howe over the French on the ‘Glorious First of June’ 1794 and Duncan over the Dutch at Camperdown in 1797 providing popular opportunities. Similarly there did exist a poetic register for overwhelming the ‘horrors of war in its glory’, seen, for example, in a poem by ‘Panormus’ published sixteen months before the declaration of war entitled ‘The Triumphant Warrior’ which celebrates war as a uniting force that provides an opportunity to prove one’s bravery and to gain honour and fame (p.47)

One poet who might have hoped that he filled the Anti-Jacobin’s role of ‘one good and true poet’ was Henry James Pye, appointed Poet Laureate in 1790, whose ‘duteous Muse’ produced two ‘Odes’ each year, one for the New Year and one for the king’s birthday, as well as other occasional pieces to celebrate particular occasions.128 These odes were set to music by the court musician and sung before the king at the state drawing rooms, after which they were widely published.129 (p. 48)

In his non-laureate verse, Pye sought to use poetry to urge the war’s continuation and to inspire his readers’ participation in it, publishing translations of the elegies of the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus in 1795, for example.135Pye’s attempts to inspire martial fervour met with a mixed reception, however, and an amusing account included by T. J. Mathias in a note to the 1796 edition of The Pursuits of Literature illustrates the varying appeal of his poetry to different sections of society. According to this account, ‘[s]everal of the ReviewingGenerals … were much impressed with (the] weight and importance’ of the translations and had them “read aloud at Warley Common and at Barham Downs, by the adjutants, at the head of five different regiments, at each camp, and much was expected. But before they were half finished, all the front ranks, and as many of the others as were within hearing or verse-shot, dropped their arms suddenly, and were all found fast asleep!”136 (p.50) The laureate’s failure to inspire the troops reinforces the Anti-Jacobin’s sense of the lack of ‘One good and true poet’ and suggests the need for a different poetic mode to bolster the war against France, a mode that would be supplied by the metrical romances of Scott, who would become the unofficial laureate and whose poetry was capable of inspiring soldiers even in the arena of conflict.
Over the next few years the Gentleman’s Magazinewould adopt Tasker as their version of the bard whose work was ‘so well calculated to animate loyal Britons against invaders, and to inspire the necessary unanimity and concord’ and was ‘exceedingly well adapted to the present times; since it breathes a threefold spirit of Poetry, Loyalty, and Patriotism’.151 Over a nine-month period from December 1798 to August 1799 it reprinted the ‘Ode to the Warlike Genius of Great Britain’, originally published in 1778, in which Tasker presents the Bards as divinely inspired figures whose role was to ‘Inspire the sons of Mars in dreams, | And fire their souls in warlike themes’.152 But the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott. (P. 53)
A bold claim!!! Is it also possible that a reprinting offers something important that contemporary poetry does not…?

While this opening chapter has looked at a wide range of examples, subsequent chapters will focus more closely on particular writers and texts produced at key moments of crisis or emergency to show how poetry was conceived and employed as a vital form in representing and imagining war and how the conflict with France shaped the self-conceptions of individual poets as well as broader formulations of the function of poetry itself. The next three chapters will look at the issue of the poetic (p.54) role in wartime in the writing of four of the major poets of the opening decade of the conflict, Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. Chapter 2 argues that Smith and Coleridge responded to wartime moments of crisis (the declaration of war and the invasion threat respectively) by making the imagining of the conflict a crucial function of their poetry and a key element of their identities as writers. Chapter 3 examines how Southey and Wordsworth defined their poetic identities in relation to war, war poetry, and each other during the years 1798–1802, while Chapter 4 argues that in his political sonnets of 1802–3, written during the invasion crisis, Wordsworth reconceived his poetic role, and poetry and the nation more generally, as ‘manly’. Chapter 5focuses on Walter Scott, who transformed the poetic imagining of war during the conflict (and for a century to come), shifting the emphasis from war’s horrors to its picturesque excitements in his metrical romances. The influence of this transformation of war is examined in Chapter 6 which examines the way in which the dominant new understanding of the war as romance was deployed and resisted in poems written on the Peninsular War by Felicia Hemans, Lord Byron, and Robert Southey, as well as by Scott himself. The final chapter will look at two poets writing in the decade after Waterloo whose identities were shaped by their sense of themselves as war poets, Byron and Hemans, and argue that looking back on the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars they find in the siege a figure for the total and dominating conflict that defined the age through which they had lived.

Charlotte Smith’s reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, two months after France’s declaration of war on Britain, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the eighteenth century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. Smith begins the poem, with a model of fancy as a delusive power to which women are especially vulnerable, a continuation of her conception of it in Elegiac Sonnets. But. the encounter of her poetic persona with the figures of war in boo-k II forces a reassessment of the poetics of sensibility that had characterized the collection of poems which had made her famous. Moving away from a poetics which finds its metaphors for the self in the suffering other, in The Emigrants Smith presents the victims of war as beyond the limits of suffering known to either her persona or to the British public, all of whom are ‘safe’ from the conflict, ‘by the rude sea guarded’ (II. 210).1 It is through imagining war in poetry, and insisting on the public’s imagining of war, that the poet can bring the war home to the reading public and bring the conflict to an end. In conceiving of the wartime role of the imagination in this way, Smith transforms the function of a faculty that was becoming particularly associated with women (p.56) and constructs her poetic role as specifically feminine, finding her model for the poet in the figure of the mother.

writing five years later in ‘Fears in Solitude’ Samuel Taylor Coleridge addresses, what he sees as a national failure to imagine the war. Like Smith in The Emigrants, in ‘Fears in Solitude’ the poet addresses a nation distant from the scene of conflict—’Secure from actual warfare’ (l. 88)2—and, like her, he ultimately offers his own imagining as a model for the nation. But while Smith represents her imaginative powers through the feminine figure of the mother, the Coleridgean poet is a specifically masculine figure, mature and paternal If in Smith’s text the imagining of conflict will lead to war’s extinction, Coleridge’s poem is driven by an opposition between the poet’s imagining of war and the nation’s failure to do so that threatens, to bring ‘actual warfare’ to Britain. While ‘Fears in Solitude” emphasizes the challenge of war to the poet and war’s role in the development (and remasculinization) of this figure, it also occupies a place as an important document in the evolution of Coleridge’s ideas about the imagination, A text which supports Nigel Leask’s ‘demand of Imagination’ that it occupy ‘a position of accountability in the practical realm’,3 ‘Fears in Solitude” illustrates the political function that Coleridge outlined, for the imagination in much of his writing of the 1790s. Yet in creating an opposition between the ‘imagined’ and the ‘actual’, Coleridge was establishing the framework for his influential post-Waterloo accounts of the imagination, the poet, and the absolute genius which would detach them from the world of “realities’. The imagining of war, then, plays a major role in the development of the romantic imagination. (P. 56)

Smith develops this concern with fancy in book I of The Emigrants, her two-book blank-verse poem which, describes the encounter on the south coast of Britain, of her poetic persona with various religions and aristocratic exiles from revolutionary France, Smith began the poem in 1792,7 three years after the publication of her sonnet, and throughout book I emphasizes the delusive nature of fancy which she associates with women, especially a series of mother figures and her own poetic persona. (P. 58)

It is the demands of war on Smith as a poet that leads her to redeem fancy in book II of The Emigrants and to reconstruct her poetic identity and role’ France declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793 and, by positioning the two books, of The Emigrants either side of this date, Smith emphasizes how the change in historical moment from book I to book II is crucial to her poetic reconceptions. Whereas book I is set on ‘a Morning in November, 1792’ (p. 135), book II is dated ‘an afternoon in April, 1793’ (p-149); and while the events of war that Smith describes in book II are those of the civil war in France of the previous year, 1792—‘The Summer past’’ (II. 213)—as described by the emigrants, it is Britain’s entry into the war that leads to the change of emphasis, No longer a poem about exile, in book. II The Emigrants becomes a poem about war (a shift emphasized by the epigraph from Virgil (p. 149)) and Smith constructs a very different model of the role of fancy in response to this changed context.

In The Emigrants Smith puts her faith in the émigrés’ first-hand accounts of the war to provide the basis for her own and her readers’ imaginings of conflict. Her attachment of detailed prose footnotes to her poetic pictures of the war seeks to further emphasize the accuracy of her text’s representations of the events of summer 1792.13 However, to guarantee the impact of her recounted depictions of war on her readership, Smith frames them through cultural forms that evoke an emotional response enacted by her poetic persona. (P. 63)

Smith’s depictions of ‘savage War’ in these pictures and tales culminate in a daring and powerful denunciation of ‘the closet murderers’ whom we style | Wise Politicians’ (II. 320–1 ) and the polemical nature of her poem is suggested by her use of the phrase ‘plunder’d peasants’ in her description of the pictures of war (II. 229). When in 1797 the Anti-Jacobin outlined the favoured topics of Jacobin poetry, it commented that ‘we are presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered peasants, and deserted looms’.15 While the Anti-jacobin may not have had The Emigrants specifically in its sights here (though I have not found the phrase elsewhere), its use of the phrase does locate Smithes text within a political poetics that the periodical sought to counter and which it strikingly sees as characterized by its emphasis on the physical damage of war. (P 64)

While Smith’s quotation from Gray’s ‘Elegy’ emphasizes both her poetic-identity and the- role of sensibility in her work, she here insists on sensibility being directed away from ‘selfish sufferings’.16  (p. 65)

But. six months after she-had completed The Emigrants, the nature of her relation with the war would again change, and with it her sense of the authority of her poetic role, For on 6 September 1793 her seventh, son Charles, an. ensign in the Bedfordshires, was wounded during the Duke of York’s campaign on the borders of France and Holland.17 (p. 66)

‘Written in. April 1798, During the Alarm of an Invasion’, as its subtitle announces, ‘Fears in Solitude’ has long been regarded as one of the (p.68) crucial accounts of Coleridge’s shifting response to the war with France, with the strident anti-war poet, lecturer, and journalist of the mid-ijgos seeking to realign his political position as a result of international developments, especially the French occupation of Switzerland in early 1798, itself the subject of Coleridge’s ‘The Recantation: An Ode’, published in the same quarto pamphlet by Joseph Johnson.22 Yet while a poem of political crisis on both international and personal levels’ ‘Fears in Solitude’ is also a poem which presents the threat of invasion as at least in part the product of a poetic crisis, and. specifically a national failure of imagination and feeling. Like Charlotte Smith, Coleridge identifies the separation of the British public from the scene of war as crucial to their response to it (p. 67-8)

As Coleridge argued in a piece entitled ‘Insensibility of the Public Temper’ in the Morning Post in February 1798, the familiarity of European, events to the reading public meant that their impact on the imagination had lessened: ‘What is familiar to the imagination ceases to-be terrible; and what ceases to be terrible we no longer feel a strong inducement to resist’ (EoT, I. 22), (p 69)

The euphemistic language of war has become detached from what. Coleridge elsewhere terms ‘realities’, realities registered here through the physical damage to the soldier’s body, the emotional response of the widow (a variation of a figure previously used in ‘On the Present War’ and ‘Religious Musings’)25 and through divine Judgement. (P. 70)

Like Smith, Coleridge imagines war through the figure of the fleeing widow and baby, but whereas for Smith such a. scene was unimaginable in Britain, in 1793, except as an. imagining, for Coleridge the feared invasion threatens to turn a literary trope into a reality in his native isle. (P. 73)

Writing in the 1790s, Charlotte Smith and Samuel Taylor Coleridge both offer the imaginative poet as a model for the nation’s response to war, and their detailed poetic examinations of the functions and effects of the imagination reveal the extent to which they saw this faculty as having an essentially political function, contrary to influential accounts of the imagination which see it as transcending, compensating for, or displacing, the political.38 Yet paradoxically ‘Fears in Solitude’ can also (p.78) be seen as a text which begins the detaching of the imaginative from the political on which such later accounts are built For while Coleridge could appeal to the nation’s ‘truth-painting Imagination’ in his 1795 slave-trade lecture, ‘Fears in Solitude’ distinguishes between the poet’s imagining of the war and the nation’s failure to do so. The poem differentiates the poet from the rest of the nation and establishes an imaginary world created by him and peopled by the creatures of his imagination

Coleridge’s definition of the faculties of the poet remain much the same as in the 1790s, but if in that decade feeling and imagination were the base of his politics, twenty years later they have become entirely separate from it. While the poet’s imagination (or ‘fancy’, as it is now) continues to paint, it is no longer ‘truth-painting’ and its images would no longer be confirmed by the fleshly eye; indeed the very power of the poetry is proof of the lack of observation of war. Rather than the poem having its origin in ‘realities’, it is the poet and his ‘seething imagination’ who becomes its source, in an anticipation of Abrams’s expressive model of romantic poetry.43 In this ‘Preface’, Coleridge completes one of the major transformations of the imagination in the romantic period, but even while seeking to discredit and disclaim his earlier construction of his poetic identity, his account, emphasizes the extent to which his highly influential ideas about poetry and imagination were formulated in relation to the era of war in which, he lived. (P.79)

———

IN ROBERT SOUTHEY’S blank-verse poem ‘History’, written between mid-1798 and early 1799, the poet asks himself the repeated, question ‘Was it for this …?’1 Examining the development of his ‘young mind’ and ‘swelling heart’ and his aspirations to ‘love | his fellow kind’, the troubled writer finds himself confronted by the ‘crimes’ of history and calls on ‘gentle Poesy’ to receive him from, scenes such as ‘the fields of war’ so that he may ‘nurse | My nature’s, better feelings, for my soul | Sickens at man’s misdeeds’ (II. 1–8). This familiar narrative of an overwhelming sense of personal and political crisis producing a turn away from ‘History’, often figured as here as a retreat to a bower, has been a major feature of accounts of canonical romanticism, and still holds considerable sway. (P. 80)

It seems likely that Southey and Wordsworth drew on the same sources in Ariosto, Milton, Thomson, and Pope for the phrase “Was it for this …?’ but less certain is whether either knew of the other’s use of it in their contemporaneous explorations of poetic identity. (P. 81)

Wordsworth was probably the first to use the formula, beginning his first draft of The Prelude with the phrase in October 1798 in Goslar.5 Southey’s poem was published in January 1799 and the evidence of his Common-Place Book suggests it was written shortly before this, though in later editions he dated it to Westbury 1798, which would mean it could have been written any time after June 1798.6 At 31 lines to The Prelude’s eventual 8,000, ‘History’ may seem more like a reductio ad absurdum of Wordsworth’s epic than a genuine answer to it, but it does offer a manifesto for a different poetic mode to the one normally defined as romantic, one that is politically committed and speaks with what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ’the calm, collected public voice’.7 (p. 82)

If Southey’s poem opens by establishing an opposition between two kinds of writing’History’s ‘Chronicle’ and the strains of ‘poesy’, only to collapse that distinction in his own historically inspired song, this opening opposition invokes and parodies the way poetry was often feminized in the writing of the 1790s as a trembling or timid Muse who turns away from the subject of ‘war, horrid war’, seeking like the poet of ‘History’ the shelter of the bower, removed from ‘the court’s polluted scenes, … dungeon horrors, … [and] … the fields of war’ (II 4–5). This chapter will examine the way in which Southey and Wordsworth responded to the war in their poetry and show how the war played a major role in the shaping of their poetic identities. (P. 82)

These developments in Wordsworth’s writing, particularly as they affected the relationship between his poetic role and his response to the figures of war, can be examined through a discussion of one of his encounters with history in ‘The Discharged Soldier’, a blank-verse fragment describing an incident that probably took place in 1788 and that Wordsworth would later include in book IV of The Prelude.26 Written in 1798, the year Southey’s encounter with history in the form of Clio prompted his poetic rededkation, Wordsworth’s encounter also produced a moment of poetic dedication, but one in which ‘History’ remains an other that troubles the poet’s sense of vocation. Wordsworth represents the experience of war through encounter and tale-telling, as his wandering poetic persona, on turning a corner, finds ‘Presented to my view an uncouth shape’, who he later sees is ‘clad in military garb’ (II. 38, 54).27 Like the figures of war in Wordsworth’s earlier poetry and like the many returning soldiers of the newspaper and magazine poetry discussed, in the opening chapter, the soldier tells his tale:
	•	when erelong
	•	I asked his history, he in reply
	•	Was neither slow nor eager, but unmoved,
	•	And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,
	•	A stalely air of mild indifference,
	•	He told a simple fact: that he had been
	•	A Soldier, to the tropic isles had gone,
	•	Whence he had landed now some ten days past;
	•	That on hts landing he had been dismissed,
	•	And with the little strength he yet had left
	•	Was travelling to regain his native home.   (II. 94–104)

(p.89) The soldier’s history is a familiar one, and Toby R. Benis has given, a powerfully contextualized reading of the poem as one that ‘criticizes Britain’s leaders’. seeing the soldier as a figure ‘whose sickly condition and wanderings are direct products of government policy and military service’.28 Yet in the context of the newspaper and magazine verse on wounded and returning soldiers, what is striking in Wordsworth’s presentation of the soldier’s telling of his tale is its lack of political and polemical force and its failure to produce the conventional poetic responses of sympathy or indignation on the part of the poet, In its attack on the Jacobin Poet in the second issue of 27 November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin had criticized the political use of sensibility ‘by-many authors … in sonnets and elegies without end’, giving an outline of the standard poetic techniques used by the writers of such verse:
A human being, in the lowest state of penury and distress, is a treasure to a reasoner of this cast. He contemplates, he examines, he turns him in every possible light, with, a view of extracting from the variety of his wretchedness new topics of invective against the pride of property. He indeed (if he is a true Jacobin), refrains from relieving the object of his compassionate contemplation; as well knowing, that every diminution from the general mass of human misery, must proportionally diminish the force of his argument29

In his treatment of the discharged soldier, it is as if the Wordsworthian narrator is responding to this attack, recommending that he accompany the soldier to the dwelling of a labourer who ‘will give you food if food you need, | And lodging for the night’ (II. 114–15). And reinforcing the soldier’s failure to fulfil the polemical and emotive role that would be allotted to him in political poetry, the poet again questions him about his ‘history’, this time providing him with a veritable checklist of the radical agenda of anti-war poetry:
	•	While thus we travelled on I did not fail
	•	To question him of what he had endured
	•	From, war and battle and the pestilence.   (II. 137–9)

But again the soldier’s answer fails to produce the ‘topics of invective’ we have seen in other treatments of the figure: (p.90)
	•	He all the while was in demeanor calm,
	•	Concise in answer: solemn and sublime
	•	He might have seemed, but that in all he said
	•	There was a strange half-absence and a tone
	•	Of weakness and indifference, as of one
	•	Remembering the importance of his theme,
	•	But feeling it no longer.   (II. 140–6)

The soldier’s delivery of his tale, like the fact that ‘He appeared | To travel without pain’ (II. 122–3), undermines the poet’s expectation that he would encounter one of the physically damaged victims of war, akin to Robert Merry’s ‘The Wounded Soldier’, discussed in Chapter 1. The normal ‘feeling’ response to tales of war is blocked by the poet’s sense that the soldier himself no longer ‘feels’ the importance of his theme and rather than producing expressions of just indignation against contending governments the encounter leads only to silence (II. 149).

Southey’s and Wordsworth’s poetic, encounters with ‘History’ in 1798, in the forms of Clio and the discharged soldier, exemplify the developments (p.92) of their poetic identities, evolving out of and continuing to inform their treatment of the figures of war. Their different trajectories as poets and their contrasting poetic responses to the war can be traced through their poetic dialogue over the next few years. While Southey reviewed Lyrical Ballads for the Critical Review in 1798, mo-re revealing of his response to the collection and to Wordsworth’s poetry of the late 1790s in general were the many poems he wrote in 1798 and 1799 which directly echo and rewrite Wordsworth’s published and unpublished poetry of the period.35 As Mary Jacobus has argued, these borrowings should not be seen as plagiarism but as ‘a deliberate attempt [by Southey] to put right what he had criticized in his review’, restoring the Ballads to the context from which they had been taken, replacing what Jacobus terms their new sophistication, oddity, arnbitiousness, imagination, universality, and symbolism with topicality, simplicity, and familiarity.36 Developing Jacobus’s argument, I think Southey’s rewritings of Lyrical Ballads counters what I have been arguing is one of the fundamental manœuvres that characterizes the development of Wordsworthian romanticism, the shift from a polemical humanitarian concern with suffering individuals to a psychological interest in their state of mind. Instead, Southey writes history back into Lyrical Ballads. (P. 91-2)

Wordsworth had himself subscribed to the fifth edition, of Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets of 178937 and ironically, given his failure to acknowledge her influence over his own sonnets in the account of 1843, he described Smith in 1835 as ‘a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered’.38 (p. 108)

——

Epilogue:

ADAM FERGUSON’S READING of The Lady of the Lake to ‘the rough sons of the Fighting Third Division’, with which this book began, and Felicia Hernam’s poetic imagining of war in response to the ‘magic page’ of The Talisman, with which it has ended, illustrate the centrality of Walter Scott’s writing to the envisioning of conflict during the romantic period. While the popularity of Scott’s metrical romances was superseded by the phenomenal sales of Byron’s poetry and his own success as a novelist in the years after the war, his reimagining of war remained tremendously influential throughout the nineteenth century, playing a major role in the chivalric revival, in the elevation of the warrior to heroic status, and in the romanticization of war that Michael Paris has seen as defining the ‘warrior nation’ from 1850 to 2000.1 For example, Scott’s description of the battle of Flodden in Marmion continued to be regarded by many as the greatest ever battle poem throughout the nineteenth century. In 1833, W. B. O. Peabody described the ‘glorious battle scene’ as ‘one of the finest passages of narrative poetry in the language’,2 while in the 1880s John Ruskin assessed it as ‘the truest and grandest battle-piece that, so far as I know, exists in the whole compass of literature’, adding in a note: ‘I include the literature of all foreign languages, so far as known to me: there is nothing to approach the finished delineations and flawless majesty of conduct in Scott’s Flodden’.3 Indeed, (p.226) Marmion became the benchmark for assessing all poetic accounts of war. Thomas Hardy once responded to criticism of Homer’s Iliad, Oh, but I admire the Iliad greatly. Why, it’s in the Marmion class!’4
The continued influence of Scott’s poetry on the imagining of conflict can be felt in verses written at the opening of the First World War» such as Julian Grenfell’s ‘Into Battle’ with its emphasis on ‘the joy of battle’ and Herbert Asquith’s ‘The Volunteer’ with its portrayal of a clerk fearing that ‘his days would drift away | With no lance broken in life’s tournament’,5 And the attacks of the poets of that war on the idealization of conflict were in part a response to a verse tradition, as well as a broader cultural movement, that can be traced back to Scott. For example, when Siegfried Sassoon condemns the conception of the war as romance in ‘Glory of Women’—’you believe | That chivalry redeems the war’s disgrace’6—he does so by invoking and undermining a typically chivalric moment in The Lord of the Isles when the King sends his cavalry into battle:
	•	‘Forward, each gentleman and knight!
	•	Let gentle blood show generous might,
	•	And chivalry redeem the fight!’ (VI. 24)

And Scott’s influential transformation of the imagining of war was not limited to Great Britain. In Life on the Mississippi (1883), Mark Twain diagnosed the ‘Sir Walter disease’ which infected the Southern states of America prior to the American Civil War through Scott’s creation of a ‘Middle-Age sham civilization’ (while Twain’s particular target is the novel Ivanhoe, his account of Scott refers equally to the poetry).7 The ‘Sir Walter disease’ attacked the imaginative self-conception of Scott’s readers» turning many of them into warriors (as the Eclectic Review argued Scott’s poetry had done to his British readers). Twain writes that ‘It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major or a Colonel, or a General or a Judge, before the war’ (469) and that ‘Sir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the war, (p.227) that he is in great measure responsible for the war’ (469). While Twain qualifies this argument by describing it as a ‘wild proposition’, it remains one for which ‘something of a plausible argument might» perhaps» be made’ (469). And Twain concludes by restating his argument, commenting that ‘The change of Character [responsible for the war] can be traced rather more easily to Sir Walter’s influence than to that of any other thing or person’ (469). Scott’s influence was such» Twain argues, that he can be held responsible for the American Civil War. While Twain symbolically enacted the end of Scott’s influence in Huckleberry Finnwhen he named the wrecked steamboat the Walter Scoff»8 it was the First World War which marked the culmination and the conclusion of the cult of chivalry and of Scott’s century of influence. But to borrow the formula of Twain’s ‘wild proposition’, in his poetry Scott transformed the writing of conflict during the Napoleonic wars and it is to the influence of Walter Scott» more than to that of any other thing or person» that we can trace the changed imagining of war in the nineteenth century.

            <Text>Plan of Study
A recent article by Kathleen Bode calling for a “data-rich literary history” exemplifies a current shift in digital humanities research. Bode critiques pioneers of distant reading and literary macroanalysis Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they use as proof of their arguments. As an alternative, Bode calls for an integration of computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799, to redefine our understanding of the definitive works of this decade.
Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 titles published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. The 1790s saw the emergence of popular novels, Romantic poetry, and radical political philosophy. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole, and a selective literary canon began to take form.
My dissertation consists of two major experiments. The first experiment centres on the books and booklets (which I collectively term “titles”) printed during this decade, to identify which titles are most popular by mutiple metrics, and to challenge past oversimplifications of popularity. I write my own small computer programs to combine the 1790s holdings of twenty databases. Because these programs do not need to be fully developed into software for general use, I can write them quickly and independently. I will compare which titles appear in which archives, identify reprints, and use topic modelling to categorize their general contents. This work will allow me to identify material (such as sermons) that has been systematically excluded from specialized digital archives, revealing how these archives re-inscribe a literary canon. This phase of the project has completed data collection and begun experimentation; analysis will be complete by March 2019.
The OGS would therefore primarily fund the second experiment, which will occupy the fifth year of my five-year PhD program. This experiment turns from texts to their makers, undertaking a comprehensive mapping focused on persons, rather than titles. In addition to distinguishing between ‘high’ and ‘low’ literary content, the 1790s saw a distinction between ‘mainstream’ and ‘marginal’ (usually politically radical) writers and publishers. However, the nature of the radicals’ marginalization is in question. Building off of existing resources like the British Book Trade Index database and Linked Open Data frameworks, I will create a network graph of all authors, publishers, and printers operating in England 1789 to 1799. The primary technical challenge to this project, as in the first project, will be rendering existing data interoperable; I will again write small programs to adapt and manipulate this data until it is possible to visualize the social network underlying a decade of print production. I will then examine this social network to see if it does, indeed, display a distinct ‘mainstream’. The graph may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, I will analyse the shape the network ultimately displays, to either reaffirm or redefine our understanding of eighteenth century radical print culture.
The project as a whole builds off of scholarship in both the digital humanities and bibliography, providing missing links between disparate fragments of information. By correlating this information, I can revise our understanding of the most popular works during a volatile decade of literary history, and establish a methodology for future computational work.

            <Text>Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99

My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise …  
TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters – or can you?
TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.</Comments>

            <Title>David Brewer abstract</Title>
            <Text>The recent quantitative turn in literary studies has reminded us of the breadth and variety of the literary field of the past. In so doing, however, it has necessarily levelled out the felt distinctions between various texts, and so risks working against the very sort of literary history that its new vistas promise: one which does justice to the workings of form across time and space. In particular, the presumptive interchangeability of texts that is required to put them into a series susceptible to quantitative analysis ignores the massively different footprint left by commercially successful (and socially canonical) texts as we move beyond their moment of initial publication. Evelina, for example, may have been just another novel of 1778 when it first appeared, but it loomed far above all other productions of that year a decade later (or anywhere beyond the metropole). Such footprints, I argue, changed the significance of their texts’ form, making it seem richer, thicker, more resonant or definitive—perhaps, for some, more stifling or oppressive—than that of their apparently similar but less successful counterparts.</Text>

            <Text>My reading has allowed me to develop more specific hypotheses regarding potential chapters. 

are all my chapters going to be “compare two authors and how they use one genre”?
are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?
if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format (though I could add people who wrote plays!!)
and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?
or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More &amp; Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”
and that’s the one where I talk about my emerging theory of timeliness
or is timeliness not a chapter, but in fact the overarching theme of the whole diss?</Text>

            <Title>Coleridge wrote "We Are Seven"</Title>
            <Text>“My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-'A little child, dear brother Jim,' —I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jim.” (WW)

And it’s even an IN JOKE, and he uses the stanza just as Coleridge wrote it, deleting the joke without replacing it with anything!! This is not transcendent inspiration and individual genius. (He had long left behind the mountain and the girl when he wrote; he was thinking about tea time!)

— It is perfectly fine to be thinking about tea time; the poem is still wonderful. But the myth simply doesn’t work.</Text>

This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expand- ing audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3 </Text>

            <Text>The poetry certainly circulated outside its novelistic content -- in the case of Udolpho, two of the main character's poems were actually published separately in periodicals beforethe novel. But the songs and poems included in novels seem to be there in part to "elevate" and grant respectability to the fiction -- Udolpho mentions a ballad, but doesn't print it. So perhaps the somewhat disreputable nature of popular ballads could be tempered by literary or moral intervention, but only when that was the only literary project going.

            <Text>Is there a way in which this can be said to be, overall, about how texts do or don't 'enter' a 'canon' of writings - by which you mean, as per e.g. Guillory or Bourdieu, and the idea of cultural capital, a set of texts studied, produced, valued (to varying degrees over time) within certain cultural fields, most especially the field of academic research (but also education, modern publishing, creative industries etc). And then your contribution to the many discussions that go on about (and indeed change) canon, is to bring show we can use digital tools to ask and answer that question? I think maybe it is, and if that is the case, then you need to say just that, and that the other issues - timelessness, popularity, marginalization, immediacy, fall out of that larger question… If you frame it like this, and I think I am suggesting you should, it will force you to have a preliminary chapter or part of the introduction where you review terms/concepts like ‘popularity’ or indeed, canon, or ‘marginalization’ - all of which have their own literatures, outside of DH, but also sometimes in or adjacent it (see e.g. the arguments of Lesser, Farmer, Blayney about Shx’s popularity as measured by edition output and print runs - which used some very basic data tools). You need this because at the moment, you just jump into the studies without the framing questions well established. Such a chapter/intro would also enable you to deal directly with the way that other researchers in your fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address these questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading. 

This initial chapter/introduction  I am imagining would also deal with “why 1790s literature” and who else treats the 1790s as a period worthy of cordoning off like this (thus, who your scholarly interlocutors are). 

Finally, you’ve not tried to articulate the queer theory piece here. I think you should, perhaps by thinking with something like this… https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/406/406.pdf. What would be the special character of a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. </Text>

            <Text>Alan Liu, _Wordsworth: The Sense of History_: this is an extraordinary, although quite difficult book. On its surface, it's a New Historicist account of Wordsworth's poetry. However, I've learned more about aesthetics in general from this book than from most other Romanticist criticism. (For one of many, many examples in this book, see Liu's brilliant discussion of "atmosphere" in landscape painting and poetry from essentially the Middle Ages to Wordsworth in his chapter on Wordsworth and the picturesque--in a few brief pages, one gets an incredibly helpful art history account that also illuminates Wordsworth's poetry)</Text>

“Kirwan praises Ward Elliot and Robert Valenza’s “call for acknowledgement of uncertainty (a productive agnosticism rather than a reactionary atheism or unquestioning faith),” concluding the section with the dictum that “critics should be as willing to lose Shakespeare as to find him””
“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””
“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha. In so doing, Kirwan proposes to continue destabilizing the monolithic “Shakespeare,” a project he traces back two decades.”
“a startlingly diffuse, unexpectedly consistent corpus of plays linked by company ownership, rather than by what he argues is the anachronism of authorial ownership.
Motivated to trouble “post-Romantic ideals of individual authorship””
“Boldly, he offers agnosticism to replace the “did-didn’t binary.” This yields “the possibility of Shakespeare’s contribution” to Locrine (137) or a proposed differentiation between “Shakespearean” and “by Shakespeare” (161). This third chapter may inflame more controversy than anything else in the book.”
“the field of attribution studies desperately needs critical metacognitive appraisals of its methods, its successes, and its failures. Kirwan’s assessment of and engagement with attribution studies ought to be cited for years to come”
“Having proven the constructedness of “Canon” and “Apocrypha,” having demonstrated the viability of collaboratively created drama, and having questioned the use and availability of “certain” attributions, Kirwan performs his crowning disruption—to “redefine the meanings of both ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘complete’ in a bid to offer multiple configurations of canon” (205). Here and throughout, Kirwan affirms canons, not a Canon.”
“Kirwan’s final chapter models alternative canon-writing practices as evidence of the potentiality of multivalent canons “to provide options instead of answers” dependent upon audiences’ critical participation”</Text>

            <Text>Introduction:

“This study will examine both the spectacle and the forces that shaped it. Examples of performance, drama and theatrical innovation will illustrate how public entertainment responded to the turbulence in the intellectual climate that sociopolitical changes induced, for, even though London did not suffer the traumas of Paris, it underwent a major cultural crisis.” (1)

p.2: When artists can no longer represent the world in coherent patterns, the recognition of which engenders in the viewer a sense of identi®cation and reassurance with the familiar, they may resort to the use of metaphor. They may rework experience into weird and intriguing patterns that distance the audience from reality -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018

Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery, all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all ± mainpieces, comic or tragic; afterpieces, satirical, farcical, musical or spectacular; interludes of music, song and dance; the wit of prologue and epilogue and above all the attractions of the performers, all received plaudits from all corners of the house. Critics might make sharp comparisons, but little of the programme was dismissed as `trash', or `immoral', or irrelevant `fancy'. (3)
p.3: Disagreement as to what is trash and what is treasure suggests cultural crisis, when values are put under question by social stress or political con ̄ict. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.4: those on the `lower' margins of society had not yet found a distinctive voice; their discontent found safe and symbolic expression in rowdy games and festive sports -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.5: in the 1790s individual voices became shriller and their ideas more persuasive to a different section of the population, thus contributing to social fragmentation and creating what today we call `identity politics'. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.6: Politicians, philosophers and economists may have to hammer out rational interpretations of the seeming chaos of material reality, but for artists, and, more particularly, for their bewildered audiences, the naturalistic depiction of probability can seem inadequate. Only an evocation of the barely possible provides a satisfying response to the contradictions of a world which `self-evident' principles can no longer explain.

p.6: When analysing the statistics gathered for his invaluable work, Theatre, Opera, and Audiences in Revolutionary Paris, Emmet Kennedy argues that previous historians overstated the political content and in ̄uence of the theatre during the Revolution.U -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.6: although `uncommitted' plays far outnumbered those dealing with speci®cally political issues, his analyses of changes in emphasis and attitude show that the impact of events on theatrical taste was crucial ± though indirect. Historians can fall into the same trap as political censors in trying to identify topics, stories and speeches that speci®cally refer to issues of the day, because the relationship is usually more subtle than speci®c precisely because it is unintentional. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
For instance, Pierre Desforges' Le Sourd, ou L'Auberge Pleine was the most popular French play of the period (1789±99), a comedy in which a man pretends to be deaf in order to gain accommodation in a crowded inn. Kennedy accurately summarises the plot and its (p. 7) reliance on conventional tropes and situations: `Stock eighteenth- century themes are skilfully exploited here: marriage of love over marriage of interest, bourgeois frugality and prudence over aristo- cratic honour, testy master-servant relations in which money is the main factor, and the psychology of deaf-mutes . . . It has no political message, only a few social banalities.'V At ®rst glance it does seem very traditional, and, no doubt, contemporary audiences read little into it. But all these `stock themes' have implications in identifying the political sympathies of the audience, and some of the new situations or jokes had a more than stock resonance in the context of its ®rst performance in 1790 ± the legitimate travellers' room and the host's chair at table are `usurped' by an outsider pretending to be deaf. Did the revolutionaries of 1790 seem `deaf to reality'? Or just the provincial ones travelling to Paris? If their policies were a trick, should we admire their cunning or their effrontery? The play posed no such political questions directly of its audience, but its very popularity raises them for the cultural analysts. My own curiosity is raised particularly by the metaphor of deafness being adopted as a strategy for coping with a material problem ± particularly as the number of dramatic characters who are deaf, mute or blind steadily increased during the period under investigation. 

p.8: My own method is fundamentally rooted in principles of historical materialism, which continually raise the question of in whose interest events take place, and look for the ways in which material conditions in ̄uence ideological explanations. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.8: When discussing theatrical production my focus will not always be on the most in ̄uential aspects of political or social change, but on how the apparently trivial minutiae of the entertainment business re ̄ected ideological attitudes that were being determined elsewhere on the wide stage of the world. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.9: However, whilst attracted by the oblique perspective of New Historicism, I will continually look to the ultimate shift in material power between social classes to explain the twists and turns of apparent contingency. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.11: My study, of course, intends to explore the very speci®c cultural force of theatre production and how it was involved in `carrying through the transformation'.  -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.14: As shall be seen, throughout this period of cultural crisis, the popular theatre embodied and re ̄ected in many forms not only the material concerns but also many of the wider, less tangible, anxieties of its audiences. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018

Ch 1: lots of references to what is and is not “popular”, with no indication of how he determined them
Notes don’t include any real details on how popularity is determined

Conclusion
p.221: I have, however, argued in some detail that the determiningfeature of the period for the theatre was the sense of loss, a feelingthat things had changed in ways that people did not expect or want,and that theatrical formulations re ̄ected this in images of incarcera-tion, dislocation and supernatural intervention. Plays looked back-wards to the past in order to make sense of the present and future.That past provided contradictory settings ± cruel fortresses of feudalpower and innocent family homes in rural villages. Homes andsecurity that were continually threatened, but, in dreamlike happy (222) endings, were saved by heroic acts of restoration. But in real life,con ̄ict and change were not resolved so neatly. If traditional powerswere restored they were reconstructed in the process, and, when thereconstructions were as thorough as Napoleon's reinvention ofautocracy, the factory owner's dispossession of the peripatetic clo-thier, or Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian reformulation of Enlighten-ment benevolence, then the oppression seemed worse as it hadbecome more ef®cient. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.224: These details of theatre administration and ®nancial policy con®rm my conviction that capitalism or, as it was then termed, political economy was the one ideology to emerge more con®dent than before from the intellectual turmoil engendered by the Revolution. What Adam Smith called the `invisible hand' of economic competition was becoming visible. Classical economists and their political equivalents, the Benthamite Utilitarians, began to claim that the market was the only realistic force that could bene®t good, and drive out bad, practice ± not only in commerce, but in all organisations, civic, cultural and even charitable. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.225: The signi®cance of relating these ®nal years is that Godwin encouraged the young Hazlitt to complete Holcroft's un®nished autobiography.W Although Hazlitt probably considered the task a piece of hack work, the book's existence indicates a direct link between pre-Revolutionary radicalism, as professed by Holcroft, and the post-1815 radicalism associated with a new generation of rationalists that included not only Hazlitt but Francis Place and Robert Owen. Holcroft, a self-educated man, never let persecution or disappointment in the course of events undermine his belief that simple honesty could ®nd rational solutions to political problems. In that he was probably the most consistent of those who greeted the dawn of 1789. For many of the so-called Romantics the Terror of 1793, the emergence of Napoleon's personal dictatorship and cultural triumph of bourgeois vulgarity led them to adopt a state of social isolation and intellectual denial. The new radicalism of the 1820s replaced both Holcroft's simple faith in the benevolence of man and the Romantic obsession with individual identity with a new critique of property. Owen called it Socialism. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018</Text>

            <Title>literary celebrity can inhibit legacy</Title>
            <Text>I… think I am actually interested in the role of “celebrity” as related to authors, and the observation that too much / the wrong kind of celebrity during an author’s lifetime counteracts the potential for long-lasting literary fame
though, Radcliffe was also like Austen quite reclusive and resistant to the “celebrity author” role, even after she achieved financial literary success
but, that just meant that salacious stories of her Gothic madness &amp; death circulated unchallenged after she stopped writing and scholars are still trying to figure out what really did happen to her
hmm-- it ties into my general interest of trying to pick my way through my decade of choice, trying on a range of different metrics for “important” and then paying attention to the bodies of texts that come forward as “important” for each metric
and my diss authors (other than Radcliffe) are all attempting to use and cultivate literary fame as one of the ends of their writing
(well, even Radcliffe is cultivating fame, but with less directly political ends)
I picked authors who wrote prolifically in a range of mediums and genres because I am interested in the emerging “reading public” and what it looked like in the 1790s when all that writing and reading got very high-stakes</Text>

            <Text>historian John Barrell’s Imagining the King’s Death (2000). This is a massive and complex book, again written from a Marxist perspective, focussing on the period from the French regicide in 1793 to the British treason trials of 1794–95.It investigates how agents of the British state sought to make the act of imagining the King’s death a treasonable offence. Their argument was that thinking and writing about revolution would promote it, and revolutions, as the French example showed, killed kings. Many (including the juries who tried those arrested for ‘thoughtcrimes’ like these) could not agree, but Barrell shows how both conservatives and radicals engaged with the argument about the political power of imagination. </Text>

            <Title>closeness / interest</Title>
            <Text>Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistance. Felski describes this as “a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance -- a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments.” As a scholarly practice to demonstrate this closeness, Felski gestures towards what she terms “neophenomenology,” “a sustained attention to the sheer range and complexity of aesthetic experiences, including moments of recognition, enchantment, shock, and knowledge.” Felski has begun this work by establishing a greater richness for the vocabulary of “identifying” with characters. Determining whether a character is “relatable” enough to “identify with” is often a key concern for undergraduate readers and for 18thC thinkers: Felski distinguishes literary itentification into at least three types, “structural or formal alignment, moral allegiance, and emotional empathy,” which could be useful for untangling the allegiance required of different works of sentimental literature. Felski thus begins to locate “post-critical, rather than uncritical” forms of “serious thinking” which could both shed light on and be modified by eighteenth-century practices.</Text>

            <Title>ESTC wordcloud: titles want to tell provenance</Title>
            <Text>What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:
#
By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!
This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.
Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:
	•	A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
	•	The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &amp;c. In three volumes
	•	A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P
There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017

p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017

p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017

p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: the -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: erage date of composition of the first is 1757 and the second is 1775. These results suggest that the language of aesthetic compositionexperiences a substantive change within the eighteenth century and, moreover, give us a chronological outline through which we can begin to -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: pinpoint these transformations -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  these chronological limits coincide with the beginnings of the radical increase in -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017

p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017

p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017

p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017

p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: hmm -- I've been trying to resist my impulses toward tidy clustering; sometimes text are outliers, and a long tail is to be expected.. not everything reduces down to a few categories -- Written May 2, 2017

            <Title>reparative &gt; timeliness transition</Title>
            <Text>The goal of this serious thinking, for Felski, is to remind us “that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized” — a discovery which will “shock” us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite to understant that future ways of life will also be organized differently. For Sedgwick, too, the possibility of “surprise” in a non-paranoid reading, the idea that even the most predictable past events could have unfolded differently, is crucial for imagining change in the future. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing aftershocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that “our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices” are not universal and invulnerable. Robert Miles is one of many to describe the impact of the French Revolution as centred less on individual events, and more on the alarming “historical rupture” which the revolution was seen to constitute. For many, this rupture represented an opportunity for optimism — but many more experienced the turmoil as near-apocalyptic, and even for optimists the sense of impending change was often uncomfortable. Miles argues that a widespread sense of profound change shaped far more than just political thought: “The sense of crisis … linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.” One way that these works were shaped by their context is a heightened sense of timeliness for published works.</Text>

Ch 1:

For example, the broadsheet ballad ‘Millions be Free: A New Song, Tune—“To Anacreon in Heaven”’, part of the Bodleian ballad collection, was also printed in a less radical version as ‘An Ode on the Restoration, of Freedom to France’ in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in January 1793.30 The broadsheet version of this poem, ‘Millions be Free’, written in the context of the French decree of November 1792 offering ‘fraternity and assistance to all peoples who seek to recover their liberty’31 concludes each stanza by looking forward to the spread of revolutionary ideology with a variant of the couplet—‘While FRANCE rises up, and proclaims the DECREE, | That tears off our Chains, and bids MILLIONS BE FREE’. The ‘Ode’ ends each stanza with ‘That tears off their our chains, and bids millions be free’ (emphasis added), which like its title (‘An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France’) and certain subtle but significant changes in tenses, allows the poem to be read as a celebration of the Revolution in France without the broadsheet’s call for the future spread of revolutionary freedom, The ‘Ode’ version illustrates Michael Scrivener’s argument that ambiguity was a necessary feature of much of the radical verse published in newspapers and magazines, enabling a text to satisfy different factions or ‘sides’ (PR.28–9), whereas the anonymous broadsheet version was able to present a more direct and extreme message. As this suggests, texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration (PR 26). Much war poetry of the period has this dual status; many songs written for a specific occasion were republished in the poetry sections of newspapers and magazines, while new sets of words were published in the hope they would be adopted for such purposes or with the aim that the tune to which they were set would heighten their impact on the reader.32 (p. 10)

The interrelation of the two forms is well illustrated by the republication in the government-controlled newspaper The Star in December 1793 of David Garrick’s two (p.13) inscriptions written to accompany William Hogarth’s pair of prints, The Invasion39 These prints had been published in March 1756, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years War with France, and Garrick’s verses read like a collection, of the clichés of French and English national identity (p. 12-3)

The continued power of ‘The Dram’ during the wars is illustrated by the pro-war, patriotic parody of it. beginning ‘I love that drum’s inspiring sound’, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1804 (BWP 330). Like its republication of ‘The Drum’, the Cambridge Intelligencer’s publication of a sixteen-line extract from a poem by Bielby Porteous, who became Bishop of London in 1787, written when he was a student at Cambridge in 1759, shows how the anti-war sentiment of the opening years of the war drew on the eighteenth-century enlightenment critique of international conflict. Printed under the title ‘The Bishop of London’s Opinion on War’, the lines present a powerful critique of war as the product of kings’ ‘Ambitions’ (p. 16)

Though, probably written in 1791 prior to the outbreak of the war with France,72 Southey published ‘To Horror’ in. Poems (1797), where it becomes an important part of the anti-war strand of that volume (p.24)

 Written in 1797 and published in The Pleasures of Hope in 1799, ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ recounts the journey of ‘Fair Adelaide’ to the banks of the ‘dark-rolling Danube’ in search of her wounded husband, who dies in her arms (ll. 2, 1)77 Campbell removes the gory and gothic elements of Penrose’s original, employing a far more euphemistic language to describe war’s damage … and makes the passion of love and war equally important elements of his hero (p. 26)

Merry’s poem ‘The Wounded Soldier’, written circa 1795 and printed in The Spirit of the Public Journals in 1799, illustrates this fusion of war’s damage to the soldier and to the home in startling fashion (BWP, 242).118 (p. 41)

But the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott. (P. 53)

Southey’s poem was published in January 1799 and the evidence of his Common-Place Book suggests it was written shortly before this, though in later editions he dated it to Westbury 1798, which would mean it could have been written any time after June 1798.6 (p. 82)

            <Text>How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers???????

I'm currently fascinated / mesmerized by this 1960s song "The Masochism Tango": youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOe…
Like, it's actually a fun kinky song, right? Except for what feels like a few points that go "too far" (I think strategically) and thus safely turn the whole thing into a "joke" (and therefore something that can be said in public)
Especially the bit at 3:20 about cigarette burns; it gets a laugh, but he sings it straight, and I know folks who'd be into that.
It makes me have more sympathy for people who want to argue that some 18thC Gothics are trying to subversively smuggle in radical ideas despite not fully committing to those ideas
even if you have to pretend that you're only kidding or otherwise 'take it back', to simply say certain things outright in the first place can be powerful..
..and the self-censored versions can circulate publicly in order to get into the hands of people who know how to decode them
So now I'm thinking of how the Toronto gay scene (in the 70s?) would use newspaper articles "warning" people away from dirty sinful gay hotspots, using lots and lots of detail in order to let other gay people know where to go and what to do
I dunno how to put all of that together, but it feels important somehow! How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers?</Text>

            <Title>ch 1 - digital corpora</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.
 The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to facsimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience flying to California in order to be taught about HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible.
Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.
Current materials acquired include:
* 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue
*42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online
* 10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online
* 4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library
* 466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership
Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).
The second chapter thus establishes the corpora with which I will answer my subsequent questions.</Text>

            <Text>Methodology: ctrl-F “popular”, copy full sentence within which it appears

Ch 1:
So popular did. The Lady of the Lake become with ‘the rough sons of the fighting Third Division’, Ferguson told Scott in a letter from Lisbon of 31 August 1811, that he had ‘nightly invitations’ to read and illustrate passages of it, and on behalf of his ‘messmates of the Black-cuffs’ he had written to London for a copy of the music used, in a stage adaptation of the poem (the song, ‘Hail to the Chief’, would become the Presidential anthem for the United States of America). (P 1)

Waller Scott, the best-selling and most, popular poet of the war years, had a crucial part in this process; his metrical romances, with their spectacular pageants of assembling armies and single combats of knights in. armour, transformed the imagining of war, presenting it as heroic, picturesque, and shaped by the conventions of romance at a time when war was seen to have taken on a new form, to have become modern. (P 2)

Similarly, some brief examples of the popularity of particular writers or forms of writing will help give a sense of the position of war in the poetry of the period. (P. 4)

Scott’s reign as ‘the Monarch of Parnassus’, as Byron called him (BLJ III, 219), ran for much of the rest of the war, and the martial and anti-Gallic nature of his metrical romances was matched, in shorter pieces by other writers which proved almost as popular. (P. 4)

The dominance of war as a poetic subject, and its popularity with both writers and readers, should come as no surprise given the extent to which the war defined Britain during the romantic period. (P. 5)

Indeed, in debates over the use of broadsides for ideological purposes in the 1790s, poetry was often seen as a more powerful, medium than prose because its metre, rhyme, and frequent association with popular and traditional tunes were seen to make it especially memorable for the ‘lower class of people’,.27 (p. 9)

Set to the tune of the well-known drinking song ‘To Anacreon in Heaven’ (now best-known as ‘The Star Spangled Banner’), the ballad’s radical politics and especially its implied invitation to the French to ‘tear off’ Britain’s ‘chains’ made it a target for songs that sought to reappropriate its popular tune and parody its sentiments. (P. 11)

As well as its links with the ballad and song tradition, poetry had strong connections to theatrical and visual culture, which also mediated the war to the British public, frequently calling upon a deep-rooted Francophobia which held a strong place in the popular imagination. (P. 12)

To construct England as warlike, Garrick also draws on the language of the songs and ballads that were becoming popular in the middle of the eighteenth century. (P. 14)

Warton’s poeticization of war proved, extremely influential, both in making conflict a fitting subject for imaginative writing and in creating a particular representational register, complete with personifications, (p.23) classical references, and poetic diction, that was frequently invoked in poetic imaginings of war half a century later (‘ensanguin’d field’ remains one of the most popular terms for the battlefield throughout the war) (p. 22-3)

If the imaginative grand tour of the sublime ode provided one means of transporting the poet and reader to the battlefield, another poetic (p.25) means of paying an imaginative visit to the scene of conflict was provided by the sub-genre of ‘The Field of Battle’ poem, a category which I have named after Thomas Penrose’s highly popular mid-eighteenth-century work of that name.74 (p. 24-5)
Penrose’s poem remained popular throughout the romantic period; it was republished in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in May 1794 and The Courier in January 1800 and included by Thomas Campbell in his Specimens of the British Poets (1819), as well as being widely adapted.75 (p. 55)

For example, it was the model for ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ by Thomas Campbell, who wrote both a number of popular patriotic poems on the war such as ‘Ye Mariners of England’ and ‘Battle of the Baltic’ and other, more sombre pieces such as ‘The Soldier’s Dream’, ‘Hohenlinden’, and ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ itself, (p.26) which while focusing on the destruction of conflict, tend to contain the violence of war within a romantic framework or displace it onto the natural surroundings. (P. 25-6)

It is this role of ‘excit[ing] to war’ that women are often called on to play in the poetry of the period, as in ‘The British Heroes’ published in the Anti-Gallican of 1804, which presents the ‘British fair’ as ‘Like Sparta’s matrons nobly great’—a popular analogy during the war years—as the (p.34) nation’s ‘Wives, mothers, daughters vie | Who most shall heroes animate | To conquer or to die’.95 (p. 33-4)

Published in November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin’s lament predates Nelson’s much celebrated triumph at the battle of the Nile of 1 August 1798, yet even before this ‘glorious victory’ there was no lack of poets keen to sing the actions of British heroes, with the naval victories of Howe over the French on the ‘Glorious First of June’ 1794 and Duncan over the Dutch at Camperdown in 1797 providing popular opportunities.  (P. 47)

Indeed, Pye ended one Ode by inserting ‘at the desire of the King’ lines from a popular bellicose song from an adaptation of Beaumont’s and Fletcher’s play Bonduca, set to music by Purcell in 1695: (p.48)

Boscawen’s figure of the prophetic, national bard opposing Caesar’s invading army was a popular one in the 1790s, partly because it facilitated an appropriation of Gray’s ‘The Bard’ that was easily applicable to the contemporary situation, making the bard a figure addressing a united Britain rather than speaking from its Celtic fringes.148 (p. 52)

Ch 2:

Charlotte Smith’s reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, two months after France’s declaration of war on Britain, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the eighteenth century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. (P. 55)

——

Ch 4

Wordsworth’s political sonnets of 1802–3,on which I will be focusing, were part of the huge outpouring of verse produced to unite, inspire, and. animate the nation during the invasion scares of 1797–8 and 1802–5, the period that has been named ‘the Great Terror’ when ‘invasion was the all absorbing and all pervading topic of correspondence and conversation’ (W &amp; B, I. p. xii.).2 This vast body of verse, some of which has been collected in the two- valuable anthologies The Warning Drum and Napoleon and the Invasion of England,played an important role in the wartime forging of the British (p.100) nation, both mediating the war to the British public and providing a means of patriotic expression, a textual equivalent to the volunteering that has been described as ‘simply the greatest popular movement of the Hanoverian age’.3

———

Ch 5

Walter Scott was by far the best selling and most popular poet of the Napoleonic wars and his metrical romances played a crucial role in mediating conflict to a nation at war. (120)

As Peter Murphy has argued, one of the best ways to gauge Scott’s popularity is to amalgamate the sales for the years 1809–11, when, he had four books of verse on the market, during which two-year period he sold ‘a breathtaking 50,500 copies’5 (121)

Scott’s picturesque treatment of battle was frequently remarked on, as we have already seen in the comments of the reviewers of the Annual Review on The Lay of the Last Minstrel and the British Critic on Marmion&gt;and was a key element in his popularity and critical reputation, as seen in Monthly Review’s comment on The Lord of the Isles that ‘the battle of Bannockburn will remain for ever as a monument of the fertile poetical powers of a writer, who had before so greatly excelled in this species of description.’37  (132)

In his Life of Sir Walter Scott, first published in 1833, Lockhart commented that Scott ‘must ever be considered as the “mighty minstrel” of the Antigallican war’(LWS, III, 54) yet such a claim might seem strange about a poet whose most popular poems were set in the early sixteenth century and whose subject matter—the internal tensions within Scotland and national conflicts between Scotland and England—would seem to emphasize division rather than the unity necessary at a time of crisis. (133)

Scott’s transformation of his readers into warriors was identified as the reason for his popularity in the Eclectic Review’s account of the poet of 1811 discussed in the opening chapter.  (138)

—

Ch 6

This combination of geography and genre in the imaginative shaping of the latest stage of the war was compounded by the fashion for romance produced by the popularity of Scott’s poetry. (149)

While it is obviously overstating the case to say that ‘the whole world read poetry’, the popularity and model of Scott’s romances coalesced with the sense of Spain as a land of romance to provide the major poetic framework for the British understanding of the war. (149)

Here writing half a decade after its conclusion, Hemans associates the Peninsular War with chtvalric history as celebrated by the popular ballads on Roland, who died heroically at Roncesvalles in 778 Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (the ‘Campeador’ or ‘E1 Cid’) who fought the Moors in the eleventh century, and Garcilaso de la Vega, who defeated a Moor in single combat.31 (156)

In the autumn, of 1809, John Murray published John Wilson Croker’s The Battles of Talavem, a poem on Wellington’s, victory over Marshall Jourdan of 27–8th July 1809, which proved remarkably popular, going through eight editions in its first year, a number exceeded only by Scott in the period 1809–10.38 (159)

Scott’s apostrophe, like his opening search for ‘a strain … of mountain fire | [which] May rise distinguish’d o’er the din of war’ (I.1), recalls Shakespeare’s Henry V: ‘O for a muse of fire, that would ascend | The brightest heaven of invention’ (Prologue, 1–2).52 If Scott seeks to associate his poem with a play popular at the time and seen as a patriotic celebration of English triumph over the French, he also invokes the representational problems posed by war (166)

The picturesque techniques of romance made popular by Scott (p.175) are set against the techniques of the sublime or horrific ode on war, familiar from the writings of the 1790s, seen in the personifications of ‘Red Battle’ and the ‘Giant’ War in the previous stanzas frequently compared to the sublime figures of Goya’s war paintings (I. 38–9).80 (174-5)

——

While the popularity of Scott’s metrical romances was superseded by the phenomenal sales of Byron’s poetry and his own success as a novelist in the years after the war, his reimagining of war remained tremendously influential throughout the nineteenth century, playing a major role in the chivalric revival, in the elevation of the warrior to heroic status, and in the romanticization of war that Michael Paris has seen as defining the ‘warrior nation’ from 1850 to 2000.1 (225)

            <Title>what to teach: convo with Jack copy</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

            <Text>"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."</Text>

            <Title>coda? - gothic</Title>
            <Text>A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.</Text>

            <Text>The 1790s in Digital Archives: A Meta-Analysis of Holdings
A major concern regarding digital humanities research is the ability of findings to be “representative.” There is broad understanding that digital archives contain gaps, but little specific knowledge of the nature of those gaps. My project is analogous to a scientific meta-analysis, comparing several major digital collections. I consider all works published in Britain between 1789 and 1799 across six digital archives. The collections examined are heterogeneous, ranging from 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue to 466 XML files created by the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership. I use a range of approaches, including topic modelling, to identify what kinds of literature each corpus emphasizes, and what omissions and errors scholars must be aware of. By comparing the holdings and metadata of these collections, this paper lays groundwork for future scholars to work with digital corpora in a nuanced, selective way.

            <Text>In their own acknowledgement (?), from the beginning, the poet’s occupation and their romantic connection with nature rely upon the support of the women in their lives; certainly Coleridge knew the importance of Dorothy to Wordsworth, and surely knowing of her would have been key to being “in the know” in their whole social circle; effacing these women’s importance wasn’t key to the myth-making yet (?) but was something grabbed ahold of and exaggerated later?</Text>

            <Title>Ch 4: Synthesis / Discussion</Title>
            <Synopsis> Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.

Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.</Synopsis>

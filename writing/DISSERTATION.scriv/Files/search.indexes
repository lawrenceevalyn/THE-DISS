            <Title>Sedgwick</Title>
            <Text>Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: “The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one’s findings: “What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.” The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. </Text>

            <Title>women have leisure in convents</Title>
            <Text>“I came to learn that women have never had a history or culture of leisure. (Unless you were a nun, one researcher later told me.) That from the dawn of humanity, high status men, removed from the drudge work of life, have enjoyed long, uninterrupted hours of leisure. And in that time, they created art, philosophy, literature, they made scientific discoveries and sank into what psychologists call the peak human experience of flow. Women aren’t expected to flow. I read feminist leisure research (who knew such a thing existed?) and international studies that found women around the globe felt that they didn’t deserve leisure time. It felt too selfish. Instead, they felt they had to earn time to themselves by getting to the end of a very long To Do list. Which, let’s face it, never ends. I began to realise that time is power. That time is a feminist issue.”

            <Title>OGS Plan of Study 2017</Title>
            <Text>A recent article by Bode exemplifies a current shift in approaches to digitally-enhanced literary scholarship. Bode builds a critique of “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as complete and objective, Bode argues, it is not different from New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.

I have narrowed my scope to an eleven-year “decade,” keyed to the French Revolution, to make my inquiry feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 works published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.

To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading and corpus stylistics, but I will marry these to bibliographic textual studies and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired bibliographic records for 51,965 works listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewhere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, enabling more detailed computational exploration of their subject matter. 

I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically and influentially during the 1790s, but are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon.

The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and will recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.</Text>

            <Title>surprise!</Title>
            <Text>Thus far, the importance of reparative work to DH is evident. But what about the other direction? Just as, I argue, both DH and bibliography have important resources to offer to each other, so to do I argue that DH has something to offer to reparative reading. Specifically, a well-formulated DH praxis can introduce a new relationship to the experience of surprise which is so challenging in paranoid reading. The most common dismissals of DH research are attempts to say, “we already knew that” — essentially, [PARANOID AVOIDANCE OF UNPLEASANT SURPRISE FROM DH COMING FOR THEIR JOBS]. This reaction invites two responses. First, [if the experiment told us that everything we knew was COMPLETELY WRONG, this would not be very good because probably at least some of what we know is right; an experiment should validate some of our existing knowledge]. [Experiments fall into two categories: those which tell us about our methods, and those which tell us about our fields of study]. Second, as scholars such as Ted Underwood have noted, it is often only retroactively that these discoveries are declared to be “obvious” results which everyone “already knew” (CITE). If we are asked to form an explicit hypothesis in advance, we might be very surprised by the exact numbers. [TRANSITION] Rather than being an awkward fit for my theoretical aims, and rather than pursuing reparative reading in spite of my computational methods, I see the laborious, intimate process of experimental computation as a directly valuable source</Text>

            <Text>Critical algorithm studies is therefore a crucial background for my work — but “critical” is literally in the name of of the field, and I still seek to be post-critical and reparative. As I encounter the limitations of the various information and tools through which I attempt to understand the 1790s, my goal is to do something other than facilely observe that they are limited. Instead, I want to identify the best ways to continue building on their foundations. In a digital humanities context, a focus on building connections can be mundanely practical: typing indexes from print works into spreadsheets, correcting errors within datasets, writing programs to process metadata: all of these maintain the functional usability of existing resources in new contexts. When this kind of extended, detail-oriented labour is combined with serious reflection on the histories and possible futures of these resources, I contend, they bring us to new knowledge. In this, maintaining and using digital resources is also a way to repair them — and to produce reparative readings of their contents.</Text>

            <Text>Reviewed by: 
Thomas Reinert 
p.222: Guillory argues that reforming school syllabi oers only a kind of symptomatic relief for cultural discrimination. Much more important is the exclusivity of schools themselves, and, with them, the forces that work to make literature feel exclusive.
p.222: Guillory argues that schools have repeatedly reconstituted not just the canon but the general practice of literary study so as to align it with the changing interests of the bourgeoisie. In each case, there was a struggle over what it meant socially to study literature, and in each case schools restricted that study to an educated elite by way of insuring literacy’s prestige, class ailiation, and what Guillory calls its “cultural capital.”
p.223: He rejects the view of relativists who believe that aesthetic judgment merely reflects in a roundabout or mystified form a community’s practical interests. The aesthetic has its peculiar feeling and density, he claims; it cannot be reduced to a purely economic eect. On the other hand, neither does it appear apart from political and economic struggle. This is literally true, he argues, in the intellectual history of aesthetic and economic theory.
P.223: . Perhaps most powerful is the chapter on de Man. It moves with remarkable deharisma, Guillory speaks of how de Man brought charisma to routinization. De Man lost his following unjustly as a result of the scandal surrounding his wartime journalism. The critique here of his strange mode of subversiveness makes for a much more satisfactory challenge to his intellectual authority.
p.223-4: The suppleness of the book’s argument overall places Guillory just where it feels right to be. He does not argue for the demolition of the canon or for the abandonment of aesthetic judgment; he advocates, [End Page 223] rather, a struggle to disjoin the study of literature from markers of class prestige and to open up universal access to it. He is, among other things, a lover of books, and he wants everyone to be able to read as many of them as possible.</Text>

            <Title>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British</Title>
            <Text>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British Novel (1994) also investigates the associations between fictional form and politics. For Watson, novelists on both sides of the Revolution debate realised that there was a clear connection between some major themes of the novel and the political debates of the 1790s. The sentimental novel’s depiction of a heroine choosing her own lover in defiance of parental authority,for example,might correlate with disobedience towards political authority,just as an attempted seduction of a heroine could stand for the attempts of insurgents to tempt unwary Britons into sedition. Watson argues that both conservative and radical novelists tried to exploit these metaphorical connections, making the majority of 1790s novels much more political that they might at first appear. Even the very form of the novel,Watson contends, was a political statement in itself. Epistolary novels, for instance, were inherently political because the letter was a deeply suspect article in the 1790s, standing for secret communi- cation between people and connected with espionage, with the evidence used in treason trials and with the radical ‘corresponding societies’ (established in Britain to communicate directly with the Revolutionaries in France). </Text>

            <Text>Introduction:

“This study will examine both the spectacle and the forces that shaped it. Examples of performance, drama and theatrical innovation will illustrate how public entertainment responded to the turbulence in the intellectual climate that sociopolitical changes induced, for, even though London did not suffer the traumas of Paris, it underwent a major cultural crisis.” (1)

p.2: When artists can no longer represent the world in coherent patterns, the recognition of which engenders in the viewer a sense of identification and reassurance with the familiar, they may resort to the use of metaphor. They may rework experience into weird and intriguing patterns that distance the audience from reality -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018

Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery, all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all ± mainpieces, comic or tragic; afterpieces, satirical, farcical, musical or spectacular; interludes of music, song and dance; the wit of prologue and epilogue and above all the attractions of the performers, all received plaudits from all corners of the house. Critics might make sharp comparisons, but little of the programme was dismissed as `trash', or `immoral', or irrelevant `fancy'. (3)

p.5: in the 1790s individual voices became shriller and their ideas more persuasive to a different section of the population, thus contributing to social fragmentation and creating what today we call `identity politics'. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.6: Politicians, philosophers and economists may have to hammer out rational interpretations of the seeming chaos of material reality, but for artists, and, more particularly, for their bewildered audiences, the naturalistic depiction of probability can seem inadequate. Only an evocation of the barely possible provides a satisfying response to the contradictions of a world which `self-evident' principles can no longer explain.

p.6: although `uncommitted' plays far outnumbered those dealing with speci®cally political issues, his analyses of changes in emphasis and attitude show that the impact of events on theatrical taste was crucial ± though indirect. Historians can fall into the same trap as political censors in trying to identify topics, stories and speeches that speci®cally refer to issues of the day, because the relationship is usually more subtle than speci®c precisely because it is unintentional. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
For instance, Pierre Desforges' Le Sourd, ou L'Auberge Pleine was the most popular French play of the period (1789±99), a comedy in which a man pretends to be deaf in order to gain accommodation in a crowded inn. Kennedy accurately summarises the plot and its (p. 7) reliance on conventional tropes and situations: `Stock eighteenth- century themes are skilfully exploited here: marriage of love over marriage of interest, bourgeois frugality and prudence over aristo- cratic honour, testy master-servant relations in which money is the main factor, and the psychology of deaf-mutes . . . It has no political message, only a few social banalities.'V At ®rst glance it does seem very traditional, and, no doubt, contemporary audiences read little into it. But all these `stock themes' have implications in identifying the political sympathies of the audience, and some of the new situations or jokes had a more than stock resonance in the context of its ®rst performance in 1790 ± the legitimate travellers' room and the host's chair at table are `usurped' by an outsider pretending to be deaf. Did the revolutionaries of 1790 seem `deaf to reality'? Or just the provincial ones travelling to Paris? If their policies were a trick, should we admire their cunning or their effrontery? The play posed no such political questions directly of its audience, but its very popularity raises them for the cultural analysts. My own curiosity is raised particularly by the metaphor of deafness being adopted as a strategy for coping with a material problem ± particularly as the number of dramatic characters who are deaf, mute or blind steadily increased during the period under investigation.

Conclusion
p.221: I have, however, argued in some detail that the determining feature of the period for the theatre was the sense of loss, a feeling that things had changed in ways that people did not expect or want, and that theatrical formulations reflected this in images of incarceration, dislocation and supernatural intervention. Plays looked backwards to the past in order to make sense of the present and future. That past provided contradictory settings ± cruel fortresses of feudal power and innocent family homes in rural villages. Homes and security that were continually threatened, but, in dreamlike happy (222) endings, were saved by heroic acts of restoration. But in real life, conflict and change were not resolved so neatly. If traditional powers were restored they were reconstructed in the process, and, when the reconstructions were as thorough as Napoleon's reinvention of autocracy, the factory owner's dispossession of the peripatetic clothier, or Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian reformulation of Enlightenment benevolence, then the oppression seemed worse as it had become more efficient. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.224: These details of theatre administration and financial policy confirm my conviction that capitalism or, as it was then termed, political economy was the one ideology to emerge more confident than before from the intellectual turmoil engendered by the Revolution. What Adam Smith called the `invisible hand' of economic competition was becoming visible. Classical economists and their political equivalents, the Benthamite Utilitarians, began to claim that the market was the only realistic force that could bene®t good, and drive out bad, practice ± not only in commerce, but in all organisations, civic, cultural and even charitable. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.225: The signi®cance of relating these ®nal years is that Godwin encouraged the young Hazlitt to complete Holcroft's un®nished autobiography.W Although Hazlitt probably considered the task a piece of hack work, the book's existence indicates a direct link between pre-Revolutionary radicalism, as professed by Holcroft, and the post-1815 radicalism associated with a new generation of rationalists that included not only Hazlitt but Francis Place and Robert Owen. Holcroft, a self-educated man, never let persecution or disappointment in the course of events undermine his belief that simple honesty could ®nd rational solutions to political problems. In that he was probably the most consistent of those who greeted the dawn of 1789. For many of the so-called Romantics the Terror of 1793, the emergence of Napoleon's personal dictatorship and cultural triumph of bourgeois vulgarity led them to adopt a state of social isolation and intellectual denial. The new radicalism of the 1820s replaced both Holcroft's simple faith in the benevolence of man and the Romantic obsession with individual identity with a new critique of property. Owen called it Socialism. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018</Text>

            <Text>“ESTC’s most basic bibliographical function is to provide, for each edition, a description of the ideal copy, meaning the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it” (Tabor 369).

“The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,” especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). “Panizzis ‘Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book inhis or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.” (Korshin 211)

“Because the ESTC was formed from three different projects over many decades, the existence of subject headings varies. For books that are from the periods 1475-1640 (from the original Short-Title Catalogue created by Pollard and Redgrave) and 1641-1700 (from Donald Wing’s short-title catalogue), subject headings exist. But subject headings were not initially created for the eighteenth-century records in the ESTC, and so subject headings rarely occur for the items in ECCO.” (Karian, “Guide” 3)

An Edition:
“Because ESTC is a bibliographical database rather than a catalogue, strictly speaking, its records describe groups of copies,” such as editions, “rather than specific copies,” such as the Exeter Book (Tabor 369). The ESTC sometimes has separate entries for groups within an edition “when certain separately planned marketing units can be identified within the edition, such as reissues, imprint variants, and large versus regular-paper copies” (Tabor 369). Or, in “the later eighteenth century, when reprints from standing type became more common, ESTC cataloguers have occasionally granularized down to the level of individual impressions” (Tabor 369). Tabor and I both deem the term “edition” a sufficient umbrella term “[f]or the purpose of this discussion” (Tabor 369).
“The first problem relates to the unit of classification. A clearly defined unit is necessary to ensure that a study of change over time is reliable and based on consistent terms. What is the unit that the ESTC uses? Scholars sometimes answer by using the terms “edition,” “issue,” or “title” interchangeably. But since the ESTC does not rely in a consistent manner on any of these terms for its unit of classification, one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC.” (Karian 289)
“For the most part, the ESTC contains a record for each issue” (Karian 289) “Sometimes the ESTC contains additional records if there are multiple states of an edition (a different state results from cancels or minor changes to the setting of type).” (Karian 289)

An Ideal Copy:
“As additional reports of copies arrive, it may be that the ideal description must change in response. For instance, the existence of a half-title may only emerge on the evidence of the seventh copy reported. A half-title would then be added to the description of the ideal copy, and the six previously matched physical copies will receive notes recording that they are imperfect in this respect” (Tabor 370).
“In ESTC the matching process hinges on five points of identity: the title, as far as it is given by ESTC; the edition statement; the imprint, again as far as it is given by ESTC; the pagination; and the format” (Tabor 370).</Text>

            <Title>Citing Source Code in MLA Style</Title>
            <Text>Citing Source Code in MLA Style
By Joseph Wallace
To cite source code—the written portion of a piece of software or a larger program—begin with the MLA format template.1 In what follows, I explain how elements on the template apply to source code and show you how to construct an entry.
Author
Source code can be written by a person, a group of persons, or an organization (e.g., Chromium Authors). Authors are usually specified in the code itself or, on a Web site like GitHub, as the owner of the repository in which the code appears. If individual contributors are not given, treat the organization named as the owner of the license or the holder of the copyright as the author. If the organization is both author and publisher, begin your entry with the title. 
In the rest of the post, I walk you through the process of creating a works-cited-list entry for a work of source code, Buffer.java, where the publisher is the author.
Title of Source
Source code is typically presented in discrete text app/uploads/sites/3, and the file name can serve as the title. When citing titles in MLA style you would normally standardize the capitalization. However, you should not do this for titles of source code. The cases of characters are meaningful in a programming context, so you should reproduce the file name exactly as you found it. Provide the file extension when you give the title. Examples of file extensions on source code app/uploads/sites/3 include .java for Java code, .cc for C++ code, and .py for Python code. To cite the source code for Buffer.java, begin your entry with the title:
Buffer.java.
Title of Container
The container will be either the name of the software or the package in which the code is found.2 A package is a container of source code app/uploads/sites/3 within a larger program. The code for a piece of software is contained in the software itself, and so the software is the container. For Buffer.java, the container is Apache Hadoop, a collection of software:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop,
Version
Since source code often exists in several versions, provide the version of the code you consulted. This could be a version of software, a particular revision in a repository, or a commit hash (a unique string of letters and numbers that identifies a version of a piece of code). This is important information because both URLs and source code tend to change, so providing as much information as possible makes it more likely that readers will be able to find what you are citing. In the example that follows, the commit hash appears after the package name and specifies the version of the code being cited:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c 658987c1dbc3e6fce133f77,
Publisher 
The publisher for the software or the package in which the code is found is usually the organization that produced the code. Here, the software that contains the source code is published by the Apache Software Foundation:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987 c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation,
Date
The date may not be specified in source code, in which case you can omit it. If you do see a date, provide it:
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987 c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation, 2015.
Since there is no information relevant to the “Location” element, this is the end of container 1.
Title of Container 2
If you are consulting code on a Web site, you will need to provide information for that Web site as the second container. In what follows, the Web site GitHub is the second container. No publisher is specified for the Web site GitHub, because it is published by GitHub (MLA Handbook 42).
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987 c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation, 2015. GitHub,
Location
If you are documenting source code on a Web site, provide the URL as the location. The MLA recommends removing “http://” and “https://” protocols from URL addresses in printed works, in which the creation of hyperlinks is irrelevant, although if the protocol is anything else, such as “ftp://,” you should include it. If you are citing these sources in a format that has the ability to display hyperlinks—for instance, if they will be displayed in html—do include the protocol. If the URL does not provide the full path to the file, you should include the full path as the file name. In the example that follows, the URL comes after the container and provides the full path to the file.
Buffer.java. Apache Hadoop, commit ef9946cd52d54200c658987c1dbc3e6fce133f77, Apache Software Foundation, 2015. GitHub, github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/ release-3.1.0-RC1/hadoop-tools/hadoop-streaming/src/main/ java/org/apache/ hadoop/record/Buffer.java.
The examples of in-text citations that follow are adapted from links posted on MIT’s Web site devoted to academic integrity (“Writing Code”). For in-text citations, if you are citing a particular method, class, subroutine, or block of code, provide the line number or numbers if known.
“The method OutputTraceToStream may be found in stack_trace_win.cc, source code written for the Chromium project” (Chromium Authors, line 59).
“As the developers note, this ‘utility class’ was intended to give ‘applets the ability to detect proxy host settings’” (PluginProxyUtil.java).

Notes
I thank Ryan Williams, former senior Web developer at the MLA, for his assistance with this post.
1. A fuller definition of source code, as defined by Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, is “a computer program in its original programming language (such as FORTRAN or C) before translation into object code usually by a compiler” (“Source Code, Noun”). The Linux Information Project specifies that “source code” is “the version of the software as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in plain text (i.e., human readable alphanumeric characters)” (“Source Code Definition”).
2. Usually when citing works in MLA style, you would not consider software to be a container. For example, in the case of a work downloaded from the Internet as a PDF and opened with Adobe Reader DC, Adobe Reader DC is not the container but the tool you used to open the work. When you’re citing source code, however, the software is the work.

            <Title>three Gothic histories</Title>
            <Text>Indeed, the many histories of Gothic studies as a field generally consist of competing claims as to which is the first serious study. This is often taken to be David Punter’s 1996 The Literature of Terror, written more than a decade after queer and feminist examinations of early gothic works, such as Eve Sedgwick and George Haggerty’s studies of Horace Walpole, William Beckford, and Matthew Lewis in 1985 and 1986. 

Gothic criticism has required several different strategies to revalue disreputable literature. (Queer studies, feminist studies, psychoanalytical)
There are three histories of three sorts of Gothic studies: queer Gothic studies, feminist Gothic studies, and ‘serious’ Gothic studies. Those who work on the queer gothic identify, as the catalyst for a reconsideration of the Gothic itself, Eve Sedgwick’s 1985 monograph, Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire. Sedgwick often goes hand-in-hand with George Haggerty’s 1986 article “Literature and Homosexuality in the Late Eighteenth Century: Walpole, Beckford, and Lewis,” which examined the same authors. But those who examine the Female Gothic, employing feminist rather than queer critique, see earlier origins for the field in Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s Madwoman in the Attic (1979) and Juliann Fleenor’s The Female Gothic (1983). And many discussions of the Gothic-qua-Gothic skip directly from Montague Summers’ 1938 The Gothic Quest to David Punter’s 1996 The Literature of Terror, more than a decade after Sedgwick. The Summers-to-Punter historiography is generally invested in a rhetorical move by which Summers’ work is dismissed as sloppy, unscholarly, motivated by mere enthusiasm (though usefully obsessive), such that Punter emerges in contrast as the first examination of the Gothic to be serious. Of course, implicit in this rhetorical move is the idea that feminist and queer scholarship on the Gothic is also unserious, perhaps contaminated by personal enthusiasm.</Text>

            <Text>“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)
“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)
“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and that there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

“The "favorite authors" are all women: Anna Maria Bennett, Regina Maria Roche, Elizabeth [sic] Meeke, Agnes Musgrave, Anna Howell, Mary Charlton, Isabella Kelly, Elizabeth Parsons, Elizabeth Bonhote, and Anna Maria M’Kenzie.” (39)

"Lane claims "All the Works complete of Robertson, Johnson, Henry, Hume, Locke, Pope, Rapin, Goldsmith, Milton, Smollett, Richardson, Garrick, Gibbons, Voltaire, Addison, Rollin, Littleton, Sterne, Shakespeare, Bolingbroke, Fielding, &amp;c.," as well as “every Author of the present Age”” (40)

"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels." (42)

“At the Minerva Press, William Lane, who had printed 11 items in the 1770s and 131 in the 1780s, produced 402 in the 1790s.” (48)

"Of a total of 1036 works published between 1790 and 1820, on average 27% are texts other than novels. ... these texts include 67 different types of compilations, including collections of maxims, sermons, hymns, fairy tales, fables, songs, jokes, and travel accounts, as well as 52 books of instruction on a wide range of subjects including spelling, cooking, brewing, parenting, farriery, medicine, and military matters.” (52)

“works may be classified in more than one category. Thus, a work may appear in two categories within a table (as in both epistolary and sentimental) or be listed in both tables (as in translation and courtship).” (56)

￼(57)

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

            <Title>reparative reading</Title>
            <Text>The theoretical frameworks of this dissertation are drawn from the fields of feminist DH and queer DH, and from non-DH schools of thought which seem to offer valuable tools. My core motivating framework, as I conceptualize my work, is that of reparative reading. Eve Sedgwick’s “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading” persuasively describes in the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism, and attempts to sketch an alternative in what she terms reparative reading. A paranoid rhetoric of exposure and critique strikes me as the most obvious narrative to structure this dissertation’s investigation of the uneven institutional valuation of different writing. However, these obvious critiques also require rejecting many generations of sincere work by my fellow academics, without necessarily offering new discoveries of value to replace them. One experiment of this project, not yet complete, is to articulate an assessment of the limitations of contemporary digital resources which nonetheless allows those resources to be recuperated. My touchstones are two descriptions from Sedgwick’s original chapter:  
The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self. (149)
What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them. (150-151)
What Sedgwick describes, here, is a “desire,” not a methodology. I therefore understand “reparative reading” to refer, not to a precise set of practices, but to a position one might occupy in relation to a text. What I posit is also a desire: that my methods here can provide useful practices for others. The reparative position is a generous one, both in terms of giving of oneself to a text, and in terms of seeking a text’s strengths over its weaknesses. What I learn from Sedgwick, therefore, that attention is the first step toward caring, and that non-judgment can be more informative than rejection.</Text>

            <Title>Wordsworth &amp; More</Title>
            <Text>let’s see, looking though my notes — looks like William Wordsworth writes a ton of poems that are just incredibly pretentious versions of Hannah More’s stories/ballads
Alex: “has that been said before. god I hate wordsworth
such a mansplainer
so that would be a great topic”
Michael Gamer has said, essentially, that Wordsworth is writing more pretentious versions of popular ghost stories
Alex: “proving that he is one of those dudes in a meeting who repeats what the woman said but louder
but no one Hannah More especially?”
no, Hannah More hates ghost stories for the same reason Wordsworth does — they are vulgar and unchristian
but she uses them anyway, the same way wordsworth does
to subvert them into morally improving tales
or, well, WW is less clear w/ moral improvement of individual poems
but Gamer makes a compelling argument re: his overall claim to have “elevated” his material
Alex: “is there room to argue against Gamer, or to move it in another direction then?”
I don’t know that More is a specific source for Wordsworth; it’s not impossible, but also not immediately likely to me. What interests me is the similarity of their rhetorical stance toward their material and their shared mission of “elevating” for moral improvement, contrasted with their success — Wordsworth has got everybody buying his propaganda, More not so much
Alex: “well, he is a dude.......
but I see the question, and how it relates to the question about 1790s you have formulated...
certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business.”
hmmm.. Gamer is mostly making a broader argument about the Gothic as the immediate source for Romanticism, whereas More is essentially orthogonal to Romanticism…
(I agree with &amp; really like Gamer’s argument about the Gothic &amp; Romanticism)
More want to repurpose and “elevate” the Gothic for essentially evangelical Christian ends — it is astonishing how much I like her, really, given that she is the perfect precursor to all those meddling Victorian moralist middle-class ladies
Alex: “right, but you are still seeing something new there, about More, that both fits in with an is distinct from Gamer - and is core to your questions about your period”
yeah, I think I would use Gamer as a leaping-off point to pursue this slightly separate track, about other attempts to elevate/repurpose popular writing
Alex: “sounds chapter-able. very good.”</Text>

            <Title>ch 4 - sampling</Title>
            <Text>In chapter four, having spent the previous two chapters examining my digital corpora as corpora, I finally use them to draw conclusions about the eighteenth century itself. Chapter four examines random samples from each corpus. Random sampling, which Steven Zwicker (Zwicker) and Leo Lahti, Niko Ilomäki, and Mikko Tolonen (Lahti et al.) have applied successfully to the English Short Title Catalogue’s holdings, makes it feasible to apply a greater level of human scrutiny to a large body of texts. For each corpus, I select a small enough number of titles that it is feasible to examine each title individually, and manually research its bibliographic details and contents. Comparing my manual assessments to the databases’s defaults allows me to calculate a probable error rate for each kind of information the database provides, which can then be used to correct the results of experiment run on the full database. I use this information to reflect again on the findings I calculated in chapters two and three. Working manually also allows me to supplement database entries with my own research. In particular, it will allow me to use better metrics of quantity or popularity. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity” (CITE), I will consider the popularity of the works in my random sample in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. Taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I pay particular attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. Identifying this information for the few hundred titles in my sample is not easy, but it is at least possible, unlike carrying out the same process on tens of thousands of titles. Again, I use the results of my manual investigation of my sample to calculate a guess about the corpus as a whole. At the end of the chapter, synthesizing all of my experiments across the dissertation, I postulate my own assessment of the number of titles published each year 1789-99, the relative quantity of various categories of writing, and the gender ratios of each category.</Text>

            <Title>Blanch - Reassessment of Authorship</Title>
            <Text>A Reassessment of the Authorship of the Cheap Repository Tracts Anna Maree Blanch, M.A. 
”At the time of the Repository’s conception in 1794, More’s public profile was that of a playwright and a controversial political commentator, yet, the annals of literary history emphasize her contributions as an educator and religious writer (Brown 32; Yonge Hannah More 463; Philp 67; More Considerations on Religion and Public Education xiv). The Cheap Repository Tracts, a collection of inexpensive moral and religious tracts, are an important factor in the construction of her reputation and the subsequent reception of her work. Indeed, the ‚sublime and immortal‛ Cheap Repository is the primary reason she is considered by some to have been the most prominent woman evangelical campaigner in England between 1780 and 1810 (M. G. Jones 139; Roberts 5; Yonge "Children's Literature of the Last Century" 231).1” (Blanch 1)
“This thesis contends that the extent of Hannah More’s contribution to the Cheap Repository has never been definitively established and that there is a need for clarification of the authorship of individual tracts and bibliographical scholarship relating to the series. This thesis details the current state of bibliographical scholarship as it relates to the Cheap Repository Tracts and identifies those tracts for which authorship can be established conclusively as well as those for which establishing authorship is problematic and must remain inconclusive or unknown. This thesis will also explore the context in which the Cheap Repository Tracts were published and suggest that ascertaining the authorship of individual tracts contributes productively to future criticism of the tracts within their socio-historical, theological and political context. “ (2)
William Roberts was responsible for the first collection of More’s letters published in 1834 and as such heavily influenced the critical reception of More’s biographical life for the next hundred and twenty years. Roberts crafted a version of more through a judicious selection of letters, editing of their contents and general order including dating. See Anne Stott, Hannah More: The First Victorian (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) viii-ix. The accompanying memoir penned by Roberts, and interspersed throughout the four volumes, is filled with his musings and interpretations of the events of Hannah More’s life. For example, Roberts removed criticism of the State and the Church arguably softening the ground for portrayals of More by feminist critics as complicit with the patriarchy. See William Roberts, Memoirs of the Life and Correspondence of Mrs Hannah More, 4th ed., 3 vols. (London: R.B Seeley &amp; W Burnside, 1836). (7)
Volumes of collected Cheap Repository tracts were published in 1798, 1800, 1798, 1799, 1800, 1806, 1818, 1827 and 1839. (Blanch 6)

Scholarly recognition of the lack of clarity regarding the Cheap Repository bibliography, including authorship, dates back to Augustus De Morgan in 1864 (241-45). One of the forefathers on non-traditional authorship attribution, De Morgan was a mathematics professor at London University (S. De Morgan 215-16). (11)
In 1939, G.H. Spinney compiled a bibliography of extant copies of the Cheap Repository tracts, printed by Hazard and Marshall and held by the British Library at that time. He also used the Stationers’ Hall Registers to confirm the date of publication of individual tracts. Although Spinney’s bibliography is often considered authoritative, Mitzi Myers strongly cautions against this confirmatory evaluation (Ford 127; Demers 110; Walker 251; Myers "Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 281, n.9). Spinney’s bibliography is the most comprehensive in terms of discussing the historical context of the relationship between More and the printers of the Cheap Repository. Spinney initially sets the dates for the series at 1795-1798, which are the parameters most commonly repeated by scholars (295). However, Spinney later explains that Hannah More’s day-to- (11)
day involvement with the Hazard and Marshall imprints ended in November, 1797 (295, 307).7 In November, 1797, More appointed Evans and Hatchard as the new publishers (307). Ten months later in September, 1798, More declared the Repository ‚closed,‛ and sold the rights to reprints to Evans, Hatchard and Rivington (Spinney 307-08). From November, 1797, to September, 1798, Evans was the authorized printer the Cheap Repository and was responsible for publishing the ten previously unpublished tracts produced during this period. However, and this is very important, despite being ostensibly sacked in November, 1797, John Marshall continued to sell reprints and publish new tracts under the name of the Cheap Repository, even going to the trouble of entering them under his own name at Stationer’s Hall (308). Seventy-three such tracts were published by Marshall between December, 1797, and November, 1799. (12)
Statements describing Hannah More’s contributions have been repeated by generation after generation of scholars uncontested. The numbers ‚114,‛ for the number of tracts produced between 1795-1798, and ‚50,‛ for Hannah (12)
More’s contributions are repeated ad nauseam. The key quotation which seems to be the source of all subsequent scholarship, is as follows: (13)
Of the 114 different tracts published up to November 1797, 49 bear the initial ‘Z’ and 6 ‘S’. Those signed Z were by Hannah More; those signed S by Sarah More, her sister. The authorship of the ‘Z’ tracts is disclosed in Cadell’s collected edition of Hannah More’s works published in 1818. The statement that ‘S’ tracts were by Sarah More appears in Thompson’s life: he may have it from a private source, though it would not be difficult to guess. We are told in Roberts that the tracts were written by Hannah More with the assistance of her sisters and a few friends. To discover the identity of the ‘few friends’ who between them wrote the remaining 51 is now almost impossible (310).8 (13)
However, the numbers do not add up, and it is not just that the numbers in the quote equal 106, not 114. Spinney’s conclusion specifically states that the count of 114 relates to ‚tracts published up to November, 1797‛ whereas many scholars that cite Spinney’s work and numerical conclusions often substitute an end date of 1798 without clarification or explanation (310). (13)
The lack of particularity in many descriptions of More’s involvement in the Cheap Repository is often the consequence of a heavy reliance on Spinney. Some scholars show explicit deference, such as in the work of Jones (1952), Ford (1996), Smith (1996), and Pharr (1998), which refer to Spinney’s conclusions as to the total number of tracts and More’s contribution. (13)
However, it was over twenty years ago that Mitzi Myers first cautioned against Spinney’s bibliography being considered exhaustive, because it is ‚incomplete‛ ("Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 281, n. 9). In addition to her contention that the Spinney bibliography is ‚incomplete,‛ Myers acknowledges Spinney and Green as the relevant bibliographies, and explains that ‚most, but not all, of the tracts More wrote herself are reprinted in the various editions of her works, as well as in numerous collected editions‛ ("Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 281, n.9). However, Myers does not provide an alternative bibliography or a numerical estimate of More’s contribution, beyond stating that: ‚More contributed almost one-half of the hundred odd pieces‛ ("Hannah More's Tracts for the Times: Social Fiction and Female Ideology" 266).12 Patricia Demers, author of The World of Hannah More (1996), also makes no numerical assertions as to the numbers of tracts or More’s contribution while footnoting Spinney, Jones and Myers (110). (17)
More’s most recent, and efficacious, literary biographer Anne Stott, adroitly describes More as having ‚edit*ed+ the Cheap Repository Tracts‛ and argues that ‚overwhelmingly, the Cheap Repository was *More’s+ creation and her work‛ (178, 338). (18)
Sometimes it appears, at first, that Spinney is not the source relied upon by scholars. However, on further examination it becomes clear that Spinney is in fact the root source for bibliographical claims made about Cheap Repository. For example, Linda Peterson relies on Susan Pederson’s attribution to Hannah More of such tracts as The Riot, The Loyal Sailor; or No Mutineering and Turn the Carpet to Hannah More (410). Susan Pederson in turn describes Hannah More, by Mary Jones, as being her source for the attribution of individual tracts, and specifically for her contention that More wrote ‘over fifty’ of the tracts (85). However, an examination of Jones reveals that she acknowledges Spinney as / her source in her attribution of fifty-one tracts to More. (19-20)

“Fellow bluestocking Mary Russell Mitford also described her as ‚masculine *and+ not in a good sense [...] she [More] writes like a man in petticoats, or a woman in breeches. All her books have a loud voice, and a stern frown, and a long stride‛ (qtd in Myers "'a Peculiar Protection': History, Gender, and Eighteenth Century Literature" 227). Despite the contemporary criticism that More was usurping roles that had traditionally been reserved for men, feminist critics such as Kowaleski-Wallace, Ellen Jordan, Mona Scheurmann, and Eleanor Ty have maligned More as antithetical to the course of social reform and have dismissed her as a passive agent of the patriarchy” (Blanch 87)

            <Text>Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.
 The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to facsimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience flying to California in order to be taught about HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible.
Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.
Current materials acquired include:
* 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue
*42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online
* 10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online
* 4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library
* 466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership
Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).
The second chapter thus establishes the corpora with which I will answer my subsequent questions.</Text>

            <Text>“Digital humanities” is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke’s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified “digital humanities” work.</Text>

            <Text>Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99

My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise …  
TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters – or can you?
TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.</Comments>

            <Text>Contemporaneous with the standing army controversy of the late 1690s was a remarkable campaign of republication of earlier texts, and of textual manipulation, which bequeathed ‘commonwealth’ handbooks to the com- ing century, and established what became a hackneyed canon of political high virtue. This was chiefly the work of the prolific Toland. The Whig martyr Algernon Sidney’s Discourses concerning Government, for which he had been executed in 1683, appeared in 1698; the Works of John Milton came out in 1699; those of the republican James Harrington in 1700. In a shrewd piece of editorial revision, Toland transformed the tone of Colonel Edmund Ludlow’s Civil War Memoirs, written in the 1660s, and published in 1698, softening Ludlow’s militant godly zeal into a secular moralism more suited to Enlightenment sensibilities. To take just one instance of Toland’s tech- nique, a hero of the Civil Wars who in the original manuscript went to his execution like ‘a lamb of Christ’, in the printed edition ‘died like a Roman’ (Worden 1978, 2001). </Text>

            <Title>McCarty: interdisciplinary</Title>
            <Text>Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that “[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation”: the current state of “digital humanities” research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to “hard sciences.” The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables — an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti — is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,” it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy — a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.

            <Text>My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. The “major” works across the period develop from sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. I want to pose the same questions as the authors themselves: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor one’s feelings without being misled by them? In pursuit of this answer, my reading has led me to a subject matter, a methodology, and an affective stance.
I remain committed, for my subject matter, to the 1790s as an incredibly dense period of complex literary production shaped by what Robert Miles identifies as an apocalyptic political rupture.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change. For example, there is a narrative about a naive emotional philosophy in sentimental novels (benevolence), which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature. Perhaps, at its broadest level, this narrative is true or useful, but there are many more ways in which it is false.
One way which I seek to be more accurate is by paying close attention to what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. So, for example, I am interested in Burke’s Reflections as a text which is outcompeted by Williams when it is first published, and attracts a flood of negative responses, but which slowly outcompetes the others and becomes more successful over time as it gains credit for its prescience.
As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one.
My interest in the gothic is thus subsumed within my interest in 18thC strategies of feeling generally; gothic fear and supernatural imagination both represent strategies which are in conversation (and competition) with other strategies, which I also want to integrate.

            <Title>Romantic misfits</Title>
            <Text>“The first [group of ‘misfits’] was excluded from literary history in order to secure the status of those writers who did ‘fit’ (the ‘Romantics’) even as the Romantics themselves based their claim to high literary status on their status as misfits-- on their success in transcending the literary marketplace to which other writers were represented as in thrall (because fitting too well).” (5)

“there are recurring themes, such as the manner in which the ‘structural transformation of the public sphere’ during the Romantic era is itself an integral aspect of the story of how ‘high’ literature was constructed at the expense of the ‘low’ (where ‘public engagement’ becomes a defining feature of the ‘low’, and self-cultivation a quality of ‘high’).” (6) — nowadays we value public engagement; at the time, politics/ethics was publicly engaged…?

	•	“As I see the literary culture of the period, there is a dialectical play between the radical Enlightenment and its counter. But instead of seeing the period Balkanized into three generations, with the first and last favoring ‘enlightenment modes’ and the middle settling into ‘reaction’ (or ‘Counter-Enlightenment’), I detect a constant dialectical play between these two poles that were subjectivities as much as they were political positions and, as a consequence, also stubbornly resistant to rational argument. This dialectical play is driven less by the French Revolution and more by the historical rupture it was seen to constitute. … The sense of crisis induced by the first intimation of ‘global synchronicity’, linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later, and they differ dialectically.” (11)

            <Text>Smith’s personal life sometimes overshadows this career. As her works often make clear to her readers, after a briefly comfortable youth as the daughter of a well-off country gentleman who lived beyond his means, she was married at age sixteen to Benjamin Smith, “son of a prosperous London merchant and owner of Barbados sugar cane plantations. The marriage was contracted hastily to remove her from her paternal home, now dominated by her new wealthy stepmother. Looking back in bitterness nearly forty years later, Charlotte Smith described the event as her father's decision to sell her like a ‘legal prostitute, in my early youth, or what the law calls infancy’ (Smith to Sarah Rose, 15 June 1804)” (Roberts). Benjamin Smith was cruel and violently abusive. He was also so financially irresponsible that his wealthy father, Richard Smith, wanted to prevent Benjamin from inheriting. Charlotte Smith assisted Richard with business correspondence and impressed him as responsible and competent. In recognition of her husband’s unreliability, “she persuaded [Richard] to relieve his son of all his ties to the business and establish him as a gentleman farmer in Hampshire” in 1774 (Zimmerman). Richard Smith died in 1776. “In an attempt to provide for his daughter-in-law, Richard bequeathed the bulk of his property to her children. But he had drawn up his will without professional advice; legal wranglings over the inheritance worth nearly £36,000 soon arose and were not settled until almost forty years later. By 1783 Benjamin had already unlawfully squandered more than a third of this trust and, as a consequence, found himself first in deep debt and then in King's Bench Prison.” (Roberts). After the success of the Elegiac Sonnets allowed Smith to pay for her husband’s release from prison, Benjamin Smith fled to France to escape further creditors. Charlotte Smith moved between England and France over the next year and a half to negotiate his debts, and in 1785, the family was able to return to England. In 1787, after 22 years of marriage, Charlotte Smith legally separated from her husband, “an unusual step for a woman of her time” (Fry 7), and moved to a town near Chichester with her nine surviving children (of the twelve she had given birth to). However, despite this separation, Benjamin Smith retained a legal right to Charlotte Smith’s profits from her writing. Smith moved frequently after her separation, due to financial instability and declining health. “On 23 February 1806 Benjamin died in a debtors' prison and some money reverted to Charlotte Smith. By then she was far too ill to execute her favourite scheme, to settle on the shores of Lake Leman. On 28 October 1806 she died, only eight months after her husband, and seven years before Richard Smith's estate was finally settled.” (Blank)</Text>

            <Text>Finally, chapter 5 of this dissertation examines the works of Hannah More across several digital corpora. Hannah More is selected as a particularly difficult writer to grapple with, both bibliographically and in terms of critical reception. 
Hannah More’s first book published was the pastoral drama A Search after Happiness, published in 1773. Her early writing is focused on the theatre. In 1774 she published her play The Inflexible Captive, which was produced in 1775 at the Theatre Royal in Bath. In 1776, she published Sir Eldred of the Bower and the Bleeding Rock. In 1777, she published her first conduct-book, Essays on Various Subjects, dedicated to the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu. Her play Percy, A Tragedy was also produced at Covent Garden in 1777, running through 1778. In 1779, her third play, The Fatal Falsehood, was performed but was considered a failure, after which More stopped writing for the stage. From this point, she primarily wrote various forms of didactic and religious prose, with the occasional didactic and religious poem. In 1782, she published Sacred Dramas and Sensibility: A Poem, her first foray into poetry. In 1783, she wrote The Bas Bleu, which circulated in manuscript but did not see print until 1786. In 1786 she published Florio, a poem in praise of rural life, and The Bas Bleu. In 1788 she published Thoughts on the Importance of the Manners of the Great to General Society, as well as Slavery: A Poem. More’s first publication in this dissertation’s decade of interest is her 1789 poem, Bishop Bonner’s Ghost. In 1790, she published An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable Works. In 1793, she published “Village Politics,” a counter-revolutionary tract for the poor which came to embody the reaction against Thomas Paine. In 1793, she published Remarks on the Speech of M. Dupont in aid of French emigrant clergy. In 1795 she began the massive undertaking of editing, and largely writing, The Cheap Repository Tracts, the writing for which she is now most known. These tracts were distributed as inexpensive chapbooks from 1795 to 1797. In 1798, she reprinted many of these tracts in volume form. In 1799 she published, under her own name, Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education, and another volume of Cheap Repository tracts. Unlike Charlotte Smith and Mary Robinson, More had a long career after this dissertation’s decade of interest, nearly all in the form of didactic prose. A third volume of Cheap Repository tracts was published in 1800. In 1803, she published some patriotic ballads. 1804 saw “The White Slave Trade,” “an attack on the frivolity of the fashionable world” (Stott). In 1805, she published, anonymously, Hints toward forming the Character of a Young Princess. 1806 saw another edition of tracts in volume form. In 1808 she published her only novel, Coelebs in Search of a Wife. In 1811 she published Practical Piety. In 1812 she published Christian Morals. In 1815 she published Essay on the Character and Writings of St. Paul. In 1817, in response to civil unrest, she began republishing the Cheap Repository Tracts as Cheap Repository Tracts Suited to the Present Times. She reprinted and distributed these from 1817 to 1819, and wrote some new ones. In 1819, she published Moral Sketches and an abolitionist poem. In 1821, she published Bible Rhymes. In 1825, she published The Spirit of Prayer, her last new publication, written at age 80 after more than 50 years of writing. A fifth volume of Cheap Repository tracts appeared in 1827. More died in 1833, age 88.</Text>

The Digital Archive and Print Politics, 1789–99

My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like--in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers-- and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested in print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.
My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will establish, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are developing anti-oppressive and less “extractive” digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own research. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this eleven-year “decade” to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s will highlight the decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women writers. Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth-century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant  literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth-century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history began to be interpreted into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.
Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring  it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions in situations where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.
Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. I will examine individual works and individual authors,  Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as "popular literature”.
Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.
Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical--or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream”--printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a set of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, in context with the print production which they are alternatives to. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me with two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices with the horizon of expectations within the radical circles I expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.
A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work  suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a Gothic parody from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary productions are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.</Text>

            <Text>All of the computational work in this dissertation aims to identify, in as minute detail as possible, all works printed in England between January 1 1789 and December 31 1799. This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799. In England, these events caused strong and variously nationalist reactions in a country which had so recently lost its colonies in America and feared that a French invasion could come at any moment. This is the decade of Common Sense, it is the decade of Lyrical Ballads; it is the decade of Hannah More, it is the decade of Ann Radcliffe; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. Charles Dickens’ now-famous superlatives capture the tension often seen by scholars between ‘Enlightenment’ modes of writing and ‘Romantic’ or ‘Gothic’ modes.
Scholarship on 18thC works often takes the form of evaluating or assigning the cultural capital of individual works, or, perhaps, analyzing the strategies by which they accrue or fail to accrue that capital. The winners of the cultural capital game are the Romantics in poetry and Walter Scott in prose. For example, Simon Bainbridge examines the decade and its poetry through the lens of war to identify “the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott” (3). Both poetry and the poet, in his conception, are pursuing a particular kind of cultural capital that allows them to rise above their own popularity. Richard Cronin’s The Politics of Romantic Poetry and Robert Miles’ [WHICHEVER ONE IT IS], too, seem to treat Scott’s [intensely serious popular romances] as the teleological end of the late eighteenth century birth development within the novel. These works follow a pattern established from the beginning with [Kiely and Tompkins], of treating the novel as synonymous with the realist novel, and treating Romantic and especially Gothic novels as aberrations in the history of the novel, a problem which needs to be explained away. E.J. Clery’s The Rise of Supernatural Fiction has examined at length the historical conditions by which supernatural plot elements began to make limited claims to literary seriousness throughout the eighteenth century. The “rise” she describes is not an increase in volume and prominence of supernatural stories, since her starting point in 1762 (the Cock Lane ghost) is a major national phenomenon with many imitators. Rather, supernatural fiction ‘rises’ when it acquires cultural legitimacy. Michael Gamer has more recently expanded on how this ‘rise’ fuelled Romanticism’s own rise. Gamer, like Bainbridge and Cronin, primarily examines Wordsworth and the ‘winners’ of the struggle for cultural capital: I, like Clery, am more interested in the ‘losers.’ Accordingly, I attend to much that is not literature, in order to better understand why it is not.</Text>
            <Comments>Although these events, of course, did not occur on January 1 or December 31, respectively, the entirety of 1789 and 1799 are both included in my study, out of sheer technological necessity.</Comments>

            <Title>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London</Title>
            <Text>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London Stage, 1789–1805 (2000), follows the same general line of argument. Taylor shows that although smaller theatres had been able to avoid the Lord Chamberlain’s restrictions at the time the Revolution broke out, and had therefore been able to exhibit some enthusiastic dramatisations of events in Paris, censorship was quickly imposed across all London theatres. This forced engagement with the Revolution to become more covert. Censorship meant that British radical writers ‘had to relinquish the theatre as a means of rational instruction’, and political comment was forced into seemingly unlikely theatrical modes: musical entertainments, pantomimes, and above all a new offshoot of the gothic, the melodrama (99). Throughout the 1790s, Taylor argues, political anxieties and hopes were represented by metaphor, images of imprisonment, blindness or dispossession being routinely employed as veiled but recognisable references to current events.

            <Title>many definitions of DH</Title>
            <Text>The many criticisms which Klein compiles, Bode argues, “describe the symptoms – not the essence – of a problem, which in fact inheres in Moretti’s and Jockers’s common neglect of […] the bibliographical and editorial approaches that explore and explicate the literary-historical record,” a neglect which is itself “not an effect of importing data into literary history but is inherited from the New Criticism” \cite{Bode:2017gb}.

Klein also suggests a change in how models are formed: “Instead of first asking what can be modeled—what phenomena we can track at scale—we might instead ask: what might be hidden in this corpus? And are there methods we might use to bring out significant texts, or clusters of words, that the eye cannot see?” \cite{Klein:2018to}.The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological. These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.” Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life. This kind of work is increasingly described as “digital cultural studies.” In positioning this work as a “DH” dissertation, I might at first glance seem to belong squarely within the first framework, that of the “computational humanities.” To be sure, much of this work is intended to apply existing computational methodologies to conduct otherwise old-fashioned literary research. My objects of study are by no means contemporary. Several of my contributions, too, are purely methodological in nature, in the development of new code and new guidelines for computational research using particular digital resources. However, as a fuller discussion of Johanna Drucker’s distinction between “data” and “capta” will elucidate later in this chapter, no computational research exists separately from a specific, local, culturally-defined context. Accordingly, my computational research into eighteenth-century literature and my development of new computational methodologies are both inevitably tied to “digital culture.” My results often have more to say about contemporary digital archives, and the history of literary record-keeping, than they do about the eighteenth century itself. I therefore rely on an extensive body of work in cultural digital studies to examine not only the eighteenth century, but eighteenth century studies.</Text>

            <Title>no longer considering scales as different models</Title>
            <Text>My initial thesis proposal proposed approaching my decade of interest by examining three different “models” of different levels of detail: “One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.”
I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.</Text>

            <Text>Methodology: ctrl-F “popular”, copy full sentence within which it appears

Ch 1:
So popular did. The Lady of the Lake become with ‘the rough sons of the fighting Third Division’, Ferguson told Scott in a letter from Lisbon of 31 August 1811, that he had ‘nightly invitations’ to read and illustrate passages of it, and on behalf of his ‘messmates of the Black-cuffs’ he had written to London for a copy of the music used, in a stage adaptation of the poem (the song, ‘Hail to the Chief’, would become the Presidential anthem for the United States of America). (P 1)

Waller Scott, the best-selling and most, popular poet of the war years, had a crucial part in this process; his metrical romances, with their spectacular pageants of assembling armies and single combats of knights in. armour, transformed the imagining of war, presenting it as heroic, picturesque, and shaped by the conventions of romance at a time when war was seen to have taken on a new form, to have become modern. (P 2)

Similarly, some brief examples of the popularity of particular writers or forms of writing will help give a sense of the position of war in the poetry of the period. (P. 4)

Scott’s reign as ‘the Monarch of Parnassus’, as Byron called him (BLJ III, 219), ran for much of the rest of the war, and the martial and anti-Gallic nature of his metrical romances was matched, in shorter pieces by other writers which proved almost as popular. (P. 4)

The dominance of war as a poetic subject, and its popularity with both writers and readers, should come as no surprise given the extent to which the war defined Britain during the romantic period. (P. 5)

Indeed, in debates over the use of broadsides for ideological purposes in the 1790s, poetry was often seen as a more powerful, medium than prose because its metre, rhyme, and frequent association with popular and traditional tunes were seen to make it especially memorable for the ‘lower class of people’,.27 (p. 9)

Set to the tune of the well-known drinking song ‘To Anacreon in Heaven’ (now best-known as ‘The Star Spangled Banner’), the ballad’s radical politics and especially its implied invitation to the French to ‘tear off’ Britain’s ‘chains’ made it a target for songs that sought to reappropriate its popular tune and parody its sentiments. (P. 11)

As well as its links with the ballad and song tradition, poetry had strong connections to theatrical and visual culture, which also mediated the war to the British public, frequently calling upon a deep-rooted Francophobia which held a strong place in the popular imagination. (P. 12)

To construct England as warlike, Garrick also draws on the language of the songs and ballads that were becoming popular in the middle of the eighteenth century. (P. 14)

Warton’s poeticization of war proved, extremely influential, both in making conflict a fitting subject for imaginative writing and in creating a particular representational register, complete with personifications, (p.23) classical references, and poetic diction, that was frequently invoked in poetic imaginings of war half a century later (‘ensanguin’d field’ remains one of the most popular terms for the battlefield throughout the war) (p. 22-3)

If the imaginative grand tour of the sublime ode provided one means of transporting the poet and reader to the battlefield, another poetic (p.25) means of paying an imaginative visit to the scene of conflict was provided by the sub-genre of ‘The Field of Battle’ poem, a category which I have named after Thomas Penrose’s highly popular mid-eighteenth-century work of that name.74 (p. 24-5)
Penrose’s poem remained popular throughout the romantic period; it was republished in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in May 1794 and The Courier in January 1800 and included by Thomas Campbell in his Specimens of the British Poets (1819), as well as being widely adapted.75 (p. 55)

For example, it was the model for ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ by Thomas Campbell, who wrote both a number of popular patriotic poems on the war such as ‘Ye Mariners of England’ and ‘Battle of the Baltic’ and other, more sombre pieces such as ‘The Soldier’s Dream’, ‘Hohenlinden’, and ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ itself, (p.26) which while focusing on the destruction of conflict, tend to contain the violence of war within a romantic framework or displace it onto the natural surroundings. (P. 25-6)

It is this role of ‘excit[ing] to war’ that women are often called on to play in the poetry of the period, as in ‘The British Heroes’ published in the Anti-Gallican of 1804, which presents the ‘British fair’ as ‘Like Sparta’s matrons nobly great’—a popular analogy during the war years—as the (p.34) nation’s ‘Wives, mothers, daughters vie | Who most shall heroes animate | To conquer or to die’.95 (p. 33-4)

Published in November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin’s lament predates Nelson’s much celebrated triumph at the battle of the Nile of 1 August 1798, yet even before this ‘glorious victory’ there was no lack of poets keen to sing the actions of British heroes, with the naval victories of Howe over the French on the ‘Glorious First of June’ 1794 and Duncan over the Dutch at Camperdown in 1797 providing popular opportunities.  (P. 47)

Indeed, Pye ended one Ode by inserting ‘at the desire of the King’ lines from a popular bellicose song from an adaptation of Beaumont’s and Fletcher’s play Bonduca, set to music by Purcell in 1695: (p.48)

Boscawen’s figure of the prophetic, national bard opposing Caesar’s invading army was a popular one in the 1790s, partly because it facilitated an appropriation of Gray’s ‘The Bard’ that was easily applicable to the contemporary situation, making the bard a figure addressing a united Britain rather than speaking from its Celtic fringes.148 (p. 52)

Ch 2:

Charlotte Smith’s reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, two months after France’s declaration of war on Britain, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the eighteenth century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. (P. 55)

——

Ch 4

Wordsworth’s political sonnets of 1802–3,on which I will be focusing, were part of the huge outpouring of verse produced to unite, inspire, and. animate the nation during the invasion scares of 1797–8 and 1802–5, the period that has been named ‘the Great Terror’ when ‘invasion was the all absorbing and all pervading topic of correspondence and conversation’ (W &amp; B, I. p. xii.).2 This vast body of verse, some of which has been collected in the two- valuable anthologies The Warning Drum and Napoleon and the Invasion of England,played an important role in the wartime forging of the British (p.100) nation, both mediating the war to the British public and providing a means of patriotic expression, a textual equivalent to the volunteering that has been described as ‘simply the greatest popular movement of the Hanoverian age’.3

———

Ch 5

Walter Scott was by far the best selling and most popular poet of the Napoleonic wars and his metrical romances played a crucial role in mediating conflict to a nation at war. (120)

As Peter Murphy has argued, one of the best ways to gauge Scott’s popularity is to amalgamate the sales for the years 1809–11, when, he had four books of verse on the market, during which two-year period he sold ‘a breathtaking 50,500 copies’5 (121)

Scott’s picturesque treatment of battle was frequently remarked on, as we have already seen in the comments of the reviewers of the Annual Review on The Lay of the Last Minstrel and the British Critic on Marmion&gt;and was a key element in his popularity and critical reputation, as seen in Monthly Review’s comment on The Lord of the Isles that ‘the battle of Bannockburn will remain for ever as a monument of the fertile poetical powers of a writer, who had before so greatly excelled in this species of description.’37  (132)

In his Life of Sir Walter Scott, first published in 1833, Lockhart commented that Scott ‘must ever be considered as the “mighty minstrel” of the Antigallican war’(LWS, III, 54) yet such a claim might seem strange about a poet whose most popular poems were set in the early sixteenth century and whose subject matter—the internal tensions within Scotland and national conflicts between Scotland and England—would seem to emphasize division rather than the unity necessary at a time of crisis. (133)

Scott’s transformation of his readers into warriors was identified as the reason for his popularity in the Eclectic Review’s account of the poet of 1811 discussed in the opening chapter.  (138)

—

Ch 6

This combination of geography and genre in the imaginative shaping of the latest stage of the war was compounded by the fashion for romance produced by the popularity of Scott’s poetry. (149)

While it is obviously overstating the case to say that ‘the whole world read poetry’, the popularity and model of Scott’s romances coalesced with the sense of Spain as a land of romance to provide the major poetic framework for the British understanding of the war. (149)

Here writing half a decade after its conclusion, Hemans associates the Peninsular War with chtvalric history as celebrated by the popular ballads on Roland, who died heroically at Roncesvalles in 778 Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (the ‘Campeador’ or ‘E1 Cid’) who fought the Moors in the eleventh century, and Garcilaso de la Vega, who defeated a Moor in single combat.31 (156)

In the autumn, of 1809, John Murray published John Wilson Croker’s The Battles of Talavem, a poem on Wellington’s, victory over Marshall Jourdan of 27–8th July 1809, which proved remarkably popular, going through eight editions in its first year, a number exceeded only by Scott in the period 1809–10.38 (159)

Scott’s apostrophe, like his opening search for ‘a strain … of mountain fire | [which] May rise distinguish’d o’er the din of war’ (I.1), recalls Shakespeare’s Henry V: ‘O for a muse of fire, that would ascend | The brightest heaven of invention’ (Prologue, 1–2).52 If Scott seeks to associate his poem with a play popular at the time and seen as a patriotic celebration of English triumph over the French, he also invokes the representational problems posed by war (166)

The picturesque techniques of romance made popular by Scott (p.175) are set against the techniques of the sublime or horrific ode on war, familiar from the writings of the 1790s, seen in the personifications of ‘Red Battle’ and the ‘Giant’ War in the previous stanzas frequently compared to the sublime figures of Goya’s war paintings (I. 38–9).80 (174-5)

——

While the popularity of Scott’s metrical romances was superseded by the phenomenal sales of Byron’s poetry and his own success as a novelist in the years after the war, his reimagining of war remained tremendously influential throughout the nineteenth century, playing a major role in the chivalric revival, in the elevation of the warrior to heroic status, and in the romanticization of war that Michael Paris has seen as defining the ‘warrior nation’ from 1850 to 2000.1 (225)

            <Text>One potential chapter, for example, might examine Hannah More and William Wordsworth’s varying use of supernatural content and ballad forms as literary tools to “elevate” their readers. This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.</Text>

            <Text>Chapter three does for Robinson the same initial process that chapter two did for Smith: I assemble, from a range of scholarly resources, an authoritative list of Robinson’s publications, and seek them in each of the six databases. My initial hypothesis is that, due to Robinson’s different posthumous reception, proportionally fewer of her works will be included in smaller archives compared to Charlotte Smith. In addition to comparing Robinson’s inclusion to Smith’s, I will use Robinson to explore the structural makeup of my databases, examining their representation of “authorship” the way I used Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets to examine their representation of “editions.” Robinson frequently wrote under pseudonyms or left works unsigned: how do the databases I examine handle authorship attribution? Discussing the digital encoding of Robinson’s authorship raises the subject of authorship more generally, as a flexible concept which can resist strict encoding. In particular, it draws attention to the importance of unsigned works, as distinct from anonymous works, and “open secrets” of authorship. As with Smith, I close the chapter with a consideration of Robinson herself as an author.</Text>
            <Comments>For example, several attempts at statistical authorship attribution have, rather than clarifying a singular author for a piece, instead pointed to the essential role of collaboration.

            <Text>Reforming the Gothic reader in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads
Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]
Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)
My project filling the gap: Hannah More!
Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.
[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

            <Text>Is there a way in which this can be said to be, overall, about how texts do or don't 'enter' a 'canon' of writings - by which you mean, as per e.g. Guillory or Bourdieu, and the idea of cultural capital, a set of texts studied, produced, valued (to varying degrees over time) within certain cultural fields, most especially the field of academic research (but also education, modern publishing, creative industries etc). And then your contribution to the many discussions that go on about (and indeed change) canon, is to bring show we can use digital tools to ask and answer that question? I think maybe it is, and if that is the case, then you need to say just that, and that the other issues - timelessness, popularity, marginalization, immediacy, fall out of that larger question… If you frame it like this, and I think I am suggesting you should, it will force you to have a preliminary chapter or part of the introduction where you review terms/concepts like ‘popularity’ or indeed, canon, or ‘marginalization’ - all of which have their own literatures, outside of DH, but also sometimes in or adjacent it (see e.g. the arguments of Lesser, Farmer, Blayney about Shx’s popularity as measured by edition output and print runs - which used some very basic data tools). You need this because at the moment, you just jump into the studies without the framing questions well established. Such a chapter/intro would also enable you to deal directly with the way that other researchers in your fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address these questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading. 

This initial chapter/introduction  I am imagining would also deal with “why 1790s literature” and who else treats the 1790s as a period worthy of cordoning off like this (thus, who your scholarly interlocutors are). 

Finally, you’ve not tried to articulate the queer theory piece here. I think you should, perhaps by thinking with something like this… https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/406/406.pdf.

Having granted the obvious fact that acts of evaluation are always presupposed by the process of canon formation as a necessary but not sufficient condition of that process, I then attempted to demonstrate in the following chapters that the institution which is the historical site of these evaluative acts--the school--subordinates specific values expressed in works to the social functions and institutional aims of the school itself. It is only when presented as canonical, as the cultural capital of the schools, that individual literary works can be made to serve the school's social function of regulating access to these forms of capital.” (269)
“this... does not mean that the selection of works is merely arbitrary." (269)
main criteria is "aesthetic" -- can even outweigh "manifestly repugnant or socially obsolete values” (270)
"as 'aesthetic’ objects, cultural works are not so much the sum of the values they express as the effective transcendence of them, the embodiment of ‘aesthetic value.’” (270)
circularity of definitions of 'aesthetic’ (272)
"the refusal of the aesthetic is an epistemic feature of current critical practice, constituting a consensus powerful enough to enlist in an alliance of 'left' critiques even the form of left critique--Marxist theory—historically sympathetic to aesthetics." (274)
“there is a discourse of aesthetics long before there is any conception of 'aesthetic value.’” (274)
“The fact that communities do function as though they could legislate values within their borders, and not in response to the perceived values of other imagined communities, is the most definitive testimony to their imagined status." (279)
"It is no accident that the problem of a specifically ‘aesthetic value' should arise most urgently in the debate on pornography, for it is just in this context that the distinction between aesthetic discourse and the discourse of value evinces the pretensions of both discourses to 'universalize’ / within the boundaries of 'local' communities a particular value." (279-80)
“the familiar dilemma of the contemporary critique of the canon, which always has before it the theoretically suspect option of devaluing canonical works on the basis of disapprobated values expressed within them." (281)
Smith's theory of aesthetic value: “The biophysiological mechanisms of survival are transposed into the social realm not as the subject's aesthetic cognition or perception (as in Kant) but as nothing other than the process of canon formation conceived as the survival of the fittest /object/. ” (293)
“'An object or artifact that performs certain desired/able functions particularly well… being perhaps not only ‘fit’ but exemplary... will have immediate survival advantage' (48). Smith is in this way able to spin out her evolutionary analogy into a full-scale theory of canon formation. Once canonized, a work tnds to remain so if 'it continues to perform /some/ desired/able functions prticularly well, even if not the same ones for which it was initially valued’ (49).” (293)
as a result, Smith argues, certain dense and complex texts are particularly fit for canonization, because they are well suited for frequent re-interpretation (293)
Guillory's frustration with evolutionary analogies p. 294 might be relevant if I do use Dawkins' meme theory
"social function inheres in the /category/ of the object--in the function of a particular genre, or of literature, or of art.” (295)
"function" is contingent on a prior act of classification (295)
Simmel: “'There are two sides of our relationships to objects, which we call subjectively our desire ad objectively their value' (75)” (298)
he's STILL just talking about all the ways he disagrees with Smith (299)
Smith and Simmel both treat use value and exchange value as the same, but "the discourse of political economy is founded in the eighteenth century on the /distinction/ between use value and exchange value" (300) because commodities aren't priced in terms of use value at all
as "a historical fact” of how this discourse developed, ”the virtual irrelevance of use value to economic discourse can simply be assumed” (301)
"Thus political economy relegates use value to a domain of subjectivity, which it cannot enter into the equation of exchange value. Conversely, the discourse of utilitarianism attempts to reduce the domain of the economic to the expression of the individual subject's needs or desires, and its individualism cannot account for the manifest independence of exchange value from determination by the individual subject." (302)
both “aesthetics and political economy /as discourses/ ... gestate in the body of what in the eighteenth century was called 'moral philosophy,' and the can be said…to have been separated at birth" (303)
"the practice of judging works of art need make no reference at all to the concept of value before the emergence of political economy… the comparison of authors or works to one another need not at that time be expressed as the comparison of their relative 'aesthetic values,' because neither the concept of the aesthetic, nor the concept of value, are as yet defined in such a way that they can be yoked together.” (303)
“The largest historical condition for the formation of a discourse of moral philosophy is the emergence in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of ‘civil society' as a distinct and relatively autonomous sector of the social order, the sector of economic competition, commerce, and production.” (304)
“The manifest dependence of the welfare of the nation upon the sectors of trade and manufacture generated a set of policy problems for which no traditional discourse provided solutions; preeminent among these was the problem of to what extent the state was needed to intervene in these sectors of trade or commerce." (304)
“Moral philosophy saw ‘civil society’ as a collection of individuals, relatively unrestrained by the state in their competition with each other, each acting in his or her immediate interest. The problem was to deduce the principle of the manifest order of society from the apparent disorder of incompatible individuals self-interests.” (305)
British “analogy between the aesthetic and the social order” -- discuss the social order as a matter of 'taste’ (305)
“On the Continent, by contrast, civil society was less well developed" (306) -- I'm just quoting this because it's a funny phrase to me
make art instead of luxuries to check the progress of vice (307)
distinction between art and commodity not perfect: novels &amp; prints manufactured in bulk, useful china &amp; furniture can have opulent designs (308)
“Moral philosophy could thus generate... a distinction between objects on the basis of whether they were directed to the end of utility…or to the end of contemplation” (308) - a new systematic distinction
“The division of labor, the employment of wage-labor, vastly increased the accumulation of commodities, but it did not necessarily increase their fineness; it rather exposed the apparent aesthetic inferiority of commodities to works of art. Hence the qualitative distinction between the work of art and the commodity could be coordinated with class distinction as the distinction between taste and the lack of it.”(313)
“In order to reestablish the proportion of production and consumption, polticial economy must invent the concept of 'use value,' on the /analogy/ of 'exchange value.’ Casting its lot with an ahtropology of needs, it has to forget the aesthetic theory which posited the surplus of beauty over use as the motor of production, as the engine of social life. The theory of taste becomes irrelevant to political economy, and the 'invisible hand' can be reconceived" (315)
“just as bourgeois political economists found it necessary to discard aesthetics, in order to make sense of the system of production and exchange, so did the bourgeoisie find it necessary to take up a 'pure' aesthetics supposedly uncontaminated by economic considerations, in order to distinguish itself /culturally/ from the class which produced what it consumed." (316)
"It is too easy to refute Hume or Kant as though their problem of /taste/ were simply identical to our problem of aesthetic /value/. By ignoring the specificity of these terms, we lose sight of the historical moment when the 'standard of taste' moved into analogical relation to the 'measure of value.' … a reversal of the charges ... Where, before the advent of Adam Smith's political economy, the harmony of the economic order could be analogized to the beauty of the work of art, subsequently it becomes possible and even necessary to reconcieve aesthetic judgment by /analogy to exchange value/.” (317)
“aesthetics immediately reasserted, against the universality of economic commensurability, a theory of the incommensurability of aesthetic and economic values, on the basis of the inutility of the aesthetic object.” (317)
“This mutual forgetting constitutes aesthetics and political economy as antithetical discourses which between them divide the world of cultural production into works of art and commodities." (317)
transition to impact on political economy when aesthetics becomes separate discourse (319)
“the largest unresolved problem in social theory, the problem of the relation between the economical and the cultural" (320) -- his big Q
"The premise of our social life is the absolute commensurability of everything. The language of judgment has been transformed into the discourse of ‘value-judgments’” --&gt; "cultural relativism's celebration of the plurality of values” (323)
“the market is the historical /condition/ and not merely the proper analogy for the extension of the value-concept to all acts of judgment." (324)
“both 'values' and the discourse of value are historically /determined/ as objective social facts." (325)
Bourdieu: “Symbolic goods are a two-faced reality, a commodity and a symbolic object: their specifically cultural value and their commercial value remain relatively independent although the economic sanction may come to reinforce their cultural consecration." (Guillory 325)
“exchange in the market really does function as an epitome of social relations, as everyone thought it did, but as the site of the objective disharmony of these relations, as the site of the commensuration of the incommensurable values objectified in every object. The 'logic of equivalence,' according to which every exchange is supposed to be an /equal/ exchange, denies the crucial fact revealed in the market, that social relations do not /make sense/.” (326)
“The status of canonical literary works as cultural capital was negotiated as though cultural capital were directly convertible into material capital, in which case works of high literary art ought to have been expensive, difficult of access." (329) but that didn’t happen
“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education” (329-330)
"as cultural works recede into the past, the simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (330)
Bourdieu - “while there are _two_ fields of production-- the restricted (High Art) and general (cultural commodities)-- there are _three_ principles of legitimacy specific to these fields” aka 1, ‘“art for artists” (“'art for art's sake’"); 2, art for the social elite, “‘bourgeois' taste”; 3, "the principle of legitimacy which its advocates call 'popular’,” mass consumption (330)
"For Bourdieu, aesthetic judgment comes in two forms: an elite aesthetic of the dominant classes, the ‘aesthetic disposition' proper, and a ‘popular' aesthetic of the dominated." (332)
“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
"To say that the aesthetic disposition determines the relative cultural capital granted to any particular work is to say that the act of judgment is the assignment, or even the recognition, of cultural capital. Judgment is the act by which the aesthetic disposition expresses or externalizes itself, according to criteria which are relatively internalized, that is, neither capable of being fully rationalized, nor materially caused in the manner of a biological predisposition.” (332)
“the nature of aesthetic pleasure itself is rendered entirely problematic" -- always 'deferred' or intellectual pleasure which is contrasted with distastefully immediate pleasures of mass media (333)
“at the level of the dominant aesthetic, the 'pleasure' in aesthetic pleasure is ideally reduced to a zero-degree, to the experience of ‘distaste,' while at the level of the popular aesthetic, the pleasure produced by cultural products fails to be aesthetic at all. At neither level is 'aesthetic pleasure' actually experienced by anyone." (333)
“What appears in the place of aesthetic pleasure in the dominant classes is the pleasure of _distinction_, pleasure in the possession of cultural capital." (333)
form vs content -- “a reductio at adsurdum of aesthetic topoi — in the case of the dominant classes, the evacuation of content; in the case of the dominated, the rejection of form" (334)
“As Michael Denning has recently reminded us, there are innumerable examples in working-class cultural forms of formal experiment and variation; it is precisely the experience of formal innovation which engages interest and admiration in these consumers, even though such manifestly aesthetic experience... may fail to be recognized as aesthetic.” (336)
“the largest effect of the discourse of canonicity: the illusion that aesthetic experience is really restricted to the experience of High Cultural works." (336)
“Bourdieu is certainly right that it is impossible to experience any cultural product apart from its status as cultural capital (high or low); and even more, that it is impossible to experience cultural capital as disarticulated from the system of class formation or commodity production. There is no realm of pure aesthetic experience, or object which elicits nothing but that experience. But I shall nonetheless argue that the specificity or aesthetic experience is not contingent upon its ‘purity.' ... It may well be impossible for example, to experience 'just sex,’ exclusive of the social meanings of sexual acts. But it would be incorrect on that account to deny the specificity of the sexual. If the revelation of the impurity of the aesthetic tempts one to deny its reality, that logical misstep is the consequence of the historical determinations which have produced aesthetic discourse as a discourse of purity.” (336)
"The recognition of cultural capital, otherwise known as aesthetic judgment, must deny, as a condition of its exercise, the ubiquity of aesthetic experience, the fact that such experience utterly pervades the field of cultural production." (336)
“Bourdieu's sociology radically historicizes the ‘aesthetic disposition' by insisting upon its determination within a class-structured society" (337)
thought experiment: "If the status of cultural products as cultural capital is in certain historical circumstances overdetermined by limited access to certain works, or by limited access to the means of consumption, then one might hypothesize that a total democratization of access to cultural products would disarticulate the formation of cultural capital from the class structure and from the markets. In that event, what would constitute cultural capital?” (337)
Marx's answer: “‘In a communist society there are no painters but at most people who engage / in painting among other activities.’” (337-338)
“The idea of production for the producers (which by definition entails /consumption/ by the producers) projects onto a utopian screen the disarticulation of cultural capital from the system of class formation, and thus from ‘distinction' based on inequality of access to cultural goods. Bourdieu calls this condition 'total autonomy from the laws of the market.' Such a condition does not, however, prophesy the disappearance of cultural capital. The universalization of restricted production would rather transform cultural capital into pure 'symbolic distinction.’” (339)
“Even were such an educational system no longer to regulate access to cultural capital in the grotesquely unequal way it presently does, cultural producers would still compete to have their products read, studied, looked at, heard, lived in, sung, worn, and would still accumulate cultural capital in the form of 'prestige’ or fame. But social distinctions reinstated on such an aesthetic basis would have to be expressed in social relations as distinctions in ‘lifestyle,' in other words a vast enlargement of the field of aesthetic judgment." (339)
“What we call canon formation would then become a much larger part of social life, because not restricted to the institutions of the materially advantaged.” (339)
Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)


Footnotes

“8Eagleton's views of the work of art in this context are fairly represented by his chapter on "Marxism and Aesthetic Value," in Criticism and Ideology (London: Verso, 1976). Lentricchia has recently repudiated those literary materialists who "speak as if the real enemy were the aesthetic" in an inteview with Imre Salusinszky, Criticism in Society (New York: Methuen, 1987),200. More recently Perry Ander- son has observed in his English Questions (London: Verso, 1992): "For aesthetic value is not to be dispatched so easily-the wish to finish with it recalling Dob- rolyubov, or Bazarov, more than Marx or Morris. Railing at canons is not the same as replacing them, which they have resisted. Evacuation of the terrain of literary / evaluation in the traditional sense necessarily leaves its conventional practitioners in place" (243).” (378-379)
“9Tony Bennett, "Really Useless 'Knowledge': A Political Critique of Aesthetics," in Thesis Eleven 12 (1985),33.” (379)
“16This point, one would hope, clarifies a confusion that derives from the appar- ent discrepancy between Smith's willingness to speak on the one hand of some works as "information-rich," and 0 0 that basis more likely to become canonical in the first place (51), and on the other hand to insist that any evaluative distinction between, for example, "Shakespeare's poetry" and "doggerel" is simply contingent in the sense that one may "prefer" doggerel in those contexts where it is the func- tion of doggerel that one is interested in. True enough! But does it matter that these latter functions are never going to be those in which the canonical status of the work is at issue? It is simply not likely that Shakespeare's poetry and some example of doggerel verse are ever going to be seriously compared in the first place. The in- teresting question is why we might think that we need to give some account of why it is Shakespeare's poetry and not some example of doggerel verse which comes to be canonical. In the actual circumstances of commensuration, doggerel verse will be compared to other doggerel verse, or Shakespeare's work to other work in simi- lar genres.” (379)
“0ne might return in this context to Herrnstein Smith's polemic against Bataille and Baudrillard for their supposed denial of the principle of economic utility. A response to that polemic would obviously point out that both Bataille and Bau- drillard are concerned with the historical conditions of capitalist social relations, specifically with the universalization of exchange. Whether or not their accounts of these relations reproduce a mythologizing narrative of a "fall" into economism (Smith makes this charge, and it is true enough in a narrow sense), that narrative still retains greater analytical accuracy than an analysis based on the simple opposi- tion between utilitarianism and anti-utilitarianism. These terms are entirely inade- quate in any case to grasp the real historical differences between so-called primitive and modern economies. On the former, see for example, Marshall Sahlins, Stone Age Economics (New York: Aldine, 1972): "Intergroup exchange does not simply answer to the 'moral purpose' of making friends. But whatever the intent and how- ever utilitarian, it will not do to make enemies. Every transaction, as we already know, is necessarily a social strategy. . . . As it happens, the safe and sane proce- dure is not just measure-for-measure, a reciprocity precisely balanced. The most tactful strategy is economic good measure, a generous return relative to what has been received, of which there can be no complaints. One remarks in these inter- group encounters a tendency to overreciprocate. . . . " (303). The practice of equal exchange produces a very different social world than the practice of overreciproca- tion, whether or not one chooses to idealize the latter. Whatever deficiencies char- acterize the theories of Bataille and Baudrillard (and let us grant deficiencies), surely the interest of their work does not lie in whether they have adopted a position which is, in Smith's terms, the correct philosophical position. Bataille and Baudrillard are less interested in the philosophical issue which exercises Smith than they are in pro- ducing a critique of the culture of capitalism. For the same reason I would suggest that there is somewhat less in common between Smith's work and Pierre Bourdieu's than may at first appear. It would be a serious misrepresentation of Bourdieu's ar- gument to claim that he is a "relativist," since he is never averse to representing objective social relations. The method of his "reflexive sociology" is to "objectify more completely one's objective and subjective relation to the object" (The Logic of Practice, 1). But this formulation already takes us into quite a different universe of discourse than the "objective/subjective" opposition Bourdieu calls "ruinous" and which seems to dominate thinking about the social in American discourse. For Bourdieu's critique of utilitarianism, see his In Other Words: Essays Towards a Re- flexive Sociology, trans. Matthew Adamson (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990), p. 108.” (381)
“37See Roy Porter, English Society in the Eighteenth Century (New York: Penguin Books, 1982): "De Saussure, for example, was amazed that artisans-even, he claimed, shoe-blacks-lounged about browsing the papers in London coffee houses. Pastor Moritz found his London landlady read Milton and other classics of English literature: 'The English national authors are in all hands, and read by all people, of which the innumerable editions they have gone through are a sufficient proof'" (239).” (382)

“the needs of the specialist audience that has formed ESTC’s main constituency in the past and may reasonably be expected to continue as such: the explorers in the field who need detailed maps. In my task of mediating between the file and its users, I find that these people approach early books with questions regarding one or both of two broad topics: intellectual content and physical characteristics, the latter including the location of copies,” with most interested in “the physicality of books.” (Tabor 369)
“When everything is working right, as it does in ESTC more often than not, the bibliographical description is completely accurate as far as it attempts to go, and variations in the matched copies can be reliably determined by the presence or absence of copy-specific notes. If anything happens to disturb the links between the description and its attached holdings, including errors committed in the course of creating the description, the record gets broken and starts telling lies about physical copies or, worse, about the ideal copy” (Tabor 370)

            <Text>In the following chapters, this dissertation weaves together an exploration of 1790s literature with an exploration of contemporary digital resources. As described in more detail above, chapter two uses Charlotte Smith to introduce the core differences between the databases under consideration, and to examine our conceptions of editions and reprinting. Chapter three uses Mary Robinson, whose printed output is expected to be largely similar in bibliographic terms to Smith’s (that is, they both consist of a large number of publications in a wide range of genres, which were successful enough to sustain a career as a writer), to examine questions about authorship and reception. Chapter four introduces an author who provides a contrast to both Smith and Robinson by producing a small number of titles in only one genre, Ann Radcliffe, prompting deeper inquiry into print runs and reviews, to develop richer metrics for “popularity” or “importance.” Chapter five introduces another contrasting author, of the opposing type, Hannah More, whose large number of publications at varied price points presents a technical challenge for the tools I have developed, and also a theoretical challenge for the concepts of literature I explore. A brief conclusion synthesizes my findings on these four authors, and presents my assessment of how they relate to 1790s literature as a whole.</Text>

            <Text>HathiTrust’s success in acquiring scholarly capital stands in interesting contrast with Project Gutenberg’s continued lack of cachet. Project Gutenberg is used in research with similar frequency to Google Books’ n-gram tool, but scholars often mention Project Gutenberg with a note of apology for not having found a better source. Its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its actual use and utility, likely, I argue, because its organizing principles are the ‘unserious’ ones of popularity and pleasure. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. This criteria might not render Project Gutenberg more useful for scholarly work but, it nonetheless narrows its selection substantially. Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but an order of magnitude fewer than its more-voracious potential competitors. In taking Project Gutenberg seriously as a collection of texts, I seek to explore the extent to which its reputation as “unreliable” may or may not be deserved.</Text>

            <Text>The recent quantitative turn in literary studies has reminded us of the breadth and variety of the literary field of the past. In so doing, however, it has necessarily levelled out the felt distinctions between various texts, and so risks working against the very sort of literary history that its new vistas promise: one which does justice to the workings of form across time and space. In particular, the presumptive interchangeability of texts that is required to put them into a series susceptible to quantitative analysis ignores the massively different footprint left by commercially successful (and socially canonical) texts as we move beyond their moment of initial publication. Evelina, for example, may have been just another novel of 1778 when it first appeared, but it loomed far above all other productions of that year a decade later (or anywhere beyond the metropole). Such footprints, I argue, changed the significance of their texts’ form, making it seem richer, thicker, more resonant or definitive—perhaps, for some, more stifling or oppressive—than that of their apparently similar but less successful counterparts.</Text>

            <Text>Radcliffe’s biography, too, is short. Radcliffe never cultivated a public literary persona, which itself led to the development of a mythos of her seclusion. Almost all biographical information comes from Thomas Noon Talfourd’s 1826 “Memoir of Radcliffe,” written in close consultation with Ann Radcliffe’s husband William. Radcliffe kept extensive journals, which Talfourd occasionally extracts, but her manuscripts were all destroyed shortly after her death, with the exception of forty-two pages of her commonplace book from near the end of her life, and a two-sentence letter to a Miss Williamson (Rogers 2). Deborah Rogers’s 1996 Ann Radcliffe: A Bio-Bibliography, the first to examine the commonplace book, remains the best account of Radcliffe’s life and major works. Some simple facts are known. She was born in London on July 9 1763, the only child of Ann Oates Ward and William Ward, a haberdasher who later managed a china shop. Both of her parents were close to their slightly more illustrious relatives, and encouraged an old-fashioned sense of gentility in their daughter (Rogers 3). Radcliffe was married in 1786 at age 23, to William Radcliffe, “a hardworking Oxford law graduate who became part-editor and owner of The English Chronicle” (Facer). Unlike Smith’s and Robinson’s husbands, William Radcliffe appears to have used the household’s funds fairly responsibly, though when Ann Radcliffe’s mother died, one stipulation of her will was that Ann’s inheritance not be used to pay any of William’s debts. Certainly, William Radcliffe promoted the image of himself as a nurturing helpmeet to his wife: in the ‘origin story’ of Ann Radcliffe’s writing which Talfourd writes based on William’s descriptions, Talfourd credits William with encouraging his wife’s shy talents. Facer says, “He often came home late and in order to occupy her time, Radcliffe began to write, reading aloud the lines she had written during the day on his return” (Facer). Given how many critics emphasize Radcliffe’s obvious responsiveness to reviews — each novel directly altering the aspects most criticized in the previous — her writing seems not to have been entirely an idle amusement to pass long hours. Her six major publications appeared rapidly between 1789 and 1797. In 1798, Radcliffe’s father died, leaving some of his property to Radcliffe, some to her mother, and a small amount to William himself should he outlive his wife (Rogers 11). In 1800, Radcliffe’s mother died as well, leaving her property to Radcliffe on the condition that nothing be left to William and none of the money be used to pay William’s debts (Rogers 11-12). In 1802, Radcliffe wrote, but did not publish, Gaston de Blondville, her last major work of writing. Radcliffe spent the second half of her life enjoying the domestic retirement praised within her novels, sometimes travelling within England with her husband. She died in 1823, age 58.</Text>
            <Comments>That Radcliffe lived another twenty-six years after the publication of The Italian with no further works is a fact which has apparently demanded explanation since the eighteenth century. “In the total absence of documentation, contemporaries were willing to believe, presumably because she was the reserved (female) author of Gothics, that Radcliffe was insane. … So reticent and self-effacing was Radcliffe that she never corrected rumors of her death or madness” (Rogers 13). Her husband, however, was interested in countering these rumours, and after her death in 1823 publicized a report from her doctor unequivocally stating that she had died of asthma and that her “mind was perfect in its reasoning powers (E131 104)” (Rogers 20)[ cite the original], suggesting instead that Radcliffe had withdrawn from publication after her inheritance made the increased income no longer important to maintain the luxuries of her life. Scholars largely accept this financial explanation, and add to it the explanation that Radcliffe had always been a fundamentally shy person who found public criticism of her writing distressing. Although her works were widely praised, they received so much attention that inevitably there were also critiques, and she may have wanted to remain distant from “the parodies as well as the many inferior imitations of her work” (Rogers 13).</Comments>

            <Title>Suarez ESTC</Title>
            <Text>WHO SAID THIS ABOUT THIS WORK? “This article should be required reading for those trying to use the ESTC for bibliometric purposes.” — Probably Karian??
Suarez provides an analysis of genre, place of publication, format, length (in sheets), and reprints.
I tender a preliminary analysis of the surviving record of eighteenth-century imprints in Britain and Ireland based on an ordered sampling of the English short-title catalogue (39)
Among the problems one encounters in using the ESTC for data collection and analysis is that it is not a stable database, but rather is constantly growing and changing as it is updated and subject to improvements, additions and corrections.5 The data in this study were collected between 2002 and 2004; while every effort has been made to control for the shifting nature of the database, such accommodations have not always been possible, especially since neither corrections nor / additions to the ESTC are marked as new.6 (At times, one may feel rather like Walter Shandy compiling the Tristapaedia.) (39-40)
Regrettably, although this volume of The Cambridge history of the book in Britain ends in 1830, it is not possible to perform a similarly comprehensive analysis for the first decades of the nineteenth century because we have no equivalent bibliographical control for this period. The nineteenth century short-title catalogue is based on the holdings of a far more limited number of libraries than is the ESTC, and is especially weak in provincial publishing at a time when such publications were increasingly important to local and regional markets.8 Even adding records from Copac ® and the Online Computer Library Centre’s WorldCat would not produce a bibliography with coverage comparable to the ESTC. Other attempts at providing a more thorough conspectus of imprints for the nineteenth century, although valuable, similarly do not have the comprehensive qualities of the ESTC. (40)
One crucial caveat should be considered at the outset: the Eighteenth-century short-title catalogue, as it was, and the English short-title catalogue, as it is now – coverage having been extended retrospectively to the mid-fifteenth century – only records bibliographic information about surviving books.10 After a careful study of book advertisements, inventories and bibliographies, it seems to this investigator that, excluding jobbing and newspaper printing, as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701–1800 has not been incorporated into the ESTC.11 In other words, for up to 10 per cent of the editions printed in the eighteenth century, not a single copy is known to survive. (40)
“These cover all imprints and significant bibliographical variants of books published in the British Isles and Great Britain’s colonial territories (with the addition of the United States of America, 1776–1800) in any language; books published in English, Irish, Gaelic or Welsh elsewhere in the world (for example, the Low Countries, France, Germany); and any imprint falsely claiming to be from London.” (41)
“Lacking the resources to conduct a detailed analysis of the entire ESTC from 1701 to 1800, I have resorted to sampling. Electing to examine all eighteenth-century records that appear in years ending in three – 1703, 1713, 1723 and so on – I have sought to avoid a number of cohort effects, most especially the cumulation of indeterminate records into years ending in ‘0’ or ‘1’ and, to a lesser degree, ‘5’.14 A weakness of many statistical studies of union catalogues is that they do not take this problem into account; one investigation found that nearly one-fifth of all imprints grouped in a given year, 1701, were assigned either by ‘estimation’ / or by ‘internal evidence’ – that is, without the year appearing in an imprint.15 ESTC lumps undated items into the nearest year ending in ‘0’ or ‘5’, so that ‘the peaks in production in such years are therefore to some extent the result of cataloguing practice, rather than increased real output’. “ (41-2)
“In order to determine the number of relevant imprints for analysis, the protocol for this study has been to examine every record in a given year, first sifting out all records that are geographically irrelevant – those coming from the Continent and the American colonies, for example. I have counted in my sample all those records originating in England, Scotland, Wales and, perhaps controversially, Ireland. “ (42)
“p.6: Inspecting and hand-counting individual records has the advantage of allowing the bibliographer to make careful discriminations, even as it introduces a degree of subjectivity (to say nothing of human error) and, hence, guarantees the irreproducibility of exact results. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019” (42)

p.7: the number of titles per annum exhibits a remarkable rise from a low of 1,744 per annum in 1723 to 6,801 in 1793, an increase of 390 per cent.21 Perhaps surprisingly, the year with the fewest number of imprints is not 1703 but 1723, a fact most probably accounted for by the volatility and instability of financial markets in London, and indeed elsewhere, following the South Sea Bubble financial crisis of 1720. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019 (43)
“It is important to bear in mind that these statistics merely represent numbers of imprints; they do not measure productive output per se because they take into consideration neither sheet counts nor edition quantities. Counting imprints is a deeply flawed way to measure output (to say nothing of produc- tive capacity). The only way, really, to establish an accurate picture is to undertake a sheet count.25 Yet, such a grand analysis simply was not tractable for an investigation using aggregate data from more than 34,000 records – le mieux est l’ennemi du bien.26 “ (44)
“This information was acquired by examining every record for information pertinent to five principal categories: (1) genre, (2) place of publication, (3) bibliographical format, (4) length (in sheets) and (5) reprints and/or repeat publications. “ (44)
“Although sets of protocols for each of these categories were / developed and strictly adhered to, there still is an inescapable element of subjective judgement in this study. In formulating and carrying out this investigation’s design, I have tried to eliminate arbitrariness wherever possible. In the case of genre, for example, where a definitive category could not be determined, the record simply was not counted, rather than make an arbitrary judgement.30 So too, with respect to bibliographical format: if the information available would not allow for a definitive determination, then no entry for that record was tabulated in the format category.31 Nevertheless, such protocols do not free an investigation such as this from the fact that many decisions are perforce made subjectively – and that thousands of such judgements are required. Thus, the results of this study are repeatable, but not exactly so.” (44-45)

“p.9:  I have endeavoured to fashion them in ways that would have been both intelligible to the eighteenth-century ‘common reader’ -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019” (45)
“Examining the category ‘politics, government and law’ … the number of titles more than triples from 1703 / to 1793, but stays essentially the same in terms of its ratio to the whole for each year. … among the categories I have examined, politics, government and law is the most consistent.” (46-7)
“The ‘medicine, mathematics and science’ group is represented by fewer than 50 titles in 1713 (70 titles in 1703); these numbers comprise approximately 2 per cent of the total productive output of the book trade. By 1783, however, that number has increased to 210, or 7 per cent of all records for that year. The 223 titles in 1793 represent a decrease to about 4.4 per cent of the total, but this is probably because of a sharp increase in provincial publishing, which is less likely to produce scientific and mathematical books that often require detailed illustrations and/or complex typesetting. An upward trend in medicine, math- ematics and science publications is clear, and felicitously in accord with our notions about the Enlightenment and its consequent dissemination of scien- tific ideas.33” (47)
“Just as the eighteenth century is a period of intellectual revolution, so too – and indeed no less – is it a time when the financial infrastructure of England and Scotland radically changes.34 It is somewhat surprising, therefore, to note a slight downward trend in the ratio of ‘business and finance’ books to the total output of the trade 1703–53, during which time such titles comprise just 5 per cent of the total. Yet, this trend is markedly reversed from 1763 to 1793, years that exhibit steady rises in both the number and proportion of titles – culmi- nating in 16 per cent of the total recorded for 1793 – and concomitant growth in provincial and London banking, the London stock and money markets, turnpike and other local trusts, joint-stock companies, and industrial investment.35 “ (47)
“By far the most important publishing category at the start of the century is ‘religion, philosophy and ethics’. In 1703, 34 per cent of all titles published belonged to this group. Perhaps surprisingly – considering England’s Erastian state and the importance of books and publishing to religious culture in England, Scotland and Wales more generally – this class of titles exhibits a significant downward trend throughout the century, ending with just 16 per cent of the whole, despite a significant increase in the number of publications in the last decade of our sample. Of course, the number of published titles does / not decrease, but it declines as a proportion of the total. That business and finance publications should in the last decade of the century represent the same proportion of publications as religion, philosophy and ethics is highly surpris- ing and may give credence to then-contemporary worries about growing secularization and the need to effect a religious revival. Nevertheless, as John Barnard has established, such numbers cannot be taken wholly at face value because survival rates for certain kinds of religious publications are remarkably low. “ (47-8)
“The eighteenth century is, famously, the era of ‘the rise of the novel’. We know, for example, that Robinson Crusoe went through six editions of 1,000 copies each in just four months, that Pamela sold approximately 20,000 copies in fourteen months, and that 6,500 copies of Roderick Random came on the market in less than two years.37 Nevertheless, when we examine the numbers of titles published – taking no account of edition sizes – we realize what a small portion of the market fiction actually occupied.38 During the period 1703–53, fiction of all kinds never constitutes as much as 2 per cent of the market (by editions published, not numbers of copies). Even at its height in the eighteenth century, fiction publishing represents slightly less than 3.5 per cent of all surviving titles. This fact may lead some bibliographers and book historians to question the emphasis on fiction publishing that characterizes so much of the work in our field. When viewing fiction as a percentage of the broader category ‘literature, classics and belles-lettres’, throughout the century, novel publishing never makes up more than a quarter of this category and, in 1743, is only around 10 per cent of the total. “ (48) — the lesson about fiction, I think, is that it is notable in the number of copies per title, rather than the number of titles
“p.12: Because their survival rates are so notoriously poor, ‘education and children’s books’ are especially problematic categories for bibliometric analysis. -- Highlighted Jun 25, 2019” (48) “It seems highly implausible, espe- cially in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, that education and children’s books should never exceed more than 120 per annum, or a high of approximately 3.75 per cent of the total annual output. Although it is true that sometimes the most interesting and important results in an investigation are counter-intuitive, in this instance our knowledge about survival rates strongly suggests that the data for this publishing category are so far off the mark as to be almost completely unreliable.41” (49)
“In much the same vein, when we examine the group of titles belonging to ‘agriculture, almanacs and practical matters’, it seems almost impossible to believe that such books, even if we are only counting titles and not edition quantities, never reached as much as 3.5 per cent of the total annual output, and were so constrained as never to exceed more than 108 editions per annum. Again, the answer lies in the fact that, like school-books and children’s books, the editions in this category are more than usually subject to stochastic pro- cesses.” (49) “Ackers records print runs of between 5,000 and 6,500 for editions dated 1737–47 (after which we have no records), making a total of / 64,000 copies of which only two – one each in 1741 and 1747 – are represented in ESTC, a survival rate of 1:32,000.” (49-50)

Book Formats

“The answer lies, in part, in the disproportionately high survival rates of large-format books. As Roger Stoddard’s Law reminds us, ‘Bigger books linger longer; little books last least.’70 Folios and, to a lesser extent, quartos tend to persist; octavos and duodecimos – not only because of their size, but also because of the ways they are read and used – commonly perish.” (57) “Folios for Greek and Latin classics, patristic authors, important works of divinity and display bibles were far more likely to be preserved than octavo or duodecimo books whose very size is a bibliographical code suggesting that they are of lesser importance.” (58) “Thus, although randomness certainly plays its part, not all books have an equal chance of survival; format and genre are highly determinative factors.” (58)
— This is a place where “exclusion” does come into play; these lesser works are excluded from contemporary archives/databases because of their format, which itself was not random but tied to social identity

            <Text>“My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-'A little child, dear brother Jim,' —I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jim.” (WW)

And it’s even an IN JOKE, and he uses the stanza just as Coleridge wrote it, deleting the joke without replacing it with anything!! This is not transcendent inspiration and individual genius. (He had long left behind the mountain and the girl when he wrote; he was thinking about tea time!)

            <Text>The Early Novels Database (END) project generates high-quality metadata about novels published between 1660 and 1850 in order to make early works of fiction more available to both traditional and computational modes of humanistic study. By uniting twenty-first-century database and search technologies with the sensibility of eighteenth-century indexing practices, END creates several innovative access points to a dataset that currently includes over two thousand richly detailed records. END metadata records and encodes information about how early novels instruct readers about themselves, carefully noting prefaces, introductions, and dedications; tables of contents and indexes; full titles and footnotes buried deep within the text. Each record includes both discursive descriptions of copy-specific information and codified languages that enable nimble search.  
END is a collaborative, multi-institutional project based at the University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College. Begun in 2009 by co-PIs Rachel Buurma, Associate Professor of English Literature at Swarthmore, and Jon Shaw, Director of Logistics and Access Services at Penn Libraries, the END project has expanded to include faculty, staff, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from both institutions, as well as undergraduate researchers from Penn, the Tri-College Consortium (Swarthmore, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr), and LACOL (Liberal Arts Consortium for Online Learning) member institutions.  
While most END cataloging to date has been based at Penn Libraries’ Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, which has strong holdings in British and American fiction of the long eighteenth century, END has also cataloged early novels at a number of Philadelphia-area repositories (the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach Museum and Library, the Swarthmore Libraries Rare Book Room, and Bryn Mawr College Special Collections) as well as the Fales Library at New York University.</Text>

Broken records
“A broken record occurs when information added to a record has not been checked against the copies already listed under that record” (Karian 285)

Inaccurate dates
‘The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records—for example, everything from 1720—there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720” (Karian 291)

“only records bibliographic information about surviving books … After a careful study of book advertisements, inventories and bibliographies, it seems to this investigator that, excluding jobbing and newspaper printing, as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701–1800 has not been incorporated into the ESTC.11 In other words, for up to 10 per cent of the editions printed in the eighteenth century, not a single copy is known to survive.” (Suarez 40)</Text>

Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren’t likely to be fully useful.

            <Text>Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. My design praxis is informed by the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments. Neither Tufte nor Cairo is a scholar of media studies; rather, they are professional practitioners of ‘data visualization’ who reflect critically on the assumptions of their work. Tufte’s work primarily strives to correct badly-designed data visualizations, and the dangerous decisions that bad design can lead people to. His most famous example is an analysis of the engineers’ report at NASA which led to the ill-fated launch of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986: as his extensive visual analysis argues, the engineers (untrained in graphic design) unintentionally obfuscated crucial information about the day’s launch conditions. The poorly-designed graphics these engineers produced made the launch appear low risk to their superiors; despite the engineers’ strong warnings, their verbal argument was disregarded in favor of their accidental graphical argument. As Tufte demonstrates, a few simple alterations of their graphic design would have made it obvious that the day’s unprecedentedly low weather was extremely dangerous, and potentially averted disaster \cite{Tufte:2001vw}. Tufte’s six principles of design primarily seek to guide undertrained designers away from misleading themselves. Cairo, following on Tufte’s work from the perspective of an active journalist, more often turns his attention to successful designs which mislead their audiences intentionally. His forthcoming book, How Charts Lie, addresses the readers of infographics with insights into visual literacy \cite{Cairo:ikIksuMr}. His preceding book, The Truthful Art, addresses the creators of good-faith infographics with insights into visual manipulation \cite{Cairo:2016uv}. Cairo draws a distinction between “data visualization” and “infographics”: “an infographic tells the stories that its designer wants to explain, but a data visualization lets people build their own insights based on the evidence provided,” summarized more succinctly as “infographics to explain, data visualizations to explore” \cite{Cairo:2014tl}. Using this terminology, my argument will proceed with infographics in the body of the dissertation as curated figures to support my argument, with fuller data visualizations available in Appendix C (“Data”) to allow further exploration. Following in both Tufte and Cairo’s footsteps, I conceive of the figures throughout this dissertation as rhetorical devices. In service of arguing honestly, therefore, my designs — in the body of the dissertation and in Appendix C — are accompanied by footnoted explanations of my design rationale. </Text>
            <Comments>I cite Tufte and Cairo as the thinkers whose design philosophies best accord with my own current understanding of the work and craft of persuasive data visualization, but my actual practical training as a graphic designer is indebted to Judith Galas, Sonia Davis Gutiérrez, and Tom Hapgood. 
 Tufte is careful not to blame the engineers for being better at engineering and systems analysis than they were at design: rather, this example shows that design is a skill that involves expertise; when designs matter, people with that expertise need to be involved.

            <Text>Instead, I look at a set of larger archives of more contested “scholarly” status: Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. Google Books may be the most infamous database of books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly-accurate metadata collected about them. These rapidly-scanned books are prone to unpredictable errors, including inaccurate dates, misspellings, duplicate copies, and inaccurate subject classifications — infamously, many books have “1899” assigned as their publication date because this date was used as a placeholder for “no date”. Nonetheless, Google Books is frequently used to study the prevalence of various “n-grams” (words or short phrases) over time, thanks to Google’s built-in tool. The tool is able to search books which are, for copyright restrictions, not available directly to readers, making it highly tempting for questions about contemporary language use.</Text>

            <Text>Flaws in the current canon debate

“two pervasive theoretical assumptions" implicit in the current canon debate: (6)
	1.	term ‘canon’ as replacement for ‘classics’ seeks to critique 'classics’, and treats the “traditional curriculum of literary texts" as equivalent to a closed and normative object akin to the scriptural canon. (6)
	2.	assumed similarity between exclusion (in which social minorities are excluded from power of political representation) and selection (by which some works are deemed canonical and others noncanonical). assumes that the solution is easy, add minorities to canon. (7)

A focus on “representation” as if literary representation was equivalent to political representation
	•	"The literary curriculum is precisely not the side of mass cultural production and consumption, but the critique of the canon has proceeded as though it were, as though canon formation were like the Academy Awards. ... in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site.” (8)

“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
Essentialist assumptions of liberal pluralism:
	•	“The sense in which a canonical author represents a dominant social group, or a noncanonical author a socially defined minority, is continuous with the sense in which the work is perceived to be immediately expressive of the author's experience as a representative member of some social group. ... The author returns in the critique of canon, not as the genius, but as the representative of a social identity.” (10)
	•	"it has seemed necessary to many progressive critics to present certain texts by minority authors as intrinsically noncanonical, as unassimilable to the traditional canon.” (9)

Current canon debate overlooks class
his post-Marxist critique is different from a liberal pluralist critique because he is "insisting on the theoretical and practical incommensurabiliy of the terms race, class, and gender: the modes of domination and exploitation specific to each of these socially defined minorities thus cannot be redressed by the _same_ strategy of representation.” (11)
"The fact of incommensurability explains why the revisionist critique of the canon has in practice been incapable of identifying 'noncanonical' works by lower-class writers who are not already identified by race or gender.” (14)

The “decline of the humanities” is the reduction of literature’s cultural capital

“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)
“If the liberal arts curriculum still survives as the preferred course of study in some elite institutions, this fact has everything to do with the class constituency of these institutions. …it is only those students who belong to the financially secure upper classes who do not feel compelled to acquire professional or technical knowledge as undergraduates." (46)
university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
The actual function of the canon

"The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
	•	"Within the history of canon formation we will always be able to discern the arrangement and rearrangement of (1) an institutional practice, or pedagogy; (2) a body of preserved and disseminated writings, or canon; and (3) a produced linguistic knowledge” (71)
	•	“Canonical texts, institutionally preserved and disseminated, constitute the paradigmatic basis of literary language, the guarantor at the lower educational levels of simple grammatical speech, the exemplar, at higher levels, of more expansive as well as more elite standards of linguistic use (stylistic or rhetorical rather than simply grammatical norms)” (68)
	•	“The school functions as a system of credentialization by which it produces a specific /relation/ to culture. That relation is different for different people, which is to say that it reproduces social relations." (56)
	•	“The educational institution performs the social function of systematically regulating the practices of reading and writing by governing access to the means of literary production as well as to the means of consumption (the knowledge required to read historical works)." (19)
Our current canon creates ‘literary language’ as the mark of distinction
	•	“while the standard or 'common' language seems to efface social stratification by making language itself the vehicle of common national identity, the 'literary’ language reinstates at another level a linguistic difference by which the upper classes can continue to mark their cultural distinction.” (78)
	•	the language taught in composition classes “is employed in its place, the ‘office.’ It is not 'everyday' language.” (79), and “its production bypasses the older literary syllabus altogether.” (79)
	•	“If the term 'literature' can be retained to indicate a transhistorical phenomenon at all, it would have to be defined as the canonical genres of writing, whatever these genres happen to be in any particular time or place, and whatever name may have been given to them collectively. We are speaking, then, of certain genres of writing which become paradigmatic for a socially differentiated speech." (69)

Where canons come from

It’s not the “exclusion” hypothesis
	•	"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the actively excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)
	•	“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon.” (16)
	•	“The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” (15) — yes: and the presence of women in a genre generally made it seem to be ephemeral rather than serious… which isn't QUITE exclusion, but also doesn't seem like it's what Guillory is noting
	•	"the historical process of canon formation, even or especially at the moment of institutional judgment, is too complex to be reduced to determination by the single factor of the social identity of the author” (17) gender may contribute somewhat to the reception of a given author, but it cannot in itself *explain* canonical/noncanonical status
Canons are selected
	•	“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)
	•	"Anyone who studies historical literatures knows that the archive contains an indefinite number of works of manifest cultural interest and accomplishment. While these works might be regarded as 'noncanonical' in some pedagogic contexts -- for example, the context of the ‘great works’ survey -- their noncanonical status is not necessarily equivalent in anyone's judgment to a zero-degree of interest or value.” (30)
	•	“Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To contend otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
Canons are made from syllabi
	•	"So far from being the case that the canon determines the syllabus in the simple sense that the syllabus is constrained to select only from canonical works, it is much more historically accurate to say that the syllabus posits the existence of the canon as its imaginary totality.” (31)
	•	the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
	•	revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
	•	revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)

How to “open” the canon

Must necessarily modernize it
	•	“the current critique of the canon both discovers, and misrepresents, the obvious fact that the older the literature, the less likely it will be that texts by socially defined minorities exist in sufficient numbers to produce a 'representative' canon" (15) —  but is this ACTUALLY true??
	•	“Obviously in order to ‘open' this canon, one would have to modernize it, to displace the preponderance of works from earlier to later. And there are of course many good reasons to do so. The pressure to modernize the curriculum has succeeded again and again” (32)
	•	"The fact that we no longer read these [classical] works in Greek or Latin, or that we read far fewer classical Greek or Latin works than students of premodern school systems, represents a real loss; but this loss must be reckoned as the price of the /integration/ of these works into a modern curriculum. The inevitable loss of older works in any humanities curriculum…is the result, as we have observed, of the /absolute/ accumulation of cultural works.” (51)
Present “minority works” as valuable literary history, not “representation” or subversion
	•	“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works [by minorities] because they are important and significant cultural works. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
But really, the goal is to address unequal access to cultural capital
	•	"A politically effective critique of literary education would be better served now by discarding the problematic of representation for a problematic whose object is the systematic constitution and distribution of cultural capital. For if social groups now imagine that they are too different to speak the same language, or to be represented by the same cultural works in the schools, they are nevertheless always exchanging the same currency, even in the symbolic form of cultural capital.” (82)

Chapter one “argues that there can be no /general/ theory of canon formation that would predict or account for the canonization of any particular work, without specifying first the unique historical conditions of that work's production and reception. Neither the social identity of the author for the work's proclaimed or tacit ideological messages definitively explain canonical status. If this were not true, ideologically heterodox works would never achieve canonicity, nor would writing produced by any member of a socially defined minority.” (85) It's the “task of the school, not of works themselves" to assimilate a range of works. (85)

“The preliminary remarks on the question of value in Chapter 1 argue that the process of canon formation cannot be reduced to acts of evaluation in the simple sense of affirming or rejecting the specific values assumed to be expressed in a literary work. … the institution which is the historical site of these evaluative acts--the school--subordinates specific values expressed in works to the social functions and institutional aims of the school itself. It is only when presented as canonical, as the cultural capital of the schools, that individual literary works can be made to serve the school's social function of regulating access to these forms of capital.” (269)</Text>

            <Text>Duckling, Louise. “‘Tell My Name to Distant Ages’: The Literary Fate of Charlotte Smith.” Charlotte Smith in British Romanticism, edited by Jacqueline Labbe. Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2008, pp. 203-217.

“During her lifetime Charlotte Smith was a literary celebrity: her Elegiac Sonnets and Other Poems (1784) were continuously reprinted and wifely emulated. She was a popular and prolific author, excelling in a series of novels, collections of verse and translations. Smith’s high volume of output, in a range of genres, reflects the deepening financial crisis that she was working to alleviate.” (203)

“Smith aspired to a place in posterity, but her contemporary success failed to secure her a place within the newly-emerging national canon. Whilst the absence of women poets from our literary histories has been a ubiquitous complaint, Smith was not entirely forgotten: her contribution was assessed in a variety of nineteenth-century anthologies, dictionaries and celebrations of ‘lost’ female talent. This essay will evaluate Charlotte Smith within these publications to reveal her colourful fate in posterity.” (203)

“Smith’s place in history is strongly influenced by the nature of her contemporary popularity, and in particular by her attractive public image.” (203) — attractive even though she was sometimes bitter and sarcastic in prefaces; her distress outweighed this and she still garnered sympathy (204)
Her marketing propaganda (herself as pitiable object of sympathy, rather than as master artist) became historical legacy. “This view would become deeply entrenched in the nineteenth century, when the cults of motherhood and the poetess were in ascendancy.” (204)

“Smith was excluded from Housman’s A Collection of English Sonnets (1835) on the grounds that her sonnets were ‘mawkish effusions’.” (205)

“Charlotte Smith’s popularity had helped to fuel a craze for sonnet writing, with her particular brand of sonnet being tirelessly imitated in the 1780s and 1790s. Smith’s reputation clearly suffered as a result of her association with this saturated, devalued, and feminized market.” (205)

“As Mary Poovey has argued, the ultimate effect of the revolutionary decade was to set women on their journey towards the ‘Victorian pedestal’, as increasingly idealized imaged of femininity took hold: female artists were expected to embody purity and goodness in their art and in their lives. Concurrently, women writers were being marginalized by what Gary Kelly has described as a ‘remasculinization’ of literature and culture.” (208) Smith stopped being anthologized as a poet, and entered anthologies as a poetess.
Brydges and Barbauld anthologize/praise Smith as an artist in a mixed-gender field 1808-1810 (though still in gendered terms). This shifts: Dyce (1825) and Rowton (1848) and Bethune (1848) and Adams (1857) anthologize in separate women-only collections, praising both her art and her life. Women anthologize her differently: Elwood (1843), Williams (1861), and Kavanagh (1862) see more literary importance.
“From a critical perspective, Charlotte Smith lost intellectual ground by the end of the nineteenth century, but women’s poetry was still a commercial venture and her poems frequently appeared in popular anthologies.” (216). But Robertson’s 1883 poetesses anthology dismisses the poetry as unpleasant to read, even though Smith was admirable.

More recent critical history:
“In the early twentieth century, critical accounts focused on Smith’s contributions to the novel. In 1913, Saintsbury believed Smith was ‘something of a person in herself, but less of a figure in history, because she neither innovates nor does old things consummately.’ Even the first extensive study of Smith by Florence Hilbish, whilst highlighting many areas of innovation, arrived at the conclusion that she produced ‘little strikingly original’ material … the twentieth century was not yet ready to truly appreciate Charlotte Smith. This is evident in Ernest Bernbaum’s / indifferent review of Hilbish’s work, which concluded that ‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable.’” (Duckling 216-7)
“The feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s generated a surge of interest in women’s writing, predominantly focused on the novel. Simultaneously, a revived interest in the historical context of literature enabled Bishop Hunt to demonstrate the influence of Smith on Wordsworth in 1970, although Smith remained a minor poet. By the 1980s the situation was changing rapidly. Perhaps this is because, in many respects, the critical climate began to reflect the same cultural preoccupations of Smith’s own age: a fascination with recovering the poetry of the past, a market predisposed to female anthologies and biographies, and a feminist interest in the plight of the woman in history. Smith had maintained a place in the popular female histories and collections in the nineteenth century, and had begun to be taken seriously by the academy in the twentieth century. In the 1990s, however, Smith enjoyed a popularity matched only during her own lifetime, with three separate reprints of the Elegiac Sonnets appearing during that decade. With the scholarship of Stephen Curran, and the academic anthologies of Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, and Andrew Ashfield (amongst numerous others), Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism. This is most clearly exemplified in the recent appearance of Jacqueline Labbe’s monograph on Smith, which explores Smith’s work beyond the constraints of gender and establishes her as a major influence on Wordsworth. As our definitions of Romanticism have been radically redefined, Smith may have finally achieved the winning combination of popularity and posterity.” (Duckling 217)

The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics.

Ch 1:

For example, the broadsheet ballad ‘Millions be Free: A New Song, Tune—“To Anacreon in Heaven”’, part of the Bodleian ballad collection, was also printed in a less radical version as ‘An Ode on the Restoration, of Freedom to France’ in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in January 1793.30 The broadsheet version of this poem, ‘Millions be Free’, written in the context of the French decree of November 1792 offering ‘fraternity and assistance to all peoples who seek to recover their liberty’31 concludes each stanza by looking forward to the spread of revolutionary ideology with a variant of the couplet—‘While FRANCE rises up, and proclaims the DECREE, | That tears off our Chains, and bids MILLIONS BE FREE’. The ‘Ode’ ends each stanza with ‘That tears off their our chains, and bids millions be free’ (emphasis added), which like its title (‘An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France’) and certain subtle but significant changes in tenses, allows the poem to be read as a celebration of the Revolution in France without the broadsheet’s call for the future spread of revolutionary freedom, The ‘Ode’ version illustrates Michael Scrivener’s argument that ambiguity was a necessary feature of much of the radical verse published in newspapers and magazines, enabling a text to satisfy different factions or ‘sides’ (PR.28–9), whereas the anonymous broadsheet version was able to present a more direct and extreme message. As this suggests, texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration (PR 26). Much war poetry of the period has this dual status; many songs written for a specific occasion were republished in the poetry sections of newspapers and magazines, while new sets of words were published in the hope they would be adopted for such purposes or with the aim that the tune to which they were set would heighten their impact on the reader.32 (p. 10)

The interrelation of the two forms is well illustrated by the republication in the government-controlled newspaper The Star in December 1793 of David Garrick’s two (p.13) inscriptions written to accompany William Hogarth’s pair of prints, The Invasion39 These prints had been published in March 1756, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years War with France, and Garrick’s verses read like a collection, of the clichés of French and English national identity (p. 12-3)

The continued power of ‘The Dram’ during the wars is illustrated by the pro-war, patriotic parody of it. beginning ‘I love that drum’s inspiring sound’, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1804 (BWP 330). Like its republication of ‘The Drum’, the Cambridge Intelligencer’s publication of a sixteen-line extract from a poem by Bielby Porteous, who became Bishop of London in 1787, written when he was a student at Cambridge in 1759, shows how the anti-war sentiment of the opening years of the war drew on the eighteenth-century enlightenment critique of international conflict. Printed under the title ‘The Bishop of London’s Opinion on War’, the lines present a powerful critique of war as the product of kings’ ‘Ambitions’ (p. 16)

Though, probably written in 1791 prior to the outbreak of the war with France,72 Southey published ‘To Horror’ in. Poems (1797), where it becomes an important part of the anti-war strand of that volume (p.24)

 Written in 1797 and published in The Pleasures of Hope in 1799, ‘The Wounded Huzzar’ recounts the journey of ‘Fair Adelaide’ to the banks of the ‘dark-rolling Danube’ in search of her wounded husband, who dies in her arms (ll. 2, 1)77 Campbell removes the gory and gothic elements of Penrose’s original, employing a far more euphemistic language to describe war’s damage … and makes the passion of love and war equally important elements of his hero (p. 26)

Merry’s poem ‘The Wounded Soldier’, written circa 1795 and printed in The Spirit of the Public Journals in 1799, illustrates this fusion of war’s damage to the soldier and to the home in startling fashion (BWP, 242).118 (p. 41)

But the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott. (P. 53)

Ch 3

Southey’s poem was published in January 1799 and the evidence of his Common-Place Book suggests it was written shortly before this, though in later editions he dated it to Westbury 1798, which would mean it could have been written any time after June 1798.6 (p. 82)

            <Text>The specific experimentation undertaken in chapter two tests the basic assumptions and methods of my project. I identify what subset of Smith’s works each corpus contains, as a concrete example to compare their holdings overall. Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets, for example, are not included in the ECCO-TCP corpus (which is the one most often used for text mining research) — only Celestina and The Emigrants are included. Why these two texts? And what text mining research based on ECCO-TCP might have found slightly different answers if Smith’s sonnets had been included? As a related test of comparison between databases, for each database which provides access to the actual text of Smith’s works, I compare the textual similarity of Celestina and The Emigrants. What editorial choices are being made? How much worse is the OCR text than the transcribed text? Another key concept I will explore through Smith is the role of reprints. HathiTrust, for example, includes multiple editions of Elegiac Sonnets. How reliable and effective are its distinctions between editions? How do the databases I examine handle multiple editions of a single work? I am particularly interested in how reprints can be incorporated into our understanding of what literature is “of” a particular decade: what does it mean to think of Elegiac Sonnets, initially printed in the 1780s, as “1790s literature”? Finally, having surveyed my six databases with the help of Smith, I discuss the multiple “Smiths” which emerge, and what it means to attempt to unify her disparate works.</Text>

            <Text>The syllabus of “theory” is a new canon
	•	“Theory's suspension of the category of the literary, institutionalized as the inclusion of nonliterary works in its syllabus, might seem in a narrow sense more radical than a movement to open the canon to minority works that remain, after all, literary works" (176)
	•	“what unifies the syllabus which includes (among others) Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, or Nietzche, Freud, Saussure, and Heidegger, is the fact that these oeuvres can be taken to embody a discourse of mastery, which is always by definition an imitable discourse." (203)
	•	“The names which circulate as ‘theory' in this canonical sense are actually very few in number, much more restricted a list than that which constitutes ‘canonical' literary work. Furthermore the very canonical organization of these texts, their recategorization as 'theory', has the effect of neutralizing the generic, disciplinary, and ideological differences between them in much the same way that the literary canon tends to define all canonical literary texts as the embodiment of a single quality of 'literariness’.” (203)
	•	theory introduces to grad pedagogy "a syllabus whose symptomatic function is to signify precisely methodological 'rigor,' rather than the taste or discrimination which for so long determined the ideological protocols of literary criticism.” (260)

Theory addressing the irrelevance of literature
	•	“Althusser suggests that a symptomatic reading of a text reveals that the text provides an answer to a question which does not itself appear in the text.” (180) … de Man does ask “what is literature?” but the real question he answers (with “rhetoricism”) is "what shall replace literary criticism as it was formerly practiced, [ie] as the appreciative interpretation of the syllabus of 'literary’ works?” (180)
	•	“I will attempt to read this problem as the failure of de Manian theory (and theory in general) to function as anything other than an interim, imaginary solution to the new conditions of intellectual labor, conditions that will certainly require a thorough rethinking of what it is that literary critics do in the classroom and in their writing. In the meanwhile we can say that the reconstruction of criticism as a ‘technical' practice revealed the intrinsic inadequacy of the literary syllabus as the object of that intellectual labor; hence the ‘rigor' of theory had to be embodied not in literary works but in the philosophical or other nonliterary texts supplementing that syllabus. It is these works, the 'canon of theory,' which signify rigor." (181)
	•	"The larger question, for which I shall attempt to provide a properly sociological analysis in the latter part of this chapter, is why the literary critical profession should now require a canon which signifies in its totality a discourse of mastery, in addition to the traditional 'literary' canon, whose significance, as we shall see, is considerably altered by its interrelation with the theory-canon." (203)
	•	theory has become “work on a set of problems that concern all critics” (26), working on "the problem of 'specialization,' or the effects of the technobureaucratic organization of labor on the discipline of criticism" (261)
	•	grad seminars offer unique freedom for theory to appear, but “The indifference of university administrators to the graduate curriculum reflects less their respect for the traditional autonomy of the graduate teacher as it does an accurate estimation of the diminished significance of the literary curriculum in the context of the university’s perceived social function, the perceived demand for the knowledges it disseminates." (261)
	•	“the hegemony of that technobureaucratic organization of intellectual life which has rendered the literary curriculum socially marginal by transforming the university into the institution designed to produce a new class of technical/managerial specialists possessed of purely technical/managerial knowledge." (261)
	•	schools used to be tasked with "the impossible task of at once democratizing the distribution of knowledges and maintaining class distinctions" but now "the nation-state…no longer requires that a distinctive practice of … language identify a culturally homogenous bourgeoisie. That class has long since been replaced by a culturally heterogenous New Class” (263)
	•	“it is the absence of such a crucial social function which the professors of literature experience as powerlessness in the face of a political entity--the state--which they misrecognize as the source of disempowerment." (263)
	•	“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)

De Manian rigor
	•	rhetorical reading gets its rigor from its ability to produce readings that the reader doesn't want -- but "Let us consider the possibility that nothing is more desirable than that the conclusion of the reading be known in advance" (231)
	•	“The rigor of rhetorical reading is not by any means the rigor of an argument in which the knowledge produced at its conclusion can actually take the reader by surprise." (232)
	•	“The rigor of rhetorical reading is thus more rigor than a science requires: it is the rigor of a prescience, a foreknowledge.” (232)
	•	"As rhetorical reading's most overdetermined concept, rigor facilitates an imaginary reduction of the social totality to the structure of the trope, and it thus permits rhetorical reading to function as a political theory just by virtue of being no more than a theory of literature." (236)
	⁃	“If de Manian deconstruction authorizes no specific political practice, as its critics have been eager to claim, that is beside the point. We should do better to ask why a theory of literature (much less of trope) should imply a political practice." (236)
	⁃	deconstruction responded to an external demand (that the syllabus serve a political purpose) "by imposing a limit to curricular revision, a limit intended to preserve theory as literary theory." (237)

Master/disciple pedagogy and transference
	•	theory relies on "the charismatic persona of the master theorist"; theorists can be recognized as masters by the fact that they have disciples (179)
	⁃	“the institutional position of the master theorist, as the person in whom institutional and personal prestige is ‘blended,’ and in whom the concept of 'autonomy' is maximally overdetermined, was always a condition for the emergence of theory.” (155) 
	⁃	“The increasingly technobureaucratic organization of the professional field of literary criticism was a condition for the emergence of theory, which we can understand in retrospect as the reassertion of charismatic authority in the face of that technobureaucratic domination." (256)
	•	"If the institutional locus of canon formation is the school, and its instrumentality the syllabus, the social relation between teacher and student oddly effaces its institutional conditions in producing nothing less than a kind of love: first the love of the disciple for the master, and then the love for what the master teaches, his 'teaching,' and beyond that, as we shall see, a love for the very texts the master loves." (182)
	•	"By transferring the eros of the transference to the lesson, the transference itself will disappear; it will be terminated. ... And this is to say that nothing will remain of de Man in the lesson, that loving the lesson is not, finally, the same as loving de Man." (185)
	•	“Lacan expresses the problem of psychoanalytic theory's transmission as the thematic of the distinction between science and religion. What the theorist wants (but this is not yet equivalent to the 'desire of the analyst’) is the transmission of theory, that is, the solution to a problem in pedagogy. Whether or not a theory carries with it a claim to scientificity, its transmission would be better assured by its organization in the form of a science” (198)
	•	"the transference onto theory always misses its object, the positive content of theory, by cathecting in and behind that object the image of the master.” (201)
	•	De Man: "What de Man gains tactically by reducing all intersubjective relations to the possibility of cognitive (that is, linguistic) error is the total obliteration of the transference from the terrain of the discussion." (193)
	•	Lacan: Lacan's matheme: “By reducing transmission to a rote process the doctrine was supposed to escape a certain contingency of the transference, its constitutive ambivalence, its love-hate. But the reception of the matheme marked a greater investment in the transference than ever before, even as both master and disciple deferred to the impersonal form of the algorithm.” (202)
	•	“Lacan and de Man appear to set off resolutely on opposite theoretical directions, but ... they end up in the same place, the place of the ‘the subject who is supposed to know.’” (195)
	•	“the teaching of both de Man and Lacan attempts to account and compensate for the vicissitudes of transmission by attributing those vicissitudes to an epistemological defect of language, or by refusing in principle the possibility of the dissolution of the transference. The two positions amount in practice to the same thing." (202)

Summary of de Man
	•	de Man's "terminology produces certain discursive effects. These effects are (1) the conflation of linguistics with rhetoric; (2) the equation of literature with rhetoric; and (3) the reduction of rhetoric to trope." (208)
	•	end result of Early Modern concept of scientific truth creates the idea of "fiction”; in 18thC ”the category of the 'literary' could then be restricted to the fictional genres. The new generic system had to develop a conception of truth proper to its form and the theorization of this truth describes in the largest sense the project of 'Romantic' criticism" (214) … “it is by means of a return to rhetoric that the generic distinction between literary and non-literary texts can be reconceptualized as a linguistic distinction, the problem of 'literary language’” (214)
	•	de Man's reading is thematic; the use of 'tropes’  "permit the methodology to advertise itself as rigorously rhetorical or non-thematic” (227)
	•	for de Man “metaphor and metonymy mean necessity and chance” (227)
	•	“de Man's argument is that departments of literature have denied their institutional identity as departments; they have constructed an institutional self-image which devalues their own purely institutional functions. Against such institutionalized anti-institutionalism de Man proposes a thorough reinvestment in the form of the department, as the basic structural unit of the university.” which means no longer being 'large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter' but instead ‘much smaller units, dedicated to.. professional specialization’ (247)

            <Text>Also in the category of smaller and specialized archives is Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly work — its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its use and utility. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard, ‘unscholarly’ source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. It narrows the field substantially to exclude works which have either ceased to be broadly interesting (as in the case of most forgotten fiction), or which were never particularly interesting (as in the case of almanacs and tax codes). Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but nonetheless an order of magnitude fewer than its more-voracious potential competitors. And, like smaller specialized scholarly archives, Project Gutenberg has tailored its holdings to make it easy for readers to read, and quite difficult for its collection to be applied to any other use. By tailoring the structure of the archive itself to its specific materials, these collections are able to thoughtfully achieve their aims — but they also make it correspondingly difficult for users to achieve their own, different aims.</Text>
            <Comments>I have heard it quipped more than once in digital humanities gatherings that you always think you’re going to get your texts from somewhere else, but Project Gutenberg is where you’ll actually get them.

            <Text>	•	“The main tradition of literary and cultural history has been to consider the texts of those authors whose works have subsequently been regarded as the best or the most innovative in a chronological order of first publication. … In recent decades this parade model has been supplemented by studies which present the printed texts of a particular historical period as debating and negotiating with each other in a kind of open parliament with all the members participating and listening.” (2)

            <Text>Chapter 2 of this dissertation examines the works of Charlotte Smith across several digital corpora. Charlotte Smith is selected as a writer who was productive in multiple genres, only some of which may end up represented in corpora. Charlotte Smith’s literary career began with the publication of her volume of poetry Elegiac Sonnets, in 1784. This work is the one upon which much of Smith’s fame and prestige rested in the eighteenth century. A second edition of Elegiac Sonnets rapidly followed the first in the same year, with only slight amendments. The third and fourth editions of Elegiac Sonnets appeared in 1786, adding new poems. 1786 also saw the publication of Smith’s The Romance of Real Life, a translation of Les Causes Célèbres, her first foray into prose, which would occupy the major part of the next phase of her career. In 1788 she published her first original novel, Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle. 1789 begins this dissertation’s decade of interest, a period of intense productivity for Smith: she had at least one new publication almost every year from 1789-1799. In 1789, she published her second original novel, Ethelinde, or the Recluse of the Lake, and a fifth edition of Elegiac Sonnets. In 1791 she published Celestina, her third novel; in 1792, her fourth novel, Desmond, and a sixth edition of Elegiac Sonnets. Although Elegiac Sonnets continued to be reprinted, reaching its tenth edition in 1812, after this edition no further poems were added. Instead, her new poetry appeared in their own independent publications, and no longer took the form of sonnets. In 1793 she published The Emigrants, a poem in two volumes, as well as The Old Manor House, her fifth novel. In 1794, her sixth and seventh novels, The Wanderings of Warwick and The Banished Man. In 1795 she published her eighth novel, Montalbert, and began writing in a new genre with Rural Walks. With Rural Walks, Smith’s dominant genre again changed: having gone from a poet to a novelist, she now primarily published in a form which does not have a contemporary name: morally instructive natural history for “young persons.” 1796 saw the sequel to Rural Walks, Rambles Farther, as well as the novel Marchmont, and the poem A Narrative of the loss… of several ships. 1797 saw the eighth edition of Elegiac Sonnets, unchanged since the sixth. 1798 saw the novel The Young Philosopher, and more natural history for children in Minor Morals. In 1799, Smith tried her hand at theatre with What Is She?, a comedy — not a form she will revisit — and published the first two volumes of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer, an epistolary anthology of narratives. After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Smith continued to write at a slightly less frenetic pace. In 1800 she published three additional volumes of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer. In 1804, she published Conversations, Introducing Poetry, for children. In 1806, Smith published History of England, another work for young persons, and Smith herself died, age 55. The next year saw the posthumous publication of the poem Beachy Head and the work for young persons, The Natural History of Birds.</Text>

            <Title>ch 3 - gender, topics</Title>
            <Text>In chapter three, I intervene in these corpora with code which I have written myself. First, I seek to determine how many of the titles in each database are attributed to men, how many to women, and how many are unsigned or unattributable. I will consider both the authors listed on the title pages and the authors identified by the database itself, since these often differ. This experiment will rely on a small program which assigns a probable gender to each author name. One of the core questions of this dissertation, as discussed, is about the content of the works which are not preserved and distributed by the new structures of canonization which contemporary digital archives create. In this experiment, I ask pointedly: are men preferentially preserved? My second experiment in this chapter is related, as I seek to determine what kinds of writing are included in each corpus. I write a less-simple series of programs in order to make reasonable guesses at the contents of texts, using topic modelling. Topic modelling is a methodology used in computer science to group texts which discuss similar subject matter. It is designed for search engines, and relies on clustering related keywords. Topic modelling is usually applied to long texts: it was designed for news articles or web pages, but literary scholars often apply it to entire novels. Since my work is partly motivated by the unavailability of full digital texts, I apply it to just the title pages of works. In doing so, I take advantage of the eighteenth century’s distinctively rich title conventions. In most decades, a title would not offer enough information to contain multiple ‘topics,’ but in the eighteenth century, the title page doubled as an advertisement, trying to convey as much appealing information as possible about the work’s contents. Once I have created my topic models, I will use them to compare the prevalence of categories like plays, songs, prose romance, histories, poetry, political treatises, and other broad categories of writing. One advantage of using topic modelling, rather than classifying works by hand, is that the clusters of texts will emerge based on the eighteenth century vocabulary for genres. At this stage, however, I do not take any corpus as representative of the ‘true’ distribution of various genres in the eighteenth century print marketplace. Instead, I use these categories in conjunction with my previous identification of authorial gender, to ask: if there are differences in gender distribution between corpora, are they attributable to differences in the kinds of writing which each corpus preferentially preserves? That is to say, if men are over-represented in the smaller and richer corpora which have seen the greatest investment of scholarly resources, is this because those corpora primarily preserve male-dominated categories of writing? Or do they preferentially select male authors from categories which are not male-dominated at the larger scale?</Text>
            <Comments>The automatic attribution of a gender to a name is the sort of thing which would be untenable in a modern corpus, and which is uncomfortable even in the eighteenth century. However, my core question is about how gender is represented on title pages, as a visible component of print culture, rather than about the personal identity of any given author. In that limited context, it seems justifiable to say, for example, that a book attributed to ‘Charlotte Smith’ or ‘the authoress of The Romance of the Forest’ or ‘Mrs. Robinson’ advertises itself as being by a woman. I have been unable to find a first name in my eighteenth century corpora which cannot be assigned an unambiguous gender. Differences between the advertised author gender and what scholars have assigned in the database as the ‘actual’ author gender (as, for example, when Mary Robinson published as Mr. Robinson) will be discussed and theorized when they occur.
For example, a typical title in the English Short Title Catalogue for the decade is “The injustice and impolicy of the slave-trade, and of the slavery of the Africans: illustrated in a sermon preached before the Connecticut Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Persons Unlawfully Holden in Bondage, at their annual meeting in New-Haven, September 15, 1791. / By Jonathan Edwards, D.D. Pastor of a church in New-Haven. ; To which is added, A short sketch of the evidence for the abolition of the slave-trade, delivered before a committee of the British House of Commons.” The usefulness of this title, as an advertisement for (if not necessarily an accurate representative of!) the work’s content, I argue, presents an opportunity unique to the eighteenth century. The eighteenth century is often dismissed as unsuitable for computational distant reading because eighteenth century printed type produces very low-quality OCR transcripts — but a focus on OCR-based distant reading itself seems to me like a response to the poverty of paratextual material in later literature.
Of course, these title pages are not always accurate descriptions, since they might wish to mislead readers to encourage purchases. These disjunctions </Comments>

            <Text>“THE POPULARITY OF ENGLISH RENAISSANCE PRINTED PLAYS declined dramatically in 1997. For most of the twentieth century, scholars had asserted that plays were a successful portion of the book trade, yielding a predictable profit for publishers.” (1)
“Since 1997, however, Shakespeareans have tended to argue a position just the opposite of this received wisdom. Printed plays, it is now maintained, were “risky business ventures” in which publishers, who “in most cases had little or nothing to gain from playbooks,” were “understandably reluctant” to invest.” (1)

“This shift in scholarly thinking can be dated to Peter W. M. Blayney’s landmark article,“The Publication of Playbooks,” cited by all of the authors quoted above” (2)

“He argues instead that new plays“never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books,” comprising between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent of the entries in the ShortTitle Catalogue from 1583 to 1642.” (3)
“From 1583 to 1602, “only” 48 percent of first editions were reprinted within twenty-five years; from 1603 to 1622, the figure is just over 50 percent; from 1623 to 1642, less than 29 percent.17 “Fewer than 21 percent of the plays published in the sixty years under discussion reached a second edition inside nine years”; this / means, he argues, that “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years.” (3-4)

“Whereas much early-twentieth-century bibliographic scholarship was impressionistic and based on a priori assumptions about the popularity of printed drama, Blayney provides a detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays as evidence against the “myth” of the popularity of playbooks. But, like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books.” (4)

“popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (4)

“Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends. While the myth of piracy is false, the “myth” of playbook popularity happens to be true.” (4)
“Blayney judges best-sellers by total number of editions within twenty-five years of first publication” (4)
“as we will argue, the ShortTitle Catalogue (STC) in its entirety is far too broad to serve this function” (4)

“The criterion that brings us closest to consumer demand is the rate of reprinting of playbooks, since a publisher’s decision to reprint can usually be assumed to indicate both that the previous edition had sold out (or was about to sell out) and that the publisher anticipated continued demand for the book.” (5)
“Admittedly, reprint rates tell us neither the number of individual copies bought and sold nor the total capital invested in or profits earned from the sale of plays” (5)
“We can, though, estimate profitability, as we do later in the essay, by using sheet lengths as a gauge for comparing the likely profits of a typical playbook with those of other kinds of books. Used in conjunction with profitability estimates, market share, and total editions, reprint rates can provide our best indication of the kind of popularity in which most of us are interested—the popularity of books with customers.” (6)

“Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest. They turned a profit more reliably than most other types of books, and this profit would not have been paltry” (6)

“Figures 1 and 2 show that the trends in the publication of printed professional plays divide that market into six distinct periods:” (7)
1576–1597: an initial period of low production (48 first editions, 11 second-plus editions) 
1598–1613: a boom followed by sustained high production (129 first editions, 79 second-plus editions) 
1614–1628: a gradual contraction, with production levels generally still above those of 1576–1597 (31 first editions, 65 second-plus editions) 
1629–1640: a second boom (122 first editions, 84 second-plus editions) 1641–1649: a sharp contraction, with only one play published from 1643 to 1645 
(17 first editions, 10 second-plus editions) 1650–1660: an expansion to levels slightly above those of 1614–1628 (58 first editions, 27 second-plus editions) 
“as figure 1 indicates, this first extended boom was initially driven by a rapid increase in second editions, not new plays” (10)
“Further, more and more stationers started entering the market for printed professional drama. From 1600 to 1602, 71 percent of first editions were produced by stationers who had never previously published a single play. Before then, play publication had been concentrated among relatively few stationers, with stationers new to professional drama bringing out only 20 percent of the first editions printed from 1595 to 1597, and only 36 percent of those printed from 1598 to 1599. The boom thus resulted in a widening, not merely a deepening, of stationer interest in playbooks.” (10)

“The ensuing period of market contraction for printed plays underscores the relative independence of print from the stage.” (11)
“this steep decline is accounted for almost entirely by a plunge in first editions from 8.1 to 2.1 per year. Indeed, according to the extant archive, from 1626 to 1628 not a single new professional play reached print, the first time such a suspension of play publication had occurred since 1588. The publication of second-plus editions, by contrast, hardly changed at all, decreasing only slightly from 4.9 to 4.3 editions per year.” (12)
“Some combination of changes in both supply and demand probably underlies the contraction, but what both hypotheses reveal is the centrality of reprints to the market for printed drama.” (12)

“When we include second-plus editions, Shakespeare’s plays occupy an even larger share of the overall market (twenty-three of eighty playbooks, or 29 percent). Shakespeare’s closest competitors during this seven-year period lag far behind: Robert Greene (nine playbooks) and Christopher Marlowe (five playbooks). We should point out, however, that Shakespeare was named on only nine of these title pages, which is hardly surprising given that authors in general appeared on only 36 percent of all play title pages during this period.” (11)

“second-plus editions were an extremely safe investment, for they almost always sold well enough to be printed in yet another edition; from 1576 to 1625, a whopping 72 percent of second-plus editions were reprinted within twenty years” (12)
“Reprints, which were surely less dependent on theatrical popularity than first editions, formed the backbone of the trade in printed plays.” (13)

“However much the Jonson and Shakespeare folios may have elevated the cultural value of drama, they seem to have had little or no effect on its economic value. Instead, what created that economic value and finally established the market for printed drama was not these imposing folios but rather the more humble quarto reprints from the end of the 1590s.” (13)

“Once the market for printed professional plays had been created, just how significant was it? Blayney estimates that new plays accounted for 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent of all entries in the STC from 1583 to 1642.35 We would argue that these figures do not properly reflect the significance of playbooks in the book trade.” (13)
“by setting the number of plays against the total number of entries in the STC, Blayney’s figures compare apples and oranges. Although the STC presents the best picture we have of the mass of printed material circulating in early modern England, a fair number of entries, as Blayney himself notes, do not represent separate editions at all but are instead merely variant issues or states of a single edition.” (13)
“Blayney deals with playtexts, not playbooks, and so includes twenty-nine plays published only in collection and not as separate books.” (13)

“While all playbooks were “speculative,” meaning that publishers decided to invest in them based on their assessment of potential consumer demand, not all books carried this element of risk. When stationers produced state proclamations, visitation articles, or university act verses and theses—to take just a few frequent examples—they were not making decisions about the commercial viability of these items; rather, they were paid in advance and printed them on command.” (14)
“this question of speculation is crucial if we want to use market share to assess popularity” (14)
“we produced a sample of the STC from 1590 to 1640 by selecting six discrete years (1590, 1600, 1610, 1620, 1630, 1635) and examining every entry listed for those years, excluding variant issues and non-speculative books of the kinds discussed above” (14)
“79 percent are for speculative publications” (14)

“As the lower line on figure 3 shows, printed plays constituted a much larger market share than previously thought; indeed, in periods of expansion, that share was three times larger than Blayney’s figures show.” (14)
“in their peak years, professional plays made up 6.2 percent of the overall speculative market, or one in every sixteen speculative editions. While certainly not the dominant segment, playbooks were hardly marginal” (16)
“Figure 3 also confirms that changes in the market for plays were not simply responses to changes in the book trade as a whole; rather, the expansions and contractions in the total number of printed plays were also expansions and contractions in their market share” (16)

“these figures do not tell us the proportion of individual copies of printed plays among copies of all books, since we lack evidence for the press runs of most editions. Nor do they tell us the total capital invested in and revenue generated by playbooks compared to other classes of books.” (16)
“Without this evidence, we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books in early modern England, if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists or a publishing firm’s “bottom line.”” (16)

“It is nonetheless obvious that, in terms both of total copies sold and of total investment and profits, the dominant force in the early modern speculative book trade was a select group of titles protected by royal patents or by the English Stock monopoly. These include almanacs, Bibles, catechisms, and school books.” (16)
“While patented and monopolistic books comprise only about 11 percent of the total entries in our STC sample, that figure understates their importance, for not only were these books produced in greater press runs, but some, such as almanacs and primers, have higher loss rates as well.” (17)
“patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (17)
“Isolating the market for non-monopolistic books thus tells us more about stationers’ evaluations of uncertain demand than does an analysis that lumps together risky non-monopolistic books with constantly reprinted monopolistic titles.” (17)

“If we want to understand not which books were the most important financially to the book trade as a whole but rather how attractive playbooks were as investments, then we need to determine how often stationers chose to publish plays rather than other kinds of books available to them.” (17)

“Whether these figures seem high or low is to some degree a subjective measure. Both the “maximal” and the “minimal” market shares presented in figure 3 certainly suggest that playbooks were much more prevalent than recent scholarship has supposed, but whether they demonstrate the popularity of playbooks is a determination that can be made only after further studies produce the corresponding figures for other classes of books (poetry, travel, or medicine, for instance).” (18)
“we will compare playbooks to printed sermons, but without more such analyses, it is not possible to establish clearly the relative popularity of playbooks in terms of market share. What is certain, however, is that printed plays sold very well indeed compared to other kinds of books” (18)

“The problem, then, is not with these figures per se but with the fact that, because popularity is a relative concept, one cannot determine whether Blayney’s data indicate the relative unpopularity of playbooks (as he claims) or the relative popularity of playbooks, unless one knows how they compare to the reprint rates of other books.” (18)
“they were reprinted at more than twice the rate of speculative books in general (39.9 percent versus 18.1 percent)” (18)
“And these reprints were themselves extremely popular, with almost three-quarters of all second-plus editions reaching a further edition.” (20)
“Playbooks compare very well not only to a representative sample of all speculative books but also to the entire extant archive of one class of books, sermons in English, often considered one of the more successful segments of the early modern book trade” (21)

“judging by market share, sermons do indeed appear to have been more popular than playbooks” (21)
“During the period of their highest production (1606–1640), printed sermons averaged just over forty-two editions per year, comprising 9.8 percent of the speculative market (or 11.4 percent of the non-monopolistic speculative market), more than twice the market share of professional plays during their two highest periods.” (21)
“But if we assess sermons by reprint rates, their relative popularity begins to dim: 19.3 percent of sermons first printed from 1576 to 1625 were reprinted inside twenty years, almost exactly the rate for speculative books in general. Even during the period of their peak reprint rates—29.9 percent from 1591 to 1606—sermons were reprinted much less frequently than were professional plays.” (21)
“Figure 5 shows the percentage of all professional plays and sermons first printed from 1576 to 1625 that reached two editions, three editions, and so on through ten or more editions by 1660. At each level, playbooks outperform sermons” (22)
“In fact, playbooks were more likely to reach a third edition by 1660 (26.1 percent) than the average English sermon was to reach a second (20 percent).” (22)
“Therefore, unless the combined press runs of a play’s first two editions were regularly smaller than the press run of the first edition of a sermon (and this seems highly improbable), then the typical playbook must have sold more total individual copies than the typical sermon.” (22)

“Playbooks outperformed sermons partly because plays were, in one important sense, less ephemeral than sermons. If a sermon was not reprinted within five years of its initial publication, it was highly unlikely ever to be reprinted.” (22)
“playbooks were just as likely to be first reprinted after five years as within five years” (22)
“Plays not only repaid their publishers’ investments more quickly than other books, but they also remained profitable far longer.” (24)

“The reprint success of playbooks, however, may give rise to the question of why more weren’t published if they were such a good investment for stationers.” (24)
“an average of just under six per year—has nevertheless seemed quite a low number to most recent scholars” (24)

[Is it because they are too short to be able to turn enough profit to be worthwhile? no]
“The median (rather than the average) length of these 987 titles was only ten-and-ahalf sheets” (25)
“Because playbooks were fairly typical in length—and therefore in price and potential profits—and, at the same time, were far more likely to sell out than other books, many publishers must have found them attractive investments. In contrast to the low-cost, low-profit, higher-risk publications that recent scholarship has taken them to be, playbooks were in fact middling-cost, middling-profit, lower-risk publications—an appealing profile for speculators.” (25)

"Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate. Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more "popular”? After all, both sermons and playbooks seem to have been relatively popular compared to other kinds of books, but according to different criteria. For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different _structures of popularity_” (Farmer and Lesser, “Revisited”, 25-6)

“If the seeming paucity of playbooks cannot be attributed to low demand— either from consumers (judging by reprint rates) or from stationers (judging by their profit profile)—then perhaps we should investigate supply.” (25)
“early modern playing companies made their decisions based on their own economic interests, not on the interests of stationers” (26)
“Perhaps stationers would have published more plays had they been as plentiful as other texts.” (26)

“Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (26)
“Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”?” (27)
“For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (27)

“we turn briefly to the Caroline period, when the trade in playbooks, which had long functioned according to one structure of popularity, now fissured into two” (27)
“We are thus left with a seeming contradiction: if judged by reprint rates, plays seem to have become less popular in the Caroline period, yet according to two other indices of popularity—editions per year and market share—plays were at least as popular as ever.” (27)
“Reprint rates seem to have been depressed because of an unprecedented division between the structures of popularity for first and second-plus editions.” (27)
“in the Caroline period new plays were almost never reprinted, while second-plus editions continued to be reprinted at roughly the same rate” (28)
“The market for first editions was dominated by one group of publishers, and that for second-plus editions by a different group of publishers, with very little overlap” (28)
“The market for first editions seems to have been driven by customers’ desire for novelty, for the newest playbook in the stationer’s shop from the latest play performed in the theater” (28)
“The market for second-plus editions, on the other hand, depended on customers’ attachment to particular “classics,”” (28)

Methods
“STC Sample: We cannot assume that the “speculative rate” for our six-year STC sample (79 percent) automatically matches that for the entire fifty-one-year period of 1590 through 1640, so we must therefore acknowledge the potential margin of error, which in this case is ±1.4 percent.” (30)
“We have chosen for our STC sample six years—1590, 1600, 1610, 1620, 1630, and 1635—that, due to STC cataloguing practices, contain a higher than average number of entries with inferred dates” … “For these purposes, statistical tests demonstrate that entries with inferred dates are not inconsistent with all other entries in these years.” (30)

“Reprint Parameters:” “First, Blayney uses a twenty-five-year window for reprints, while we use a more conservative twenty-year window” “Second, he designates the year of publication as Year 1, while we count it as Year 0” “he has also included several university plays that we have not” “Blayney tracks plays first printed in collections separately from the collection as a whole” (31)
“whereas we are interested in reprints of playbooks, not playtexts, and so consider F2 as a single book and a single reprint of F1”
“Applying our parameters to the periods analyzed by Blayney but extending our reprint window to twenty-five years to match his yields reprint rates of 42.7 percent (thirty-eight of eighty-nine) for 1583–1602, 43.1 percent (forty-seven of 109) for 1603–22, and 15.6 percent (twenty-one of 135) for 1623–42. Since Blayney’s figures turn out to be higher than ours, our argument about the popularity of playbooks remains unaffected.”

“Sermon Archive: Our sermon archive includes all known editions of sermons in English first printed from 1576 to 1640. We compiled this archive by searching in the STC and ESTC, and by consulting the following works”

In Bannet’s book the importance of the French Revolution itself is actually minimised, when compared, that is, with the behavioural and attitudinal changes slowly fomented by British women writers across the eighteenth century. But, Bannet argues, the British reactions to the French Revolution nevertheless remain crucial in shaping and re-shaping ideas of domesticity.

            <Title>long history of using songs to be popular</Title>
            <Text>I've been thinking a lot about songs. As far as I can tell, in the 1820s, poets have been boldly revitalizing poetry by publishing edited versions of popular songs for at least fifty years.

The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects. But, seeing Wordsworth and Coleridge as participants in a literary conversation also makes them more interesting again, so I can forgive them their propaganda and just focus on how interesting it is that Wordsworth's 1798 "The Thorn" has so much in common with Hannah More's 1796 "Ballad of Robert and Richard" (both of them are trying to 'elevate' ghost stories above vulgar superstition, for the improvement of their audiences, but with completely different ideas as to what that entails).

The second part of "thinking a lot about songs" involves a leap of several hundred years: Jo Walton is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning writer, and she says that "the single most quoted thing I have ever written" is... a limerick she posted in a usenet newsgroup in 1998, "The Lurkers Support Me In Email," to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean.” I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find that Hannah More has also written a morally-improving ballad to that tune (or, if she hasn't, it's only because the song is too associated with Jacobins), and certainly her other songs all mention specific tunes which she assumes I will already know.

So there's something interesting to me, here, about the idea of layering your words over top of pattern someone else already knows, as a way to get your version to stick more easily in people's heads. I don't think Jo Walton was intentionally trying to write something extremely memorable, but Hannah More certainly was.</Text>

            <Title>18thC feeling</Title>
            <Text>Reading Feeling
My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional response, is this a healthy form of exercise for its audience’s moral feeling, or a weakening distraction from real moral action? These questions, in translated form, continue to shape my own questions about literature as a field: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor the importance of feeling without being misled by emotional manipulation?
The “major” works across the period are characterized by sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. My interest in the gothic and the supernatural is thus subsumed within a larger conversation about the representation of feeling. As Clery, Miles, and Gamer have explored in different ways, gothic and supernatural stories encompass a subset of literary strategies to understand and use feeling, which exist in conversation and competition with other strategies. Each work must strike its own balance between exciting the feelings of its readers, and moderating them. The simplest narrative tracing this development begins with a naive emotional philosophy of benevolence in sentimental novels, which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature.</Text>

            <Text>Reforming Gothic readers: repurposing the supernatural in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads
Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]
Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)
My project filling the gap: Hannah More!
Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.
[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

            <Text>Review Reviewed Work(s): Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation by John Guillory Review by: Sharon O'Dair Source: South Atlantic Review, Vol. 59, No. 2 (May, 1994), pp. 130-132 Published by: South Atlantic Modern Language Association Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3200802 
p.130: The debate about the literary canon or the "crisis" in the humanities engages literary critics not only because its resolution may affect the ways we do our work but also because its dissemination attracts public attention in ways few of our debates ever do.
p.130: Without dissenting from the progressive social agenda of liberal pluralism, Guillory attacks both the theoretical assumptions underlying liberal pluralism and the specific approach to curricular reform it has engendered. The pluralist critique of the canon rests upon the notion of representation, with an emphasis on the social identity of the author, who stands for particular social groups and whose writing expresses theideology of that group. As a principle of selection, representation thus replaces aesthetic judgment, which the pluralist critique "is compelled to regard ... as merely fraudulent, as a screen for the covert affirmation of hegemonic values which can be shown to be the real qualification for canonicity in the first place" (270).
p.130: Guillory aims partly to rehabilitate the value of aesthetic judgment, and he dedicates Cultural Capital's concluding chapter to that task. This effort, which one assumes even cultural conservatives will applaud, is predicated, however, on a critique of the mediating function of the school system in the process of canonization and, of course, of judgment.
p.131: The university, especially the research university, is the preserve of an elite; and the function of the lower levels of the school system is to exclude the vast majority of all peoples from access to it, thereby enabling the reproduction of class structures.
p.131: Cultural Capital argues forcefully—and in my view convincingly—that the problem of literary canon formation is best understood not as a problem of biased judgment or as a lack of representation but as “a problem in the constitution and distribution of access to the means of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption” (ix).
p.131: Regardless of race or gender, that is,"[t]hose who have never been taught, or have been very inadequately taught, the practice of reading have little occasion to rejoice at being 'represented’ in the canon” (38)
P.132: More important, perhaps, it reveals the difficulty anyone faces who imagines the dismantling of a system in which he or she holds a position of privilege.</Text>

            <Text>Lahti, Leo, Niko Ilomäki, and Mikko Tolonen. “A Quantitative Study of History in the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), 1470-1800.” LIBER Quarterly 25.2 (2015): 87–31. Web.
This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expanding audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3 </Text>

            <Text>Queer readings of the literature of the 1790s — which is to say, of the Gothic (since queer theory is rarely applied to the other genres of the period) — provide an invigorating way to value some of the most vibrant writing of the decade precisely for the features which rendered it less than “respectable.” [A lot of really good Gothic work is connected thematically rather than strictly chronologically, examining the “transtemporal affinities and connections” (CITE) that Felski argues are often shut out by contemporary historicist critique. And indeed, historicist critique is causing this mode of study to fall out of favour regarding the Female Gothic. Nonetheless, there is a rich history of transtemporal work on the Female Gothic.

            <Title>ch 2 - corpora</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two begins by examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. I make the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begin the process of revealing and interrogating their structural assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of digital eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s). I begin by simply attempting to establish how many titles each database includes from each year, 1789-99. Answering this basic demographic question will also illustrate the nature of each resource’s data structures, and allow the first comparisons between them. I am particularly interested to see which resources have ‘spikes’ in 1790 and 1795, years which are often assigned to works of uncertain date. I will also check each database for my four key authors. For each author I compile, based largely on non-digital resources, a list of every edition of every work that they published during this decade. Manually comparing each digital resource against this comprehensive list allows me to spot-check the completeness and accuracy of the corpus. I am particularly interested to see which works by each author are most widely distributed, and how successfully each corpus handles ambiguities of authorship. As I compare corpora to each other, I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I research the history of how each corpus was formed. As part of this process, I also discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I discuss the nature of the works they do not contain.  The second chapter thus establishes the contents and limitations of the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.</Text>
            <Comments>For example, how many unsigned works, or works published under pseudonyms, are correctly attributed? Are there any mistakes made between Ann Radcliffe and Ann Ward Radcliffe? Do they unify Charlotte Smith and Charlotte Turner Smith? Exploring these questions through authors with whom I am deeply familiar can indicate the error rates of the corpus as a whole.</Comments>

            <Text>As with Robinson and Smith, More has presented scholars a challenge in the quantity and range of writing produced during her lifetime. “With a lifetime that spanned the Augustan age to the Victorian age, and a writing career nearly as long, Hannah More can be considered at once both the intellectual child of the Age of Johnson and, in spirit if not quite in chronology, the ‘first Victorian’.” (Prior) More’s “pre-Victorian” evangelical leanings, and especially the Cheap Repository Tracts, have typically attracted the most attention. The Cheap Repository Tracts are a bibliographic challenge: it can be difficult to confirm the author, publication date, or circulation of any given tract, and there are at least a hundred tracts. Additionally, since the twentieth century More has presented an additional challenge in her subject matter: as Scheuermann observes, “[t]he problem with More is that while she is a most interesting figure, her ideas are largely repugnant to modern sensibilities. Critics often deal with this inconvenience either by apologizing for their subject or by changing what she says so that she seems closer to us in spirit” (237).
More’s literary afterlife began the year after her death, in 1834, with William Roberts’ publication of a collection of her letters. Roberts’ editorial choices set the tone for More’s biographers by emphasizing her conservatism. His omissions may have improved More’s standing in the nineteenth century, but by 1952 historian M. G. Jones already acknowledges “the unsympathetic portrait of her which has been handed down to posterity” (Jones 152) due to her approach to social reform. “Unable to refute these charges, Jones can offer only the partial excuse that More’s attitudes were typical of her time” (Nardin 268). Unlike Smith and Robinson, More’s reputation did not necessarily improve when she came to the attention of feminist scholars in the 1980s and 1990s, though work on More did increase. When Pederson writes about More in 1986, the previous scholarship that she cites is all historical: More matters to historians of 1790s politics, and to historians of the evangelical movement (Pederson 85), but Pederson sees little precedent for her own discussion of More’s writing as having literary, rather than historical, importance. Pederson argues that “only by examining the Cheap Repository within the context of popular literature can we understand the tracts for what they were: a broad evangelical assault on late eighteenth-century popular culture” (88).
Pederson’s attention to More’s literary contexts is shared by other scholars of the 1980s, though only Mitzi Meyers, who in 1986 contextualizes More’s didacticism alongside children’s literature more generally, seems to form a positive opinion of More. “Mitzi Myers, delighted to have found a female eighteenth-century writer who was clearly successful, largely rewrites More so that her ‘didactic’ works ‘scarcely stand second to the canonical novel in interest and importance’ in terms of ‘what they reveal about women’” (Scheuermann 238). Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace’s 1991 monograph, Their Fathers' Daughters: Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, and Patriarchal Complicity, better sums up the consensus on More: complicit in patriarchy. Blanch’s assessment is that “[d]espite the contemporary criticism that More was usurping roles that had traditionally been reserved for men, feminist critics such as Kowaleski-Wallace, Ellen Jordan, Mona Scheurmann, and Eleanor Ty have maligned More as antithetical to the course of social reform and have dismissed her as a passive agent of the patriarchy” (Blanch 87). More’s next biographer, Patricia Demers, continues this assessment in her 1996 biography The World of Hannah More. “Patricia Demers argues in a recent study that More’s “belief in a natural hierarchical social order,” a belief which Demers finds “angering in its condescension and immobility,” prevented More from doing anything significant to improve conditions among the poor (Demers, 2)” (Nardin 268). The emphasis on More’s politics also begins to shift attention away from literary interpretation. “Writing for More is primarily a mode of instruction, whether in poetry, drama, essay, or tract, conveying either a female or a male voice of authority.” (Demers 109)
In the early 2000s, scholarship emerges that is more ready to find merit or sympathetic politics in More. Scheuermann describes this phenomenon as critics “changing what she says so that she seems closer to us in spirit” (237); Scheuermann herself presents More as reprehensible propagandist. But it is work like Jane Nardin’s — which argues that “although More was a less enthusiastic believer in the ‘hierarchical social order’ than most scholars have argued, the evasions and compromises she engaged in as a practical reformer helped to damage her reputation with posterity” (269) — which takes the more common stance. This is the More who can be inspiring in her importance and innovation, as suggested by titles like Kevin Gilmartin’s “Hannah More and the Invention of Conservative Culture in Britain” and Anne Stott’s Hannah More: The First Victorian, both published in 2003.
Throughout this history of struggling with More’s conservatism, More has been almost synonymous with the Cheap Repository Tracts. “At the time of the Repository’s conception in 1794, More’s public profile was that of a playwright and a controversial political commentator, yet, the annals of literary history emphasize her contributions as an educator and religious writer … Indeed, the ‘sublime and immortal’ Cheap Repository is the primary reason she is considered by some to have been the most prominent woman evangelical campaigner in England between 1780 and 1810” (Blanch 1). The history of these tracts begins with G.H. Spinney’s 1939 bibliography of extant Cheap Repository tracts held by the British Library. Spinney’s work filled an important need — “Scholarly recognition of the lack of clarity regarding the Cheap Repository bibliography, including authorship, dates back to Augustus De Morgan in 1864 (241-45)” (Blanch 11) — and has remained, eighty years after its publication, an invaluable source. It is perhaps only surpassed by Anna Maree Blanch’s 2009 thesis, A Reassessment of the Authorship of the Cheap Repository Tracts. Blanch makes the case that “[s]tatements describing Hannah More’s contributions have been repeated by generation after generation of scholars uncontested” (12), and describes with evident frustration several works which appear at first not to have based their claims on Spinney, but which, when traced, have their origin in the same single paragraph. Blanch herself has carried out new original research. Blanch identifies 127 tracts in the original run of the Cheap Repository Tracts, of which “58 tracts are either conclusively or tentatively attributed to More and 17 to others, while 52 tracts are described as being yet unattributable to any particular author” (Blanch 85).</Text>
            <Comments>“For example, Roberts removed criticism of the State and the Church arguably softening the ground for portrayals of More by feminist critics as complicit with the patriarchy” (Blanch 7)</Comments>

            <Text>“A novel, if at all useful, ought to be a representation of human life and manners, with a view to directing the conduct in the important duties of life, and to correct its follies. But what instruction is to be reaped from the distorted ideas of lunatics, I am at a loss to conceive . . . Are the duties of life so changed, that all the instruction necessary for a young person is to learn to walk at night upon the battlements of an old castle, to creep hands and feet along a narrow passage, and meet the devil at the end of it?” (footnote 23 in Gamer, qtd 55)

“Romances are a dangerous recreation. A few, no doubt, of the best may be friendly to good taste and good morals; but far the greater part are unskilfully written, and tend to corrupt the heart, and stimulate the passions. A habit of reading them breeds a dislike to history, and all the substantial parts of knowledge; withdraws the attention from nature, and truth; and fills the mind with extravagant thoughts, and too often with criminal propensities.” (James Beattie, Dissertations Moral and Critical, 574) (qtd in Gamer 56)

“History and fable have distinct merits, the one to inform us of past events, and the other to inforce wholesome principles by fictitious machinery, and to illustrate them: the latter is indeed often wantonly employed by men of strong imaginations, for no better purpose than to furnish amusement for the leisure of the indolent who read to fill up time. While these species of composition are kept distinct, they answer their respective purposes: but to blend them together, is to poison the sources of information to young readers; who, after feasting on history embellished with these meretricious ornaments, will not easily relish the dry details of truth: such writers, therefore, as they do not address themselves to mature understandings, are not to be considered as candidates for mature praise.” (qtd in Gamer 61)

“[T]he tale is indeed a tale of horror, yet the most painful impression which the work left on our minds was that of great acquirements and splendid genius employed to furnish a mormo for children, a poison for youth, and a provoca- tive for the debauchee. Tales of enchantments and witchcraft can never be useful: our author has contrived to make them pernicious, by blending, with an irreverent negligence, all that is most awfully true in religion with all that is most ridiculously absurd in superstition.94” (qtd Gamer 77)</Text>

            <Text>John Guillory contends that the “canon debate” taking place during his moment of writing in 1993 “signifies nothing less than a crisis in the form of cultural capital we call ‘literature’” \cite{Guillory:1993ve p.viii}; as both he and I argue, the roots of this crisis lie two hundred years earlier, in the eighteenth century formation of a vernacular (rather than classical) literary canon, and in the 1790s “first crisis” (\cite{Guillory:1993ve p.xi} of that canon. Guillory turns particularly to Wordsworth and Coleridge, and the strategies by which they confer a high status on their own work by undermining the cultural capital of other forms.


Guillory further argues that, although unequal access to “the means of literary production” (CITE) is intimately tied to class, the important barriers are not always purely financial. Rather, “the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered … a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself” (329). That is to say, because serious works “assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education" (330), those works [can maintain class hierarchies/barriers through OTHER MEANS.]</Text>

            <Text>All written by Mary Mark Ockerbloom

“Her later poetical works included a second volume of Poems (1794); a sonnet sequence, Sappho and Phaeon (1796); and finally Lyrical Tales (1800). Mary Robinson frequently contributed poetry to the Morning Post, and eventually edited their poetry page. This increased her contact with the other poets and their work.” (WWO)
“More lucrative than Mary Robinson's poetry, was her prose. The money helped to support herself, her mother and daughter, and often Banastre Tarleton. Novels such as Vancenza (1792), The Widow (1794), Angelina (1796), and Walsingham (1797) went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror, their views could be related to the experiences of their author.” (Mark Ockerbloom)
“In both The False Friend (1799) and The Natural Daughter (1799) she responded to the defection of Banastre Tarleton. The death of his mother in 1797 catalyzed him to end his 15-year relationship with Mary.” (Mark Ockerbloom)
“She expressed her disillusionment with marriage in a work of social criticism, entitled A Letter to the Women of England, on the Injustice of Mental Subordination (1799). First published under the name of Anne Frances Randall, it reflected the thinking of her friends Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin. Mary argued for the choice of a wife to leave her husband, as she had done years before.” (Mark Ockerbloom)
“Mary Robinson also began to write her autobiography. However, her health became increasingly poor, and she died on December 26, 1800, leaving it unfinished. Her daughter Maria Elizabeth edited and published her memoirs (Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself, With Some Posthumous Pieces, 1801) and a collected edition of her Poetical Works (1806).” (Mark Ockerbloom)


“Mary Robinson appeared in her most famous (and infamous) role at age 21, a four-year veteran of the stage. Her success as Perdita in A Winter's Tale led to a royal request for a command performance. On December 3, 1779, the 17-year-old Prince of Wales (later King George IV) determined to make her his mistress. … Although the affair lasted less than a year, 'the Perdita' was notorious from then on; her gowns, her carriages, and her alliances became a constant source of discussion and speculation in the newspapers.” (WWO)
“The Prince's defection left Mary Robinson in a difficult position. Both the Robinsons were living on borrowed money, deeply in debt. She had ruined her reputation and given up a promising career as an actress, and received only promises in return. The Prince might have been expected to make some provision for his ex-mistress, but he did not. Her reputation already destroyed, Mary Robinson seems to have cared little about causing further scandal. She demanded £25,000 for the return of the prince's letters. She apparently settled for £5,000, paid by George III "to get my son out of this shameful scrape." It was enough to stave off her creditors. In 1782, Mary obtained a further £500 annuity for herself, and a £200 annuity during the life of Maria Elizabeth, in return for the surrender of the Prince's bond.
Lord Malden, the Prince's original emissary, was now Mary's most frequent companion, and her lover. Rumour also associated her with Charles James Fox, who negotiated the annuity settlement for her. So long as the men she associated with were attractive and attentive, she seemed willing to befriend them. (Thomas Robinson, though still alive, was uninvolved in her later life.)” (WWO)
“One night Lord Malden, Mary's 'protector', bet 1000 guineas that Mary would be true to him if Banastre Tarleton tried to seduce her. Several weeks later, Tarleton won both Mary's affections and the bet. Mary, when she learned what they had done, was furious with both men. Lord Malden, feeling himself betrayed when he had believed in her, rejected her. Tarleton seemed to care little for what happened. But after an accident in her phaeton, it was Banastre Tarleton who hurried to Mary's side - and she forgave him. Their seemingly unlikely relationship was to continue for the next 15 years.” (WWO)
“Tarleton's family viewed both extensive gambling and the notorious Perdita as dangers attendant upon London society. They offered to pay Banastre's most pressing debts of honour (more than they could readily afford) on the condition that he leave for the Continent - alone. Faced with social ruin otherwise, Tarleton set out for France on July 24, 1783. Mary desperately borrowed money for his debts, in hopes that he would stay in England, and set out in a post-chaise for Dover to intercept him. She was pregnant, and the rough travel caused a miscarriage. Mary suffered further injuries as a result of the incompetence of the midwife who attended her. Her legs became partially paralyzed, and she was affected by increasing paralysis and acutely painful rheumatism for the rest of her life.”
“The possibility of an election in the spring of 1784, brought Tarleton back to England to campaign in Liverpool. He moved in with Mary Robinson, and they plunged into the excitement of the campaign. However, Tarleton was not elected, and did not receive an appointment from those who were elected to power. Creditors began to gather once again: Mary's possessions were seized and auctioned off. She saved only the diamond-studded portrait of the Prince of Wales. When the Duc de Lauzun offered his hospitality in the fall of 1784, Ban and Mary quietly left for France.” (WWO)
“Tarleton and Robinson spent the next few years living intermittently in France and in Germany. They worked together composing and revising Tarleton's History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 (1787). Mary verified and augmented Banastre's memories of the campaigns, using letters, dispatches, and newspaper accounts. In 1787, Tarleton returned to London for the book's publication. It gained him some prestige, but little income. Fortunes were changing hands in gambling hells, so he and a partner opened a faro-bank in hopes of making theirs. Mary continued to write poetry, and was reportedly working on an opera. By the fall of 1787, her health had improved enough that she considered returning to England. Ban Tarleton went to Aix-la-Chapelle to meet her, and in 1788, Mary Robinson returned to England, settling at 42 Clarges Street. Tarleton lived just down the street, at number 30.” (WWO)
Though they experienced several breakups and reconciliations, which prompted Mary Robinson to write poems such as "Lines to Him Who Will Understand Them.", and the sonnet sequence Sappho and Phaeon , Mary Robinson's relationship with Tarleton continued until 1798. During that time, Banastre Tarleton pursued his interests in politics. He became a member of Parliament, and was promoted to Colonel and later General. During the same time, Mary Robinson wrote prolifically. Her poetry and fiction achieved considerable acclaim. (Her attempts at writing for the theatre were less successful.)</Text>

            <Text>“Having begun as an actress, courtesan and fashion icon, she broke onto the late eighteenth-century literary scene first as that embodiment of sensibility, a Della Cruscan poet. Forging conversation through her writing, she proceeded to make herself a central literary figure of the 1790s, creating authorial identities inextricably linked with other Romantic writers. A prolific writer and increasingly radical thinker, she published in the last ten years of her life four verse collections, six individual long poems, a sonnet sequence, seven novels, two plays, a translation, three political essays, hundreds of poems for different / newspapers and a draft of her memoirs.” (Cross 1-2)

“Susan Luther, Stuart Curran, Judith Pascoe, Eleanor Ty and  Sharon  Setzer  in  the  mid-1990s  launched  an  intense  period  of  scholarly  work  on  Robinson.  Highlighting  Robinson’s  writing  “as  a  kind  of  cultural  barometer  of  aesthetic  changes  [that]  initiate[s]  or  engage[s]  in  her  society’s  every  literary  preoccupation”  (20),  Pascoe’s  groundbreaking  Romantic Theatricality  (1997),  in  particular,  situated  Robinson’s  pseudonymous  theatrical  writing  at  the  center  of  late  eighteenth-century  literary  culture.19 Since then, Robinson’s performativity has been the dominant lens through which her writing and her career have been interpreted. According to Pascoe, Robinson enacted in her writing an ever-shifting public identity, a “fluid theatricality” (9) that was both her trademark and an embodiment of “theatrical modes of representation” (7) that were constitutive of Romantic authorial identity. The theater provided the “central vehicle” for her multiple transformations beyond the stage, supplying “an identifiable collection of practices  at  once  portable  and  applicable  to  other  cultural  areas”  (Gamer  and T. Robinson 220). These other areas include her interaction with other Romantic poets, the other primary lens for interpreting Robinson’s writing, in particular her relations with Coleridge and the Della Cruscans, to a lesser extent Wordsworth and, more recently, Southey and Smith.” (Cross 6)
“I seek to combine these two approaches, taking a cue from Daniel Robinson’s The  Poetry  of  Mary  Robinson:  Form  and  Fame  (2011),  which  argues  for  Robinson’s obsession with “social interaction and literary intertextuality ... [as a means] to achieve professional legitimacy, recognition and fame” (8) as an author, and which minutely traces the web of networks that Robinson created  through  her  pseudonymous  poetics  and  her  formal  virtuosity.  Rather  than  focusing  on  Robinson’s  “avatars,”  this  book  foregrounds  her / professional and sympathetic engagements with specific writers; it is here, I contend, that she constructed her literary reputation. Self-inventive as they are, these exchanges remained singular and distinct from one another rather than constituting a network. They were addressed to particular individuals and were as much about intimacy and sympathetic exchange as they were about performativity. Indeed, it is the combination of these properties in her allusive exchanges—seemingly private yet meant to be public (rather than the private made public)—that distinguishes her dialogues. By interanimat-ing  subject  and  object,  speaker  and  interlocutor,  these  dialogues  produce  mutual obligations that simultaneously authorize self and other. In the pro-cess, they reveal a writer who could only, paradoxically, achieve an authorial identity through conversation with others.” (6-7)

Dialogue  is,  of  course,  performative,  and  Robinson’s  exchanges  are  especially  so.  As  Michael  Gamer  and  Terry  Robinson  have  argued,  Mary  Robinson  exploited  the  parallels  between  dramatic  and  textual  spaces  by  transporting theatre’s “mode of allusive practice” from the theatre into the many  other  public  arenas  in  which  she  participated  (254).  But  dialogue,  especially written dialogue, is also a different kind of performance from the theater  because  of  the  intertextuality  of  the  exchange.  It  shifts  the  visual,  public  dynamic  of  the  theater  to  the  more  private  realm  of  textuality  in  which surface and depth, self and other become blurred.  (Cross 7)

Most commentators on Robinson’s literary production have focused on individual texts—either her poetry or fiction, not both—and followed the responses of her reviewers, reading the poetry as better crafted, a serious bid for literary reputation in a masculine tradition, and the novels as hastily produced, a matter of economic exigency and part of women’s feminizing dominance of the fiction market. See, for example, the reviews of Walsingham and D. Robinson, Poetry (11–12). (Cross 12)

The  publication  of  the  eight-volume  complete  Works  by  Mary  Robinson  by  Pickering  and  Chatto  (2009–2010),  under  the  direction  of  William  Brewer,  marked  Robinson’s  official  reentrance  into  the  literary  canon.  All  citations  of  Robinson’s work will be from this edition unless indicated otherwise and will be cited as M RW by volume and page. Robinson’s writing is also available in individual editions by Broadview and Oxford, as well as others, and online at Romantic Circles. There are three recent biographies Byrne (2004), Davenport (2006) and Gristwood (2005). See also Bass, The Green Dragoon. (Cross 12)

While  Robinson’s  biography  has  produced  interpretations  of  her  as  celebrity  or  fallen  woman,  audacious  or  meretricious,  her  authorship  has  led  to  inter-pretations  that  portray  her  as  a  Sapphic  poet  of  sensibility  (McGann,  Poetics of Sensibility [ch.10]), a revolutionary novelist (Garnai, Revolutionary), and a radical polemicist, fighting for the rights of man and woman (Hodson). These representations  have  also  been  qualified  by  attention  to  her  disdain  for  other  women writers and her sympathy for the Prince of Wales (D. Robinson). (Cross 13)

“Scholarship  on  Robinson  has  proliferated  since  Pascoe’s  study  and  has  been  wide-ranging  in  scope,  including  further  studies  analyzing  her  performative  subjectivity and her chameleonic self-fashioning; her position as a woman writer within  late  eighteenth-century  culture;  her  urban  focus;  her  adaptations  of different genres, including the sonnet, ode, lyric, romance and the gothic novel; her relationships with specific writers, primarily poets, especially Coleridge; and her radical politics, as well as essays offering pedagogical strategies and tracing publication  history.  On  her  performative  subjectivity  and  her  chameleonic  self-fashioning  more  generally,  see  Gamer  and  T.  Robinson;  Mellor,  “Making  an  Exhibition”;  Pascoe,  Romantic Theatricality. Specific  angles  on  this  theme  include  attention  to  Robinson’s  celebrity  status  (Brock,  Mole);  masquerade  (Cullen, Sigler); fashion (Fay); her portraits (Anca, Munteanu); her use of pseudonyms (Pascoe, Wilson); cross-dressing (Binhammer, “Female Homosociality”; Shaffer,  “Gender,  Pain”  and  “Cross-Dressing”;  Setzer,  “The  Dying  Game”);  her  acting  career  (Barbour,  “Garrick’s  Version”;  Eger);  sylphs  (Labbe,  “Mary  Robinson’s Sylphid Self”); and polygraphs (Brewer, “Subverting Individuality”). On her position as a woman writer within late-eighteenth-century culture, see especially Labbe, “Selling One’s Sorrows”; Mellor; Miskolcze; Peterson; Ty. On her  adaptations  of  different  genres,  see,  for  example,  Barfoot,  D. Robinson, Poetry, and  Golding  (the  sonnet);  D.  Robinson  and  Pascoe,  Introduction  to  MRSP (ode); Curran, “Romantic Poetry: The “I” Altered” and “Mary Robinson and  the  New  Lyric”  (lyric);  Labbe,  Romantic  Paradox,  (romance);  Brewer,  “Mary Robinson as a Dramatist” (drama); Ford, Setzer, Ty (the novel); Peterson, Runge  and  Setzer,  “Gothic  Structure”  (memoirs);  political  tract  (Hodson);Vargo, “Tabitha Bramble” (lyrical tale); Close and Labbe, “Romance and Vio-lence” (gothic); Craciun, “Mary Robinson and the Monthly Magazine,” Hessel and  Pascoe,  Romantic  Theatricality  (newspaper  publication).  On  Robinson’s  politics,  see  Brewer,  “Egalitarianism”;  Craciun,  “Violence  against  Difference”;  Garnai;  Guest;  Markley;  Russo.  See  Wilson  and  Vernooy-Eep  for  pedagogical  strategies and Hawley; Fergus and Thaddeus; Hoagwood and Ledbetter; Kurtz and Womer for book history. On Robinson and Marie Antoinette, see Craciun  / and Garnai. On Robinson and race, see Garcia and Shelley Jones. Robinson’s texts  have  also  been  productively  approached  through  distinctive  thematics  such as dreams (D. Robinson, “Coleridge, Mary Robinson and the Prosody of Dreams”), luxury (Saglia, “Commerce, Luxury”), flies (Cross “To “buzz lament-ing  doings  in  the  air’”),  vacancy  (Singer),  and  most  recently,  “feral  openness”  (Milne).” (Cross 13-14)</Text>

            <Title>what to teach: convo with Jack copy</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

Timeliness and feeling, as investigated through bibliographical research and reparative reading, thus chart a tangled network of interrelated concepts. Reparative reading requires an openess to the multiplicity of meaning which works may accrue as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and adapated in response to the pressures of timeliness. Precise bibliographical research can recapture and contextualize the complex and variable strategies of feeling that competed throughout the period. Not yet integrated into this set of priorities and methodological frameworks is the element of my project which often requires the most justification: my use of quantitative and computational methodologies.</Text>

            <Title>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study</Title>
            <Text>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history":
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."
It requires research and study, in order to identify and disentangle the many projects and effects within a work; we must know which parts to discard and which to nurture, to render something useful to ourselves, and we must know what exists for us to repurpose: this is why I study literature. And it requires instruction in order to allow students to get past, e.g., "I thought I was supposed to respect Mrs Bennet" to the literary riches within: this is why I teach literature.
(Literature, unlike history, is permitted artistic license.)
This constant re-translation allows us to continue conferring and experiencing value to the work of previous generations. I don't value the past or tradition simplistically, or for the virtue of merely being older; but we do not always have to reinvent the wheel, and seeing that things were different in the past can allow us to remember that they will be different in the future.
(Though I suppose, since I proceed on the assumption that it is not possible to perceive or understand the "now," I do often dismiss the contemporary as insufficiently informative to be getting on with.)</Text>

            <Text>The first three databases I examine will be no surprise to eighteenth century scholars: ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP. Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), contains over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which 51,965 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 titles in the decade appear in the ESTC but not ECCO). The ESTC does not provide access to texts themselves: instead, it is an authoritative bibliographic catalogue, available as a searchable database. It is ECCO which provides texts: ECCO’s 180,000 titles works are available as photographed facsimiles of the full text of each title. The facsimiles can be searched within ECCO’s online interface; these searches examine a plaintext version of the facsimile pages that was generated by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but this OCR text is not made directly available. As a result, the facsimiles may be read individually by scholars, but cannot form the basis for computational corpus analysis. A subset of ECCO’s texts have been hand-prepared, as part of the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), to be easier to use in computational research. The resulting corpus of ECCO-TCP texts contains 2,231 titles, of which 466 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. These titles are available as carefully-edited texts encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard, which not only provides an accurate version of the text’s words, but encodes substantial details regarding its context on the page. Most large-scale distant reading of eighteenth century literature relies on the ECCO-TCP corpus as its ‘model’ or ‘sample’ to represent the period. Accordingly, one of the tasks of this dissertation is to examine the makeup of this corpus, and how it differs both from other corpora and from print culture in the period itself. These three digital collections — ECCO, ESTC, and ECCO-TCP — are the primary digital resources for the period, which form the basis of most digital research. However, they represent only one approach toward the collection and presentation of digital texts, to which there are two broad kinds of alternatives. These large but meticulous collections occupy a middle space between, on the one hand, highly selective thematic collections, such as The Shelley-Godwin Archive, of which there are many, and the giants of indiscriminate textual accumulation, such as Google Books, of which there are few.</Text>

            <Text>In contrast to the brevity of Radcliffe’s bibliography and biography stands the mountain of secondary writing on her works. [NOTE: This section remains incomplete, with only a rough sketch of the literature review in place.] During her lifetime, Radcliffe was widely reviewed and discussed. Scholars have often examined Radcliffe’s responsiveness to reviews of her works, with each new novel changing the aspects which was critiqued most strongly in the previous.  [So she ultimately produces Gothics that reviewers are willing to accept on their own moral terms — and therefore Gothics which subsequent generation are willing to accept/praise?]
At her death in 1823, despite the twenty-six years since her last publication, an outpouring of obituaries marked her as an esteemed literary genius. Much of this praise followed the template so famously set out in Walter Scott’s ‘Prefatory Memoir to Mrs Ann Radcliffe’ in the tenth volume of James Ballantyne’s Novelist’s Library series. Despite Scott’s dismissive attitude toward the other romances that beguiled his youth, “he nonetheless takes care to defend the unquestionable genius of Ann Radcliffe on at least three accounts: her presiding over ‘a separate and distinct species of writing’ (Scott 1824: xx); her ability to sustain her readers’ interest and attention across three major novels … and her exploration of extreme human passions in appropriately southern European settings” (Townshend and Wright 5-6).
Since Scott, Radcliffe has continued to be consistently praised and studied, often in ways that establish the worthlessness of works similar to her; a ‘token’ who justifies the exclusion of women or feminine writing. In 2014, the volume Ann Radcliffe, Romanticism and the Gothic, edited by Dale Townshend and Angela Wright, commemorated 250 years since Radcliffe’s birth. In this volume, Radcliffe has weathered multiple changes in the critical landscape” “Once-dominant psychoanalytic and feminist interpretations have given way to critical work drawing on political and religious history, print culture studies, theories of media and remediation, and new formalism” (Carson 127).</Text>

            <Title>Prior, Hannah More</Title>
            <Text>“Not surprisingly then, judgments of More’s work cover an equally broad span of critical interpretation. Received with near-universal praise and adulation during her lifetime and immediately following, More quickly became, like many elements of the eighteenth century, outdated by the revolutionized England of the nineteenth century. Eventually, More slipped into obscurity, where she remained for much of the twentieth century. However, with the latter part of that century’s proliferation of new modes of interpretation and with it the re-discovery of lesser-known, under-appreciated authors and works, renewed attention has been given to More, repeating in simultaneous fashion the varied views that occurred over the course of the previous two centuries.” (Prior)

“To some recent critics, More is a reactionary, patriarchal foil to her radical feminist counterpart, Mary Wollstonecraft, an advocate for a conservative, counter-revolutionary sort of progress for women. Other critics, in recognition of her call for reform across all social strata, place More somewhere in between these extreme views. This variety of critical views points to the complexity of both More and the age of paradigmatic change in which More occupied an unusual position: born in the middle-class, she was embraced by the London elite and ministered to the poor; a devout Anglican she offered shelter to French Catholic priests exiled during the French Revolution; an educated and literary woman in a highly-gendered society, she overcame traditional gender boundaries while rejecting the revolutionary call for the rights of women; she shared, nevertheless, with Wollstonecraft the freelover a call to the reformation of women’s education along with the reformation of the manners and morality; a product of the Age of Reason, she appealed to sensibility in her attempts to address slavery, poverty, and irreligion.” (Prior)

“More’s writing now aimed more directly at a conservative agenda of reform that excluded no social class. While all of these works are conservative in assuming the preservation of class boundaries, they are progressive in their belief that individual reform is possible within one’s class, whether high, middle, or low. Such a position is now variously interpreted along a spectrum of critical views. Some critics accuse More’s efforts of serving merely to reinforce class boundaries by alleviating the worst distresses of poverty without eradicating it; others see her attempts as ultimately more effective because modest reform rather than radical revolution was more widely acceptable and achievable.” (Prior)

“The success of the Cheap Repository Tracts led More to expand these didactic short sketches and tales into a full-length novel. This was a rather bold undertaking since novels at this time were still viewed, particularly among conservatives like More, as a tawdry form of entertainment with base appeal. More had even offered her own disdain for novel-writers in her Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education. Nevertheless, encouraged by her fellow Claphamites, she published in late 1808 what would be her only novel, Cœlebs in Search of a Wife: Comprehending Observations on Domestic Habits and Manners, Religion and Morals. Part essay, part conduct book, and part novel, the book tells a fairly straightforward if longwinded account of – as the title makes clear – a young bachelor’s search for a wife. Interspersed among the various characters and incidents are observations and lessons on a range of topics such as education, child rearing, religion, and charity. By numerous accounts, the novel was one of the most widely-read and bestselling books of its kind. Indeed, it can be argued that More’s single attempt at novel-writing played a key role in helping the novel form to achieve the respectable status necessary for it to reach the artistic and literary height of the Victorian age. The fact that its unabashed didacticism renders it nearly unreadable today offers great insight into the vast literary and cultural changes that have taken place between More’s day and our own.” (Prior)

“With a lifetime that spanned the Augustan age to the Victorian age, and a writing career nearly as long, Hannah More can be considered at once both the intellectual child of the Age of Johnson and, in spirit if not quite in chronology, the ‘first Victorian’.” (Prior)

“To some recent critics, More is a reactionary, patriarchal foil to her radical feminist counterpart, Mary Wollstonecraft, an advocate for a conservative, counter-revolutionary sort of progress for women. Other critics, in recognition of her call for reform across all social strata, place More somewhere in between these extreme views. This variety of critical views points to the complexity of both More and the age of paradigmatic change in which More occupied an unusual position” (Prior)

“More’s writing now [i.e., in the 1790s] aimed more directly at a conservative agenda of reform that excluded no social class. While all of these works are conservative in assuming the preservation of class boundaries, they are progressive in their belief that individual reform is possible within one’s class, whether high, middle, or low. Such a position is now variously interpreted along a spectrum of critical views. Some critics accuse More’s efforts of serving merely to reinforce class boundaries by alleviating the worst distresses of poverty without eradicating it; others see her attempts as ultimately more effective because modest reform rather than radical revolution was more widely acceptable and achievable.” (Prior)</Text>

            <Title>McLaverty - Poems in print</Title>
            <Text>Abstract and Keywords
This chapter argues that relations between poetry and print in this period were uneasy. Poetry looked for freedom and expressivity; the book trade looked for a profit. But the consequence was a wonderfully varied output. Typography could be elaborate or chaste; format varied between the poles of dignity (the illustrated folio) and humility (the freely given-away slip); “topping” booksellers developed alongside the Grub Street trade and provincial rivals or collaborators. It was the period in which English poetry achieved classic status, with a consequent stability and longevity but also with an impetus toward authorial revision.
Keywords: poetry, print culture, typography, format, book trade, canon
The relationship between print and poetry in the period from Paradise Lost to Lyrical Ballads was an uneasy one. On poetry’s side, the link with a vocal performance and with the freedom and expressivity of manuscript circulation was still strong, and it was accompanied by a deep mistrust of compromise with the commercial demands of print.1 On print’s side, poetry was always going to be troublesome, because its frequent brevity and persistent demands on paper created difficulties in shaping it into something saleable. Prestige attached itself to the publication of great poems, but reference books, religious and political controversy, plays, and, late in the period, novels were a better financial bet. The sheer awkwardness of this relationship, however, generated a period of diversity and experiment.
What could be done to represent the human voice through the resources of the compositor’s case was tried, though it risked charges of diseconomy and inelegance. The beauties of manuscript publication were mimicked in large illustrated and ornamented quartos and folios, while some of its casualness was echoed in slips and half-sheets. In a counter move, poems played with the bookishness of their embodiment, toying with the dignity of the Bible or the classical variorum, or with the antique in the form of prophecy or medieval lyrics. The book trade’s most significant innovation, alongside the magazine and the miscellany, was to make the poetry book a luxury item, paying its way by using up more and better paper than it strictly needed in order to command a higher price. Although this practice moderated in the course of the century, it remained an influence in poetry publication, as it does today. As Roger Lonsdale notes in his pioneering New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse, late in the century booksellers turned poems themselves into vast reference collections, anthologizing the age’s verse and deciding which authors merited reprinting.2 My account will follow the eighteenth-century editors’ lead and, with some exceptions, focus on the poetry that they were already making canonical.3 (40)

Format
A striking aspect of poems in print in this period is that they appeared in so many different shapes and sizes. The question of suitable format for poems was unsettled. In a period when histories were published in quarto or folio, it is no surprise that collections of verse should appear in large formats, but that a large number of individual poems should be published in folio is surprising to the modern reader, as is the balancing publication of occasional and polemical poems in slips and half-sheets. Searching the ESTC provides a general picture for the eighteenth century.13 The smallest size used regularly was an eighth of a sheet, or the equivalent of one leaf of an octavo. There are few of these, and I suspect they were often given away—for example, a song from the theater where Henry Carey’s Honest Yorkshire Man (p. 45) was being performed—but there are more ¼os, where Foxon distinguishes between regular quarter-sheets and slips, which were printed in four columns parallel with the short side of the sheet and commonly used for songs. These constitute around 2.5 percent of the total. The really popular format for short pieces, generally occasional, was the half-sheet, the equivalent of a folio leaf but issued on its own, unfolded. In the early decades of the century this format rivaled the folio and quarto for popularity at 13–15 percent of the total, but it dropped off later; the figure for the century is around 7.5 percent. Folios were high in importance in the early decades of the century, rising to 30 percent of the total in the 1730s, but they too fell away very rapidly after 1750 and for the final three decades barely amount to 2 percent. Quartos performed much more steadily, constituting 33 percent of the output overall and rising to more than 50 percent in the 1760s and 1770s, when they started to dominate the luxury book market. Octavos too were popular throughout the century, making up around 45 percent in total. They far outstripped duodecimos, which were very unpopular for poems in the early period, when they struggled to make 5 percent (44-45)

Sales
The popularity of large formats in the early eighteenth century doubtless reflects a desire for dignity, but another important reason for their prevalence was commercial. As David Foxon says of Pope’s folio Windsor-Forest and Ode for Musick, they were printed in “a format which would justify a price sufficient to make a profit—one shilling for Windsor Forest in five sheets, 6d. for the Ode in three.”15 The basic problem was that demand for poetry was relatively low. Even poems that enjoyed critical esteem did not have big sales. The first edition of a poem by Pope could be expected to sell 2,000 copies, and those not necessarily all at once. Woodfall’s ledgers show him printing 2,000 copies of the First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace (1737), with 150 fine-paper copies in addition, while Bowyer printed only 2,000 copies of the New Dunciad (1742), which might have been expected to be a bestseller.16 And I don’t think Pope sold badly. Bowyer printed 2,000 copies of Gray’s Trivia, with 250 fine, in January 1716 and needed to print only 1,000 of the second edition in June. William Somervile’s The Chace was a popular success, running to eight editions between 1735 and 1749, but the first edition, printed by Bowyer, was a quarto of only 750 copies, with an additional 500 on royal paper, while the second edition dropped to octavo and was of 1,000 copies; only the third, again octavo, at 1,500 suggests marked success. The fourth authorized edition was not needed until 1743, and consisted of only 500 copies.17 It is worth (p. 47) noting that the sale of 6,000 copies of the octavo Rape of the Lock in six weeks was regarded as a phenomenal success. (46-47)
The Luxury Poetry Book
The credit for moving poetry to the luxury end of the book market, if it is credit, must go to Jacob Tonson, Sr. He saw that the bookseller’s financial problems could be solved not by printing as cheaply as possible, but by printing elegantly and charging a higher price.
Tonson’s influence on the poetry book can be seen by comparing the first edition of Paradise Lost of 1667 with his edition of 1688. The first edition is printed without fuss, as though the poem is a slightly extravagant form of prose. The format is quarto, with the type set solid. Rules are used to surround the text tightly, with boxes to the upper and outer margins. The impression is of a religious text; the presentation, though without black letter and double columns, is not unlike that of the King James Bible.19 Tonson’s 1688 edition, undertaken jointly with Richard Bentley, is altogether more spacious, with Milton beginning to (p. 48) be treated as a classic. The edition was marketed by subscription, a fusion of patronage and publication; in buying the book in advance you supported it with cash and with your name. The 1688 Paradise Lost is a folio in fours, much more spacious than the quarto first edition, and it is illustrated. (47-48)
Conclusion
The most remarkable aspect of poems in print in this period is their sheer variety, and it is worth noting in conclusion how much poems differed in themselves. Print might be expected to have the effect of stabilizing poetic texts, but it has its own inbuilt tendency toward variation.30 Even if stop-press correction, prevalent in the early period, is put aside, there are opportunities for change through later editions, the correction and expansion of existing works, and the addition of introductory and explanatory apparatus. The initiative for such changes may often come from the author, but the book trade clearly has an interest in generating new copy and new sales. (53)

            <Text>Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices. Its extended discussion (and, at points, critique) of the practice of critique highlights similarities between conversations about reading in the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries. For example, when Felski hyperbolically lists the “unserious” reading practices which are presumed to be the only alternative to critique, “naive reading, sentimental effusion, impressionistic judgment, fuzzy-headed amateurism, and mere ‘chatter about Shelley’,” sentimentality is explicitly named alongside forms of ‘sloppy’ thinking that are presumed to be incompatible with rationality. The need to maintain rationality in the face of emotion takes on moral implications in Felski’s hyperbole as well: without critique, the question goes, “what will save us from perdition, what will keep us from committing all those sins we’ve been warned against,” what will keep us from being dangerously bad readers? Of course, part of Felski’s conclusion is that these forms of “bad reading” are not, despite their emotional contamination, morally wrong or intellectual vacuous — but like Sedgwick, she sketches her alternative lightly.</Text>

            <Title>Chi squared test</Title>
            <Text>OKAY, so, this is way less ~science~ than it probably appears, but: the rule of thumb for chi squared tests is to only do them when the expected value (if the null hypothesis is true) in any given cell is 5 or greater. In this case, we would have 4 cells (has tag/male, has tag/female, does not have tag/male, does not have tag/female), and the null hypothesis would be that the tags are just as likely to be in mens’ work as in womens’ work
(It could also probably work as a 2 cell test, and the nuances of which it should be are slightly above my read-about-this-for-10-minutes pay grade, but it doesn’t matter because you aren’t actually doing the test)
So the expected value in each cell would have to be 5 or above, which means that you would need at least 10 total works with the tag

Alyssa Fowers:
	this is less science-y than it appears because there are other statistical tests that you could do with smaller sample sizes, hOWEVER
	it’s something to go off of!
Lawrence Evalyn:
	thank you so much!!!!
Alyssa Fowers:
	and the chi-squared test is definitely the basic test you’d be most likely to use in this case


Alyssa Fowers:
	Actually, crud, what is the general % of mens/womens/unknown works in this set?
Lawrence Evalyn:
	uh, more women than men, lemme see
	His corpus is 43% female, 31% male, 26% unknown.
Alyssa Fowers:
	Ohhh okay, hm
Lawrence Evalyn:
	215 f, 156 m -- 58% female
Alyssa Fowers:
	So you’d want at least 5 in each group you’re looking at *if* it matched the distribution of the sample, I think
Lawrence Evalyn:
	(if we ignore the unsigned works)
Alyssa Fowers:
	you wouldn’t expect 50% men/50% women in a tag from this corpus--that would indicate an unusual number of men wrote about the thing. Let me math real quick
Lawrence Evalyn:
	so I guess my null hypothesis is, if there are 10 books, there should be 6 by women and 4 by men
Alyssa Fowers:
	(if we ignore unsigned works)
	Yeah

Alyssa Fowers:
	So you’d want 13 total works
	not including unsigned ones
Lawrence Evalyn:
	ok!
Alyssa Fowers:
	so that you could have at least 5 men
Lawrence Evalyn:
	because that would be 5 men and 8 women
Alyssa Fowers:
	Yeha
	I’m rounding up slightly because I don’t think you could have 12.5 women</Text>

            <Title>intro - archive formation</Title>
            <Text>My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade.
My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, I will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty.
My subject matter situates me in a densely-discussed intersection of scholarly fields.

The years 1789-99 make an eleven-year “decade” delimited by the major events of the French Revolution, but also home to a crucial literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form. 
18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernacular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. 
The introduction will also address who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.
(How do I define my geographical area? England, or “Britain”? I could just focus on London; even if I try not to, I suspect actually nearly everything will end up being from London.) </Text>

            <Title>Tabor, Stephen. ESTC</Title>
            <Text>The British Library’s opening of the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC) to free public access on the Web in the autumn of 2006 drew a grateful and eager response from the worldwide community of scholars and their universities. Similar sentiments echoed from a lower-profile network of antiquarian booksellers, who, mostly lacking institutional support, had to weigh the potential value of every search in the file against a unit charge (in the United States) of $2.28 plus a connection fee of $4.05 per hour. Whoever footed the bill, the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing. The freeing of ESTC, which combines those two components with a continuation up to and including 1800, now places in one location, for the consultation of anyone with internet access, the fullest and most up-to-date bibliographical account of ‘English’ printing (in the broadest sense) for its first 328 years. Within its scope it has no rival. At the same time it cannot be called ‘definitive’ in the same way that one might have been in the habit of considering STC and Wing. This is because of its peculiar evolution over thirty years as an online database — always under construction, always exposed to damage from careless or ill-informed alterations, but always capable of improvement. Now that the British Library has made ESTC widely available, the time seems appropriate to explore some aspects of the relationship between this fluidity of content and the file’s status as an authoritative resource. (367)

An increasingly common trend, I am sorry to report, is that more and more people do not want ESTC at all — they want ECCO or EEBO. The younger generation of scholars in particular, lured by full-text images and ransacking the Web for illustrations for their books and articles, are using these utilities as de facto bibliographic databases. They find that the stripped-down records and simplified indexes are good enough for their purposes. To a minority of them, the fact that other works, editions, and copies exist outside the Web is irrelevant, and perhaps even irritating. To use a metaphor, some people prefer to explore the world through books of photo- graphs with occasional schematic maps. ESTC, on the other hand, provides the equivalent of a detailed topographic map, but no pictures. Such technical tools have limited appeal, even to some specialists; but if you want to thoroughly learn the lie of the land, you will need one, and the more complete and accurate the better. My comments below about how ESTC is used and perceived should be taken partly in the context of the differences and competition between these two markets — the world of pictures and the world of descriptions. It may be that, in time, a détente will be struck that will allow the unification in one database of the visual aspects of EEBO and ECCO with the full, constantly updated terrain-mapping power of ESTC — and make it all free.6 As things stand, the opening of ESTC is not only a widely hailed boon to scholarship; it was a prerequisite for its survival on the internet-based playing field. (368)

My discussion, therefore, concerns the needs of the specialist audience that has formed ESTC’s main constituency in the past and may reasonably be expected to continue as such: the explorers in the field who need detailed maps. In my task of mediating between the file and its users, I find that these people approach early books with questions regarding one or both of two broad topics: intellectual content and physical characteristics, the latter including the location of copies. For every question I get of the first type, I probably get five that deal with the physicality of books. (369)

Because ESTC is a bibliographical database rather than a catalogue, strictly speaking, its records describe groups of copies rather than specific copies. In the great majority of cases each record describes a single edition. This rule is bent when certain separately planned marketing units can be identified within the edition, such as reissues,7 imprint variants,8 and large versus regular-paper copies.9 For the later eighteenth century, when reprints from standing type became more common, ESTC cataloguers have occasion- ally granularized down to the level of individual impressions.10 This is a pragmatic and reasonable response to more complex bibliographical situa- tions, and the theory need not concern us here. For the purpose of this discussion it is sufficient to refer to all of these categories as ‘editions’.
ESTC’s most basic bibliographical function is to provide, for each edition, a description of the ideal copy, meaning the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it. (369)

To each of these ideal descriptions are attached records of physical copies that match that description. As additional reports of copies arrive, it may be that the ideal description must change in response. For instance, the existence of a half-title may only emerge on the evidence of the seventh copy reported. A half-title would then be added to the description of the ideal copy, and the six previously matched physical copies will receive notes recording that they are imperfect in this respect. When everything is working right, as it does in ESTC more often than not, the bibliographical description is completely accurate as far as it attempts to go, and variations in the matched copies can be reliably determined by the presence or absence of copy-specific notes. If anything happens to disturb the links between the description and its attached holdings, including errors committed in the course of creating the description, the record gets broken and starts telling lies about physical copies or, worse, about the ideal copy. Broken records waste people’s time by sending them off after new editions that turn out to be old ones, and after complete copies that prove defective or even non- existent. They force users to rewrite parts of the records for their own use, but these corrections rarely get reported back to ESTC. If enough records get broken, the file containing them starts to devolve to the state of some- thing like OCLC’s WorldCat — which is to say, a grab-bag mixing precision and approximation with little editorial oversight.
In ESTC the matching process hinges on five points of identity: the title, as far as it is given by ESTC; the edition statement; the imprint, again as far as it is given by ESTC; the pagination; and the format. (370)

“Complete title transcriptions allow each piece to describe itself more fully” (370) … “However, fuller transcriptions can also serve to undermine the reliability of the database.” (371). It is also difficult for a cataloguer to transcribe a long, pre-1701 title without committing a single typo. Using EEBO and ECCO before the eighteenth-century records were expanded, I checked the transcriptions in a random sample of 150 ESTC records, fifty each for the STC, Wing, and eighteenth-century periods.12 For imprint dates 1473–1640, 52 per cent of the records contained discrepancies that should preclude matching; for the 1641–1700 period, 28 per cent were unmatchable; while for the eighteenth century, only 10 per cent had errors.13” (371) “In my original sample of fifty eighteenth-century records with a 10 per cent error rate, thirty-eight have subsequently received expanded transcriptions, and the error rate among those is now 29 per cent — comparable to the Wing sample.” (372)
“This survey shows that the policy of giving complete titles, despite its numerous benefits, can actually have an adverse impact on the overall reliability of the file. On the purely mechanical level of reproducing title-page information, ESTC has adopted standards of description that tend to overshoot the ability of its cataloguers to meet them. Sometimes it is necessary to balance a zeal for exhaustiveness against the burden it imposes on human frailty, and the original planners of ESTC recognized this.”

“This trend is somewhat exaggerated in my survey: because of patterns of production and survival, a random selection from a given period will tend to be chronologically weighted towards its later end.” (371)

“The same human qualities that give rise to transcription errors by cataloguers allow their persistence through numerous proofreadings by matchers.” (372)

“Some records carry notes pointing out known problems with the tran- scriptions. Record S112807, created in December 1991, transcribes the word ‘plants’ in the title. In 2002 a grant-funded team, which worked at the Folger Shakespeare Library between 1996 and 2003, inserted a note in the record reading ‘DFONOTE” (372)
“‘DFo’ is the Library of Congress-assigned siglum for the Folger; ‘jre’ is the matcher’s initials. Once again, this record may be corrected shortly after the appearance of this article, and at the time of writing it was not possible to search for other examples by means of the public interface. The DFONOTEs appear in the ‘Uncontrolled note’ field, which is currently not searchable. ” (372)
“this is another example where a bibliographical record has accumulated a convincing weight of testimony supporting an erroneous description.” (373)

“The STAR file, maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. It also serves as a gateway for authorized libraries to make direct online matches of their holdings to ESTC. In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC’s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.” (373) 

“One useful innovation in STAR is an extension of the old verified/unverified/primary match types. These can be viewed in the public file, though only in the forbidding-looking ‘MARC tags’ display option. Contributor matches in STAR — those made outside the ESTC offices — are tagged as ‘web matches’, indicating that they were not vetted by ESTC staff. Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the ‘verified’ and ‘unverified’ levels.17 Matches derived from automated uploads from various outside databases are rather confusingly designated ‘catalogue matches’, and have a comparatively low level of reliability. These two new categories can be identified in the ‘MARC tags’ display, in field 852, subfield x, as letter codes W and C (supplementing the original V, U, and P tags).”
“The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to ‘verified’. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt.” (374) 

“Outside matchers using STAR who suspect a problem in a record are asked to attach a ‘cataloguer’s note’ or ‘annotation’ that becomes part of the STAR record. … Like the DFONOTEs, the STAR annotation immediately ruptures the bond between the bibliographical record and its attached holdings. Contributor notes in STAR are invisible in the public display, so regular ESTC users will be unaware of this reported preliminary leaf; but if they could read the note, there are few who would bet money on which of the matched copies have the order-to-print leaf and which do not. The situation will get more tangled as more matches arrive.” (374) “There are now more than 9,100 of these new ‘annotations’ in STAR, affecting records from 1483 up to and including 1800.” (374)
“These open construction sites are part of a trade-off for ESTC’s being able to claim virtual completeness within its declared scope, and there is no doubt that this completeness gives it a competitive boost vis-à-vis ECCO and EEBO, at least for some audiences.” (374)
“When the ESTC editors first authorized embedded error reports like the DFONOTES more than fifteen years ago, the assumption was that most of the reported problems would be resolved fairly quickly. This has not proved to be possible.” (375)
“With the probability (as my survey implies) that ESTC has a minimum of 80,000 records containing at least one error in description, a rigorous programme of rematches is clearly not feasible.” (375)
Do any of Tabor’s three proposals end up being adopted?
“the lack of compulsion to declare a work ‘finished’ is a great advantage of the online environment. One expects ESTC to be a work in progress more or less in perpetuity, and that is a strength not a liability as long as net order in the file increases.” (375)
“Six years ago an article appeared with a provocative title: ‘Who Will Edit the ESTC?’.34 By now the answer should be obvious: ESTC will never be edited, in the sense of being anything like a finished, comprehensive, and consistently accurate catalogue.” (384)

“Is it not                                         better to display all of these informal notes rather than presenting a                                         smoother façade to the public, showing some records whose accuracy or                                         completeness is known to be doubtful while concealing the evidence pending                                         eventual resolution? The answer depends on how one expects the file will be                                         used — whether the market is the picture-book audience or the topographic                                        map audience.” (376)
“Bibliographers, like academics in any field, need to beware of making unqualified statements in cases where doubts exist.” (376)
“Electronic records, like individual copies of books, habent sua fata. The ESTC records contain clues to their own provenance that can help more experienced users to recognize what David McKitterick has called ‘nuances of responsibility’.” (376)
“The building of ESTC has relied from the start mostly on direct reports of holdings from whatever libraries could be persuaded to generate and donate them. As the last few of my examples demonstrate, however, a great deal of information of potential interest to ESTC passes through the biblio- graphical community every day from a variety of sources. Some of it is anecdotal, some appears in antiquarian book catalogues and scholarly publications. For various reasons ESTC has never been very efficient at tap- ping these sources. In the last part of this paper I will discuss how the file reflects this isolation, and what may be done to lower the barriers between it and the bibliographical community.” (379)
“ By omitting to consult even the most basic biblio- graphical journals, the ESTC editors allow gaps to widen between the file and current knowledge.” (380)
“Even if ESTC took advantage of these broader sources, there is no guaran- tee that scholarly findings would translate securely to catalogue format. My final example will show how the diffuse authorship of ESTC can undermine its control of more complex bibliographical problems.” (380)
p.384: The point of my last example is that some problems in ESTC are better understood, and would perhaps be better handled, by amateur bibliographers rather than professional cataloguers. By amateur bibliographers I mean generally teaching academics, usually in English or history, but occasionally booksellers or even the odd curator
p.384: What these people want most from ESTC is simply for it to tell the truth about physical copies. All of them have new information that they would like to contribute to the file, and all of them can supply lists of errors and new locations. They are the best authorities we have.
p.385: there is a widespread feeling among these potential contributors to the file that the staff already have their hands full, and that new information tends to go into a box, not to be seen again … There is a need on the one hand and a willingness to provide on the other, but the supplies are not getting through. 
p.385: I have a proposal that can help bridge this gap without placing further commitments on ESTC staff. I believe the editors should consider allowing editorial access to the file to a few outside volunteers already trained in ESTC conventions. These volunteers would receive and assess new findings from the bibliographical community, and where appropriate incorporate them into ESTC.
p.386: To maintain its authority, its editors need to accept fully ESTC’s responsibilities as a definitive bibliographical resource. They can do so by reaffirming a basic commitment to accuracy, by allowing users to view all the information they need to use the file wisely, and by opening a wider door to those who have drawn benefits from ESTC, and who now bear benefits in return.</Text>

are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?
if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format (though I could add people who wrote plays!!)
and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?
or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More &amp; Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”

            <Text>The 1790s in Digital Archives: A Meta-Analysis of Holdings
A major concern regarding digital humanities research is the ability of findings to be “representative.” There is broad understanding that digital archives contain gaps, but little specific knowledge of the nature of those gaps. My project is analogous to a scientific meta-analysis, comparing several major digital collections. I consider all works published in Britain between 1789 and 1799 across six digital archives. The collections examined are heterogeneous, ranging from 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue to 466 XML files created by the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership. I use a range of approaches, including topic modelling, to identify what kinds of literature each corpus emphasizes, and what omissions and errors scholars must be aware of. By comparing the holdings and metadata of these collections, this paper lays groundwork for future scholars to work with digital corpora in a nuanced, selective way.

            <Text>“After publishing her first major volume of poems in 1791, Mary Robinson made her sensational debut as a novelist in 1792 with Vancenza; Or, the Dangers of Credulity. Reputedly selling out before noon on the first day of publication, the two-volume novel set in fifteenth-century Spain reads, in some places, much like a Radcliffian re-telling of Robinson’s scandal- ous love affair with the Prince of Wales in 1780. … If Vancenza exemplifies Robinson’s tendency to revise the story of her life and turn it into novelistic capital, however, the cautionary tale also evinces her desire to claim moral authority in a public sphere where she had earlier won somewhat dubious celebrity as an actress, a royal mistress, and a flamboyant woman of fashion. By the end of Van- cenza, Robinson’s didactic voice is almost indistinguishable from that of her fictional Marchioness de Vallorie, a ‘gracefully majestic’ figure who not only warns against ‘the dangers and calamities to which [unprotected women] are exposed’ but also recommends ‘the laudable pursuits of mental culti- vation’ over ‘the tinsel blandishments of fashionable folly’.3 More impor- tantly perhaps, the Marchioness echoes the radical discourse of the 1790s as she decries the ‘empty distinctions’ of rank and wealth. Characterized as an ‘affectionate monitress’ and an ‘excellent preceptress’, the Marchio- ness figures Robinson’s reinvention of herself as a moralist, one who would ultimately claim affiliation with the radical school of Mary Wollstonecraft rather than with the conservative camp of Hannah More.” (Setzer 56)

“After Vancenza, Robinson made more controversial bids for moral author- ity as she wove explicit critiques of contemporary social and political injustices into the sentimental fabric of six subsequent novels set in the turbulent 1790s: The Widow (1794), Angelina (1796), Hubert de Sevrac (1796), Walsingham (1797), The False Friend (1799), and The Natural Daughter (1799). Accord- ing to conservative commentators in the late 1790s, Robinson’s fame as a poet was seriously compromised by her association with Joseph Johnson’s circle of radical authors, which included Wollstonecraft, Mary Hays, and William Godwin. In his satiric poem The Pursuits of Literature, Thomas / 
James Mathias associated Robinson with Charlotte Smith, Elizabeth Inchbald, and other nameless women writers who were so ‘frequently whin- ing and frisking in novels’ that ‘girls’ heads turn wild with impossible adven- tures, and now and then are tainted with democracy’.5 Taking inspiration from Mathias, the Reverend Richard Polwhele included Robinson in a despi- cable Jacobin band of ‘unsex’d females’ led by Wollstonecraft.6 
Although recent scholarship has called attention to the emergence of a radical feminist voice in Robinson’s fiction, her epistolary novel Angelina typically receives no more than a passing nod.7 One noteworthy exception is Adriana Craciun’s overview of Robinson’s radical politics, which includes a consideration of Angelina as a ‘feminist meditation on arbitrary power, one in dialogue with Godwin and written by a close friend who addressed him as “my dear Philosopher”’.8 While this characterization of Angelina usefully foregrounds the radical sentiments expressed in the novel, it distorts the chronology of Robinson’s friendship with Godwin. Citing evidence in Godwin’s diary, biographers concur that he did not meet Robinson until 9 February 1796, more than a month after the publication of Angelina.9 A more substantive issue, however, is the complete effacement of Wollstone- craft’s influence in the textual genesis of Angelina. Although I do not dispute Craciun’s claim that it enters into ‘dialogue’ with Godwin’s Caleb Williams (1794), I aim to show how Angelina is also a fictional mobilization of radical precepts articulated in Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). As I read the novel, it is ultimately not so much a ‘meditation on arbitrary power’ as it is a polemical intervention in the 1790s war of ideas.” (56-7)</Text>

            <Text>p.165: The familiar associations of the multicultural debates with the so-called canon debates often depend on an oversimplification. 
p.165: John Guillory's book usefully troubles such reductive correlations.
p.166: Thus the dilemma of liberal pluralism: of wanting simultaneously to integrate excluded minority works into a reorganized yet once more unified canon and to preserve what is understood as cultural difference.
p.166: The syllabus is the "institutional form" of linguistic and symbolic capital (ix), which capital is more critical than the ideological content of individual works in determining access to literacy, Guillory argues, developing Bourdieu's insistence on a cultural as well as an economic account of class difference.
p.166: The limitations of Guillory's critique are most visible when he presents case studies. Guillory provides no real account of what, at a given moment in institutional and cultural history, determines the valorization of some works over others.
p.167: Today the category of "literature" carries the stigma of institutional "dysfunctionality" as the traditional cultural capital of a tired bourgeoisie. This is due to the rise, Guillory reminds us, of what Alvin Gouldner called the "professional-managerial class" which has made obsolete the cultural capital represented by bothcanonical and noncanonical literature. To the professional-managerial class, the canon debate is a convenient irrelevance, for it distracts attention from its own cultural capital—real power that increasingly threatens to maroon the participants in the canon debates "on an ever shrinking island within the university itself" (45).
p.167: Guillory's interest is to reprise aesthetic value qua cultural capital, in order to resist its reduction to the "quasi-economic concept of 'use-value'" and to recognize the distinction between cultural and material capital
p.168: Perhaps the most valuable aspect of Guillory's analysis is that it is still among the most minutely argued and provocative attempts of the 1990s to reconceive the canon debates and disentangle them from the multiculturalist debates. It hints at the possibilities of a more class-sensitive critique of the dissemination of cultural values via the canon. But in seeking to reterritorialize the canon debate, Guillory constricts the scope of this very cultural critique.
p.168: Ultimately Guillory seems not to grasp the forces of the public sphere that drive the canon debates into energetic articulation with the multiculturalist debates.</Text>

            <Title>ch 3 - lingering legacies</Title>
            <Text>Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? As in my first chapter, the “case study” texts for this chapter will emerge from my broader research. I am particularly eager to investigate timely re-stagings of plays, given the heightened ephemerality and thus timeliness of theatrical productions compared to print; my first step is to assemble a precise timeline of what was staged during the period. For printed works, some initial exploration suggests that Shakespeare, Oliver Goldsmith, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Johnson, or Milton might be of interest. I will need to determine what distinction, if any, I might want to draw between “canonical” authors like Shakespeare and Milton, whose posthumous prominence is predictable, and any shorter-lived targeted reprintings that I might discover. This chapter, then, is another way of engaging with the idea of “legacy,” exploring the distinctions between “timelessness” and “lasting timeliness.”</Text>

            <Text>This provoked William Molyneux’s influential Case of Ireland (1698), which reached a tenth edition by 1782.11 Molyneux’s book was a protest against metropolitan policies, fashioned into a federal interpretation of the regal union. Ireland, he insisted, was equal in status to England, a ‘separate and distinct kingdom’ with its own supreme parliament, not subject to English jurisdiction. Although Molyneux’s book has sometimes been interpreted as a textbook of ‘colonial nationalism’, he was no modern ‘nationalist’, having no interest in cultural identity or in breaking the regal connection. As a member of the Protestant settler ‘Ascendancy’, he ignored the Catholic majority of Ireland, who did not begin to find their own patriot voice until the 1750s, in Charles O’Connor’s writings. Molyneux took for granted a common inheritance of ancestral English liberties ‘enjoyed under the crown of England for above five hundred years’. In fact, he was not necessarily averse to an incorporating union as a solution to Ireland’s unequal treatment, a union by which Irish members would be elected to an imperial parliament in London, provided that such a union would indeed bring full economic equality. This was a case more fully explored in Henry Maxwell’s Essay towards an Union of Ireland with England (1703). Much later, when the Irish parliament did achieve considerably greater autonomy, Molyneux’s remark in favour of full union was suppressed in the edition of his book published in 1782.

            <Title>1790s canon debate</Title>
            <Text>The problem of evaluating literature is not a new or a simple one. In the eighteenth century, the debate took the form of urgently needing to distinguish ‘trash’ from ‘treasure’. Michael Gamer, in Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation, highlights the role of the eighteenth-century reviewer as a crucial mediator between the writers and readers of books. Importantly, although the assessments take the form of reviews of individual works, Gamer also argues that the critics’ objections are in fact “a regulatory discourse – carried out under the fiction of paternalistic advice to a given gothic writer, but functioning as an implicit threat to other readers and writers” that affiliation with the gothic comes with “cultural costs” (42). The gothic stands in as a proxy for any kind of “popular” reading that takes place “in the absence of formal education and training” (57), so a denunciation of a gothic work becomes a reaffirmation of class-based literary hierarchies. In other words, these reviews create and affirm the cultural capital of a category of ‘serious’ literature. Gamer is only concerned with the gothic and romanticism, but the overall regulatory function of literary reviewers as moral arbiters— and the stock conventionality of their objections, which do not affect the actual production or consumption of the works attacked— applies to most forms of writing in the period. For example, George Taylor sees the same dynamic in the theatre. In The French Revolution and the London Stage, he argues that, “[c]ritics might make sharp comparisons” between the many kinds of entertainments that were staged, “but little of the programme was dismissed [by audiences] as ‘trash', or ‘immoral', or irrelevant ‘fancy’” (3). Taylor sees the repetitive discourse of eighteenth century literary critics as proof of a larger social divide: “Disagreement as to what is trash and what is treasure suggests cultural crisis, when values are put under question by social stress or political conflict” (3). Gamer and Taylor both suggest that moral judgment of literature by its critics was driven by social friction, rather than by the aesthetic distinctions which they claimed as their motivation.</Text>
            <Comments>Reviewers sought to dictate the social assessment of individual literary works in order to enforce morality for society at large.[ The emerging idea of the public sphere (cf Habermas) in the eighteenth century brought with it an urgent task of literary assessment. — this is true but maybe I don’t have to say it! and then I don’t have to waste time talking about Habermas] [They basically say so themselves in their reviews—I’ll quote a juicy representative one.] 
The really clever bit of Gamer’s argument is that he then unpacks how Romantics, especially Wordsworth, use just enough Gothic material to sell their books while also repeating these conventional attacks on the Gothic — they get to have their cake and eat it too, pursuing both financial and cultural capital. But I don’t think that’s relevant here.</Comments>

Popular radical print culture: ‘the more public the better’

Page 35:
Founded in January 1792 by a London shoemaker, Thomas Hardy, and a group of friends, the LCS is commonly seen as the key organisation in the emergence of a new kind of popular radicalism.

Page 35:
Proposing an unlimited membership and charging a cheap subscription rate of one penny per week, the LCS aimed to broaden the processes of political discussion and the printed circulation of ideas.

Page 35:
Modern historians, especially since the revival of scholarly interest in popular conservatism in the 1980s, have been inclined to celebrate the initiative displayed by the LCS, but disparage a perceived lack of cogency in its political platform.

Page 35:
The fact of major differences within the reform movement is undeniable, but that is hardly a surprise if we examine any reform or revolutionary movement, successful or otherwise. In the case of the 1790s, this diversity reflects the experimental nature of the movement as it faced a range of new possibilities in the wake of the American and French Revolutions.

Page 36
Page 36:
If the LCS and its members critiqued the theatricality of Pitt and others as an empty show, a shabby trick played to deceive the people, they also insisted on their right to produce a drama of their own, with starring roles for radical celebrities.

Page 36:
My approach thinks of the LCS in relation to language as embedded in social practices and understands contests over those practices as essential to the politics of the radical movement. The LCS is read not as some absolutely coherent agent, but as a locus for the circulation of print structured by reading, meetings, lectures, conversazione, various encounters in bookshops and many other spaces in the associational world of eighteenth-century London.

Page 36:
the politics of the radical societies may not lie simply with the speech act in the text, but in ‘the very act of publication’.

Page 36:
If this book ends with a defeat of a kind in the passage of the Two Acts through Parliament at the end of 1795, then the triumph of the radicalism of the 1790s was the creation of a popular

Page 37
Page 37:
politics that extended into the nineteenth century.

Page 37:
Over 1793–4, as John Barrell has shown, Pitt’s ministry began to construe these arguments not only as seditious but also treasonable in so far as they presented the popular societies as more legitimately representing the people than Parliament.

Page 38
Page 38:
Eley may be right to note that ‘the advanced democracy of the LCS presumed the very maturity and sophistication it was meant to create’.

Page 38:
the struggle to create a democratic culture in the popular societies was a sustained and extraordinarily rich response that seriously alarmed the government of the day and prompted it to take measures.12 Many contemporaries – not only radicals – regarded these measures as both unnecessary and unprecedented.

Page 38:
Charles James Fox described Pitt’s measures culminating in the Two Acts as a ‘Reign of Terror’.

Page 38:
The most obvious fruit of the collaboration between the LCS and the SCI was the circulation of cheap editions of Paine’s Rights of Man, but their relationship continued in one form or another, and with different degrees of intensity, from 1792 until the treason trials at the end of 1794.

Page 39
Page 39:
Some key individuals, for instance, Joseph Gerrald, were members of both societies

Page 40
Page 40:
The question of how a distinctive republic of letters could have emerged from such places remained an enigma to a ruling elite

Page 40:
Radical print culture in the 1790s was structured as much by tensions between its members as their cooperative will to change their world for the better.

Page 40:
The disorientating speed of events that the French Revolution unleashed across Europe further complicated things, as participants had to decide upon the significance of those events for their sense of what was possible in the British situation.

Page 40:
When we examine the archive of the radical movement in London, a picture emerges of less-heralded individual members of the LCS and SCI also revising their sense of the possibilities before them, even if the official line of the societies stuck to the Duke of Richmond’s plan of universal suffrage and annual parliaments as their immediate objective.

Page 40:
John Horne Tooke famously described his attitude to reform in terms of getting off the Windsor coach at Hounslow, even if his fellow passengers intended to proceed to the terminus. The LCS encouraged all the societies to get on the stage to Richmond and debate the final destination once on board.

Page 40:
hey continually recycled resources from the past, often quite literally by republishing the duke’s plan from the 1780s, or even earlier texts from the commonwealth canon.

Page 40:
The cutting and pasting techniques that were essential to the rapid-fire achievement of periodicals like Thomas Spence’s Pig’s Meat (1793–5) or Eaton’s Politics for the People (1793–5) did not simply endorse the texts they reproduced, but implicitly transformed them in the interests of raising the political consciousness of their readers.</Text>

            <Text>“The shift from conventional parable to a more ambitious fictional synthesis of the whole machinery of moral reform involves More in a complex and frankly promotional set of references to her own activity.” (497)

“This glimpse into the contractual foundations of a political economy of charitable relief vividly confirms Dorice Elliott’s argument that More treated charity as a form of exchange, in which the female philanthropic benefactor acquires ‘the right and responsibility . . . to superintend those she relieves.’” (497)

To be clear, my point is not that we should substitute More for Burke as the avatar of reaction in Britain; the cultural field is too uneven to be represented by any single writer or activist. Yet More’s career does usefully shift our attention away from the twin poles of a reconstructed debate (Burke/Paine), which never really occurred in the way we tend to imagine, and towards a set of literary texts, whose remarkable conditions of production suggest not abstract ideological positions but the social and cultural conditions under which political expres- sion and persuasion actually took place.16 As More herself observed, the French Revolution occurred at a time when “an appetite for reading had, from a variety of causes, been increased among the inferior ranks in this country,” and the Cheap Repository was designed “to supply such wholesome aliment as might give a new direction to their taste, and abate their relish for . . . corrupt and inflammatory publications” (5:vii–viii). If, for Romanticist readers, the language of this passage brings to mind William Wordsworth’s 1800 preface to Lyrical Ballads, where voracious reading habits and revolutionary upheaval also threaten “the present state of the public taste in this country,” this unexpected intersection of two very different literary careers should encourage us to reconsider the Cheap Repository as the most institutionally ambitious, and arguably the most influential, of the many Romantic-period efforts to create the taste by which a new literature was to be enjoyed.17 (502)</Text>

            <Title>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993</Title>
            <Text>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993) goes furthest in investigating the cultural and political significance of the also very neglected gothic plays – a ‘popular literary mode’ in the 1780s and a ‘mania’ in the 1790s (149). In Backscheider’s analysis these plays were easily applicable to the politics of the 1790s, over and over again depicting villainous aristocrats violating the sanctity of life, liberty, property and female chastity, and powerful crowds able to overthrow them. But, she quickly adds, ‘Year by year, the plays show stronger and stronger strategies of containment’ (226). They characterise mob-rule as being just as inimical as despotism, and they represent the virtuous and legitimate protagonists as able to conquer abuses and restore order though non-confrontational means. Ultimately then, the plays ‘propagated a comforting vision of community, of human nature, and of a providential, benignly ordered world’ (232). More powerfully still, they provided a safety valve for a nervous and agitated public: 
By acting out repressed anxieties and hopes in overt and symbolic representations, the plays released tensions and made social contradictions momentarily innocuous. Social antagonism became opportunities to demonstrate the idealized British self-image and to confirm that no revolution was needed in their country . . . The aristocrats could be restrained and the poor would be taken care of . . . Conflict became spectacle, a containable and consumable product. (233)

            <Title>OGS Plan of Study 2019</Title>
            <Text>Plan of Study 
In literary study, scholars increasingly embrace the methods of “distant reading” to study hundreds or thousands of texts using computational tools. As an alternative to “close reading” (the practice of meticulously reading and researching the language of small selections of individual texts), distant reading promised an exciting opportunity to expand the borders of which literature would merit serious attention. However, in the nearly twenty years since Franco Moretti coined the term “distant reading” in his “Conjectures on World Literature,” the introduction of computation has not changed the preference for a limited, selective canon. A recent article by Kathleen Bode exemplifies a current shift in digital humanities research. Bode critiques pioneers of distant reading and literary macroanalysis Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they use as proof of their arguments. As an alternative, Bode calls for an integration of computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history, which she terms a “data-rich literary history.” My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799, to redefine our understanding of the definitive works of this decade. 
Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building (that is, the accumulation of a large body of text files for analysis) to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to explore how works from this eleven-year “decade” have been selected as important, literary, or popular. For this period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts — the source for most distant reading research on eighteenth century literature — includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? 
My experiments examine six major databases to answer these questions: The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. For each database, I download their holdings identified as printed in England 1789-1799. I calculate how many works are attributed to male, female, or unknown authors. I then examine the contents of each database more closely, to compare the inclusion of broad categories of writing like poetry, drama, prose fiction, sermons, non-fiction, and ephemera. Identifying these categories of writing within each corpus reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry (rather than non-fiction or sermons) in the smaller databases. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation. If novels are mostly written by women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of selection. 
I have completed my data collection, begun writing the necessary code to carry out my experiments, and written my first chapter. The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the sixth year of my PhD, during which I will complete code development and write two chapters.

            <Text>Writing Timeliness
Whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand, texts take on shifting meanings as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and recontextualized over time. The changing impact of works over time is most obvious in overtly political works like Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, whose relationship with, for example, Helen Maria Williams’ Letters from France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men was directly determined by the extent to which the works in question were considered to have been borne out by political events. But time-sensitive readings, and an expected textual responsiveness for current events, extended to to literary works as well.
Novels which, in scholarly editions, give the illusion of being singular, unified objects are nearly all the result of a more complicated and responsive process of coming into being. As Tristram Shandy was composed and published, for example, each new installment slightly shifted its emphasis, so that the emerging narrative only gradually solidified into what are, in retrospect, its major concerns. Particularly notable is the way that volumes 7 through 9 of Tristram Shandy, written after the publication of The Castle of Otranto, incorporate Gothic materials differently than the earlier volumes; rather than being one text with one interpretation of the role of the supernatural in heightening readerly emotion, Shandy was a phenomenon which unfolded and varied over time. Even works which were not printed in installments, like Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and Walter Scott’s Waverley, could change in content and in popular reception with a new edition.
Similarly, Lyrical Ballads is often studied in the context of its 1798, 1800, and 1802 editions, but William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge seem to have been following standard poetic practice by writing new prefaces, selecting new poems, and re-editing their works for a new emphasis. Charlotte Smith enacts similar changes across the dozen editions of Elegiac Sonnets printed between 1784 and 1812. Smith’s 1797 edition, for example, includes a new preface, re-selects the non-sonnet poems, and adds new sonnets to create a “new” work out of poems which were as many as thirteen years old. The edition presents her as a politically engaged poet, directly relevant to the events of her day, whose radical philosophies are salient even in her earliest sonnets.</Text>

            <Text>To navigate the 1790s, I turn to four authors whose careers and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature. These authors are Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Ann Radcliffe. All four authors were highly productive in the 1790s, and all four had complex and contested literary legacies after the 1790s. As literary scholars re-assess ideas about literary seriousness, popularity, and women’s writing, our assessment of these authors has shifted as well. By examining their bibliographies with computational methods, I again ask how they might look different if we look at them a different way. In the following chapters of this dissertation, I will ask whether and how contemporary digital archives make these authors visible. To introduce each of those chapters, I provide here a brief overview of each author’s major works, general biography, and critical reception.</Text>

            <Text>“Smith’s continuing presence in the writings of her contemporaries and successors provides a barometer both of her own reputation and, more important, of the varieties of influence and authority she exerted upon the British Romantic literary community. While these writings testify to her poetry’s centrality to the literary culture, they also indicate the paradigmatic value — especially for women writers — of a writer whose personal difficulties were widely known and who achieved commercial success in part because of the skill with which she mythologized her own physical and psychological experience in poems whose evocative power touched the lives and experiences of many contemporaries. This essay examines a range of the responses —  by both canonical writers like Wordsworth and unfamiliar ones like Mariann Dark, Martha Hanson and Thomas Gent — to Smith’s poetry in particular, including public testimonials that appeared in the periodical press following her death. It considers how these responses, which continued into the 1820s, contributed to the myth-making that Smith’s own writings — including the often intensely personal pleading prefaces to her novels — encouraged among writers who read her poetry with care and with empathy. The essay … documents the extensive literary community that was united — at least briefly and circumstantially — through the common theme of Smith and her writing.” (Behrendt 189)

Robinson and Smith both received posthumous attention in 1806-8. Robinson’s reception is negative, dismissing her claims to sympathy and sensibility, and critiquing her immoral personal choices (Behrendt190). Smith is praised for “a familiar catalogue of the characteristics of Smith’s life and work: the pervasive tone of melancholy, the life of illness and suffering, the remarkable productivity in multiple genres.” (Behrendt 191).

“Smith had produced a total of sixty-three volumes, including poetry, novels, translations and books for children” Behrendt(191)

“The tone of the two reviews could not be more different, nor could the moral, political, and ideological judgments that inform them. And yet both authors did in fact suffer physically, emotionally, and certainly economically; both expressed in their works their indignation over the injustice of it all, especially as women trapped in a system which denied them personal and property rights; both suffered reversals in public reputation (and consequently in fortune, or income) when they expressed their political and social dissent; both embodied their personal suffering in their poetry’s (and their prose’s) personae; both died relatively young; both largely disappeared from the landscape of Romantic-era British literary history in the following century and a half; and both have been recovered and favourably assessed in recent decades.” (Behrendt 191)

Mary Robinson’s “notorious public behaviour seems to have ensured that she would not get anything like a fair hearing as an artist among the conventional critics of the time. Her case is a painful reminder of the pervasive power of a self-appointed coterie of predominantly male critics who considered themselves custodians of national public morality.” (192) “unlike Smith she was widely regarded as the instigator rather than the victim of her misfortunes” (192)
“even though… Robinson’s love poems were ‘immensely popular’ during her lifetime [cite: J Labbe “Selling One’s Sorrows” p 70)], her novels sold well, and her Lyrical Tales of 1800 seemed poised to rival the Lyrical Ballads” (192)

She became so inspirational of future great poets that she was forgotten in their shadows..? (193-4)

“The fact is that widespread evidence of Smith’s influence abounds, especially in poems composed during or soon after her lifetime.” (194)
“testify not only to Smith’s pervasive influence on the poetry, but also to the extent to which the Romantic writing community was an interactive and dialogic one in which intertextuality of this sort was clearly deliberate in some cases and probably unintentional in others.” (194)

p 195: men assessed by their work, women by their life first (Robinson dismissed for both simultaneously)

“Because traditional literary history has customarily privileged male writers at the expense of female ones, for much of the last century and a half Smith (like many other women) was routinely relegated to the margins when she was remembered at all. Thus William Lisle Bowles was widely credited with resurrecting the sonnet with the publication of his Fourteen Sonnets in 1789, a misperception to which Coleridge perhaps unintentionally contributed in the Biographia Literaria, where he praises those sonnets without mentioning Smith, whose own sonnets predated Bowles’s by some five years and demonstrably influenced them. At the time, thought, many writers saw matters correctly” (Behrendt 196)

p 196-7: Smith’s strategic persona presenting herself as a damsel in distress to shield from criticism for writing, and indeed to market her writing (all cited from Labbe)

“the memorial poems that we trace to male poets frequently subscribe to the pseudo-chivalric paradigm” often presenting themselves as rescuers, but “poems written by women take a different approach to Smith” (197). “women’s resonate with a much more immediately personal and less hierarchical sense of community, one of emulation, nurturance, and shared experience” (198)

“women readers in general, and women writers in particular, read in Smith’s life and works a different message” (197) “she naturally struck many women as proof positive of the impossibility for even a woman of extraordinary talent, energy, and resilience to ‘make it’. At the same time, however, her life and her undeniable literary achievements reminded those same contemporaries of the nobility — even the heroism — of the struggle she waged” (198)

“Not surprisingly, few authors of the period wrote in much detail about Smith’s direct influences upon their works, although it is clear from sonnets like Bowles’s, Coleridge’s, Wordsworth’s, Opie’s, Hanson’s, Dark’s, Keats’s, and even Anna Seward’s that her influence was wide, formative, and powerful, just as it was in prose fiction for novelists like Austen, Radcliffe, Opie, Scott and others. Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain), while there is no question that her life itself continued to hold real interest for many — and especially for many women — in the first several decades following her death.” (Behrendt 201).

“poetry had always been for her less a commercial venture than a conversation with and among other enlightened minds — both other poets and discriminating readers — in which her participation was not a ‘profession’ (as novel-writing was) but a genuine vocation.” (201)

“It may have taken the better part of two centuries for literary history to prove her correct, but Smith has been vindicated as artist, as thinker and as woman by a new and growing community of sympathy who have once again found in her life and works an irrepressible spirit, keen even in adversity, and a mind and sensibility that is everywhere dedicated to the community of human experience, in all its afflictions and glories. This is the Charlotte Smith whose experience spoke with particular clarity and urgency to nineteenth-century British women, who found in her ability to connect and to articulate her own personal suffering with the ways of the broad public world a consolation, a guide and an inspiration.” (Behrendt 202)</Text>

            <Title>novels mention but don't always show ballads</Title>
            <Text>The poetry certainly circulated outside its novelistic content -- in the case of Udolpho, two of the main character's poems were actually published separately in periodicals beforethe novel. But the songs and poems included in novels seem to be there in part to "elevate" and grant respectability to the fiction -- Udolpho mentions a ballad, but doesn't print it. So perhaps the somewhat disreputable nature of popular ballads could be tempered by literary or moral intervention, but only when that was the only literary project going.

            <Text>Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical — or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream” — printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a taxonomy of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and of authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, and what kind of “alternatives” they offer to the mainstream. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices within the horizon of expectations of the radical circles I (and other scholars) expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.
TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.
TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.</Comments>

            <Title>Lesser &amp; Farmer debate</Title>
            <Text>A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer &amp; Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.”

Blayney believes that Lesser &amp; Farmer attempt to disprove his “one inescapable fact about printed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been” (7). But what really matters to him about identifying the “best-selling moneyspinners” of the day is not the ‘moneyspinning’ — the question of whether, when a publisher bought a play, he was making a sound financial decision — but about the cultural centrality of ‘bestsellers’. The total market share of religious texts matters, not because it meant that publishers turned their highest profits off of religious texts, but because “[c]ustomers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other ‘literary’ publications,” evidence of “just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers” (7). Lesser and Farmer do not contradict the importance of religious texts to readers. But, in setting out “not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (F&amp;L 213), they make the case that books with low market share, books that are not “best-selling,” could nonetheless be “moneyspinners.” Their rebuttal states that “...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low” (F&amp;L 213), but what they leave somewhat unstated is: “in high demand” with whom?

My own work seeks to examine reprints, but in a more limited fashion than Farmer &amp; Lesser were able to do. Rather than determine the reprint rate of various kinds of fiction, I carry out a Blayney-style examination of pure market share. I seek to identify reprints in order to determine the market share of new versus reprinted material in any given year. </Text>

            <Title>debt vs credit</Title>
            <Text>It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit
It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing to promise repayment) and then 80% of the time we’re told that he did follow up and repay
Are the screeds against debt in the same works...? I’ll have to check, but I THINK there’s a distinction being made between “credit” (which is tied to social credibility) and “debt” (which is seen as impersonal and with near-mystical properties)
Similarly peasants can live like 5 years in a cottage without paying rent and they’ll get around to it when the landlord asks them, and this too is not “debt”, in fact at the start of the century it’s a narrative marker of cruelty for the landlord to insist on the rent being paid
Ok, those are my thoughts on credit vs debt as part of the shift from parochial economies to imperial market capitalism</Text>

            <Title>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems</Title>
            <Text>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems (1986). Writing broadly in the tradition of Marxist criticism Levinson theorised interestingly about the relationship between history and literature in her Rethinking Historicism (1989), but it was her new readings of ostensibly unpolitical poems such as the ‘Intimations of Immortality’ ode and ‘Tintern Abbey’ in the earlier book which have had the most lasting effect. For her, political events were vital in shaping Wordsworth’s verse, even when they were apparently absent. His choice of images could reveal the link Levinson argued. An apparently innocuous reference to a solitary ‘tree’, for example, might allude to the French tree of liberty, or his ‘single field’ to the Champ de Mars. But it was the omissions that were more important, representing a deliberate suppression of political optimism and its replacement with a new system of belief, the ‘myth of the soul’ at the core of the Intimations ode. For the disenchanted Wordsworth, latching on to new ideals in the poem,‘there are victories’, wrote Levinson, 
far greater than those once anticipated from the French Revolution. Rather than grieve over those mundane losses, the reader is exhorted to set his sights on those other and spiritual palms . . . the ‘soothing thoughts that spring / Out of human suffering.’ (Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems 93–4, 98–9) 
Such an approach has perhaps proved so influential because it helps to explain, and perhaps even authorise, Wordsworth’s rather forlorn retreat from his youthful idealism. </Text>

            <Title>all Radcliffe editions</Title>
            <Text>Ann Radcliffe stands in contrast to More, Smith, and Robinson in many ways. One of these is the relative brevity of her bibliography. She published six works during this dissertation’s decade of interest— five novels and a volume of travel writing— and this is all that is published during her lifetime. Where her bibliography grows extensive is the number of reprintings. Although this dissertation will consider only those works published in England, the following chronology of Radcliffe’s editions includes international editions as an indication of Radcliffe’s reach.
In 1789, Radcliffe publishes The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne in London. In 1790, A Sicilian Romance in London. In 1792, The Romance of the Forest appears in London and in Dublin. This novel earns her more positive notice and revives interest in the first two. Athlin &amp; Dunbayne also has its first Dublin edition in 1792, and Sicilian Romance has a second London edition and a German translation in Hannover. In 1793, Athlin &amp; Dunbayne has a second London edition, and Romance of the Forest a second Dublin edition, as well as a German translation in Leipzig. In 1794, Radcliffe publishes her fourth novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho, which has three total editions that year, two in London and one in Dublin. 1794 also sees the continued popularity of Romance of the Forest in a second London edition and a French translation in Paris. In 1795, Radcliffe publishes her only non-novel work, the travelogue A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794, which saw two editions in London, one edition in Dublin, and a French translation in Paris all in the year of its release. 1795 also saw the increased reach of Radcliffe’s other works: Sicilian Romance has its first American edition; Romance of the Forest two American editions; and Udolpho reached its third London edition, second Dublin edition, first American edition, and its first German translation. In 1796, Radcliffe published no new works, but Athlin &amp; Dunbayne saw its first American edition; Sicilian Romance reached its third London edition; and Romance of the Forest reached its third London edition and its second French edition in Paris. In 1797, she publishes the last new novel to be released during her lifetime, The Italian. In its first year, The Italian has one edition in London, one in Dublin, two editions in America, two French editions in Paris, and a German edition in Konigsberg. 1797 also sees the first French editions of Athlin &amp; Dunbayne, Sicilian Romance, and Udolpho. In 1798, there are no domestic editions of Radcliffe, but many international: Sicilian Romance has its second and third French editions; Romance of the Forest has its third French edition; Udolpho has its second French edition and second German edition; The Italian has its third French edition. In 1799, Athlin &amp; Dunbayne has its third London edition; Romance of the Forest its fourth London edition; Journey in Summer 1794 its second French edition; and The Italian its fourth French edition.
After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Radcliffe’s works continued to be reprinted domestically and internationally frequently. In 1800, Romance of the Forest reaches its third Dublin edition, and its fourth French edition; Udolpho reaches its third Dublin edition, and its second American edition. In 1801, Sicilian Romance reaches its fourth French edition and The Italian its second German edition. In 1802, Romance of the Forest reaches its fifth French edition. Also in 1802, Radcliffe wrote, but did not publish, Gaston de Blondville, which would finally appear in print posthumously in 1826. In 1803, Romance of the Forest reached its third American edition, and Udolpho its fifth London edition. In 1804, unusually, no works appeared under Radcliffe’s name. In 1805, The Italian reaches its second Dublin edition. In 1806, Romance of the Forest reaches its fifth London edition, and Udolpho its sixth and seventh London editions. In 1807, again, no works appear. In 1808, Udolpho reaches its third French edition in Paris, and also seems to have been printed in an English edition in Paris; The Italian reaches its fifth French edition. In 1809, Sicilian Romance reaches its fourth London edition, and Udolpho its eighth London edition. In 1810, Romance of the Forest reaches its sixth London edition, Udolpho its ninth London edition, and The Italian its third German edition. In 1811, Athlin &amp; Dunbayne reaches its fourth London edition, and The Italian its second London edition. 1812 and 1813 see no publications. In 1814, Journey in Summer 1794 reaches its third London edition. In 1815, no publications appear. In 1816, a “new” publication appears: an unauthorized volume Poems by Mrs Ann Radcliffe, anthologizing poems previously appearing in her novels. Udolpho also reaches its tenth London edition in 1816, and has its first Italian translation. No works appear in 1817. In 1818, Sicilian Romance has its fifth London edition, and Romance of the Forest has its sixth French edition and a what is probably a Russian translation in Moscow. In 1819, all five novels reach new editions: Athlin &amp; Dunbayne has its second French edition, Sicilian Romance its fifth French edition and first editions in Russian and in Spanish, Romance of the Forest has its seventh London edition, Udolpho its fourth French edition, and The Italian its sixth French edition. In 1820, Sicilian Romance reaches its sixth London edition, Romance of the Forest its eighth London edition, and Udolpho reaches its third American edition and its eleventh and twelfth London editions. In 1821 Athlin &amp; Dunbayne reaches its fifth London edition, and Udolpho its fourth American edition. No editions appear in 1822.
 Radcliffe dies in February of 1823. This prompts reprints of all of her works by S. Fisher in 1823, and by Ballantyne in 1824. In 1826, her husband published several pieces posthumously: a final novel Gaston de Blondeville; a poetic piece St. Alban’s Abbey, a metrical tale; with some poetical pieces...To which is prefixed a memoir of the author, with extracts from her journals; and, in New Monthly Magazine, her unfinished essay “On the Supernatural in Poetry”.</Text>
            <Comments>It’s my intention to produce a bibliography at this level of comprehensiveness for each of my four “key” authors. Perhaps as a table rather than paragraphs??
Radcliffe was paid £500 for this work, which was a highly-anticipated sensation (Facer)

            <Text>I want to both do reparative reading and examine how 18thC audiences might have read reparatively.
I look at literature as something that is always ephemeral and timely, always in a moment that has the potential to be momentous — a play and a song and a novel all have their own ways of occupying the lives of their audiences.
Uses and practices around / with texts
Texts as trying to encourage particular uses, reaching out to particular readers —but not able to control those uses (seriousness always on the verge of parody)</Text>

            <Title>chapbook titles iteratively seek audiences</Title>
            <Text>What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.
I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.</Text>

            <Text>“Divided into three sections, the collection aims, firstly, to address the literary–cultural contexts in which her fictions first circulated, be that in relation to critical assessments of her work in the period 1789–1850, her relation to earlier eighteenth-century writers, her complex political engagements or her singular position within Romantic-era print culture. The chapters in the second section seek to provide a fresh and systematic re-examination of Radcliffe’s œuvre, taking care, in each instance, to situate her works in relation to some of the major preoccupations of Romantic aesthetics. The chapters in the third and final section seek to chart Radcliffe’s relations to Romantic poetry, her influence upon other prose writers of the period and the adaptations of / her popular romances on the Romantic stage. Composed by an international cast of scholars, Ann Radcliffe, Romanticism and the Gothic aims to extend the appreciation of Radcliffe in critical directions that, to date, are only in the early phases of development, particularly with regards to those aspects of her œuvre that lie beyond the narrow confines of the Gothic.” (xiii-xiv)</Text>

            <Text>Philosophical scepticism, the questioning of the adequacy of evidence to justify any view or belief, and the questioning of the criteria for decid- ing intellectual issues in any domain whatsoever, reached its high point in modern philosophy during the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the century the complete edition of Pierre Bayle’s Dictionnaire historique et critique (1702) appeared, raising sceptical problems about matters in philosophy, the- ology, science, and history, and providing what Voltaire called ‘the arsenal of the Enlightenment’. Bishop Pierre Daniel Huet’s Traite ́ philosophique de la faiblesse de l’esprit humain (Treatise on the Weakness of the Human Mind), a forceful presentation of Pyrrhonism, written at the end of the seventeenth century but published posthumously in 1723, became a sensation (Popkin 1993, p. 139). The Traite ́ appeared twice in English, and in Italian, Latin, and German in short order. In 1718 the most scholarly edition of the writ- ing of Sextus Empiricus was published by J. A. Fabricius, with the Greek text and Latin translations. This was soon followed by two printings of a French translation of Sextus’s Hypotyposes (Outlines of Pyrrhonism), and David Hume carried the sceptical analysis of human reasoning to its highest point in his Treatise of Human Nature (1739–40). A mitigated form of scepti- cism was developed by many French Enlightenment thinkers, culminating in the radical scepticism of Jean-Pierre Brissot and Condorcet in the last quarter of the century.

My understanding and use of network analysis is contextualized in light of Wendy Chun’s work on networks in “Queerying Homophily” \cite{Chun:2018tq}. I describe my methodology and its assumptions, and provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.</Text>

“Radcliffe’s heroine in The Italian comes in for relatively little discussion. Perhaps this is because, as Kate Ellis observes, while Udolpho is Radcliffe’s most female-centered novel, The Italian is Radcliffe’s least female-centric novel insofar as its focus is on the developing consciousness of the villain rather than the heroine (TC321). It is interesting in this respect that such a novel should often be regarded as Radcliffe’s best work.” (Rogers 11)</Text>

            <Text>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.</Text>

            <Title>dramatic goals</Title>
            <Text>Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to explore how works from this eleven-year “decade” have been selected as important, literary, or popular. For this period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? My experiments examine six major databases to answer these questions: The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. For each database, I download their holdings identified as printed in England 1789-1799. I identify how many titles the database attributes to each year. I calculate how many works are attributed to male, female, or unknown authors. These very simple pieces of information, when they differ widely between databases, provides the basis for an initial analysis of the assumptions and limitations of each database. I then examine the contents of each database more closely, to compare the inclusion of broad categories of writing like poetry, drama, prose fiction, and ephemera. Identifying these categories of writing within each corpus reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry in the smaller databases. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller databases. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of selection. To ground my analysis in specifics, I take Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, Hannah More, and Ann Radcliffe as case study authors. All four authors have long histories of contentious reception, rooted in debates about seriousness, popularity, and women’s writing. I revisit them to see how their careers might be interpreted through a new lens. I do so, in part, to challenge the contrast drawn between ‘popular’ and ‘serious’ writing, especially in the historical evaluation of women’s writing as literary.</Text>
            <Comments>Google Books and Project Gutenberg are not, of course, traditionally “scholarly” resources, but that is why they form an informative contrast with the other resources examined.
This calculation is carried out by manually examining the metadata of the six corpora I have acquired.
This calculation is carried out by a small, simple program I am writing, described in Appendix A. Because the program just simplifies a straightforward process of counting, it is only lightly theorized in the dissertation itself. 
I already know that ‘titles per year’ are distributed fascinatingly differently between ECCO, ECCO-TCP, ESTC, and HathiTrust
This calculation is carried out by a larger, more complex program I am writing, applying topic modelling to the titles of works. Because it makes several major interpretive choices, it is theorized and discussed in detail when it is applied.</Comments>

            <Text>I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.
I’m interested in strategies of feeling as an ethical concern which lives on today with discussions of reparative reading, and I’m interested in textual timeliness as subject matter that can shed light on the individuality of text’s strategies of feelings through bibliographical and computational research.
My thinking has led me to a methodology, a subject matter, and a philosophical/emotional stance.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change.</Text>

            <Text>“This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is "taken" actively while data is assumed to be a "given" able to be recorded and observed.” (3)
“the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework” … “The graphical force conceals what the statistician knows very well — that no "data" preexist their parameterization” (8)
“the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a "picture" of "data".” (12)
“In some circumstances (the example of the bar chart given earlier that was displaying information about gender, nations, and populations) ambiguity merely requires a higher order level of complexity in the model, so that apparent "certainties" are qualified by variables and nuances that can be specified in mathematical terms. But the idea of capta as fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena, is fundamentally different from the concept of data created as an observer-independent phenomena.” (50)</Text>

            <Text>The central contention of my computational praxis is that, despite the aura of empirical truth which accrues to some ‘scientific’ methodologies and discourses, nothing is neutral/objective. As Johanna Drucker argues, “data” is not neutral/objective. As Safiya Noble and Wendy Chun demonstrate, algorithms are not neutral/objective. As Alberto Cairo shows, graphs and charts are not neutral/objective. Each of these is constructed, by humans, for human purposes, constrained by human biases. As the humanities have long known, of course, things need not be neutral/objective to be meaningful or valuable. By setting aside the desire for a singular neutral/objective truth, we can instead draw quite close to the messy multitudes of truths which enable insight. Accordingly, [CONCLUSION].</Text>

            <Text>‘In 1978, an operational test was conducted in the New York Public Library, under the guidance of Professor Terry Belanger, to assess the methodology of an American counterpart to the British editorial effort. In 1979, this resulted in the formation of the team in Louisiana State University, under the direction of Professor Henry Snyder.” (Crump 105)
”soon after the ESTC cataloguing rules had been established in 1979, a project, based at Munster under the direction of professor Bernhard Fabian, was begun to catalogue the holdings of the University of Gottingen Library to the same standards. This project, the fruits of which will be published in 1986, has enjoyed a close relationship with the British Library editorial office. Where ESTC records already existed, these were adopted as the Gottingen record and only those works not held in the ESTC base file were catalogued again. Similar arrangements were adopted with regard to two parts of the Early Imprints Project (New South Wales and South Australia), which is seeking to record all early imprints in New Zealand and Australia. A catalogue of the Catholic Libraries in Sydney w a s produced earlier this year.” (Crump 105)

“RLIN was chosen because it is an interactive on-line system as opposed to BLAISE/LOCAS (the local
catalogue production service of BLAISE), which updates in batch mode. The terminal in the British Library, soon to be joined by six others, is the first tangible sign of this visionary endeavour. It was anticipated that, with effect from October 1985, both ESTC teams would work on this single, interactive system and therefore be able to have almost instant access to the fruits of each other’s labours. Once ESTC has gained experience of using the system, the British Library will experiment with other uses to which RLIN might be put. The link via Washington will also give the Library direct access to the National Library of Medicine.
It is hoped that this development will result in a more complete and coherent ’first edition’ of ESTC, which will be published in 1989. In the meantime, the ESTC file is available to scholars on both BLAISE- LINE and on RLIN.” (Crump 106)

“No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page. Subject areas can be isolated by keyword and the search can be further refined by place or country of publication. The output of a particular printer can be readily retrieved and then charted in terms of numbers per decade or per year. However, the most exciting quality of having the file mounted on the national database is the way in which it becomes of use, not only for searches such as these, but also for people working in disciplines that might not previously have resorted to the printed short title catalogues for the earlier periods. Furthermore, the searches outlined above presuppose large bodies of material, but the file can be used just as easily to verify a hunch in which a zero result would be a significant finding. A simplified manual for searching the file on-line has been prepared and is available free of charge from the editorial office.” (Crump 106)</Text>

            <Text>The second phase of the project takes up persons and networks. As in the first phase of the project, it is a substantial undertaking simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project consults this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of printed texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. </Text>

            <Text>Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical--or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream”--printing circles. My network graphs model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a set of concrete and stable ideological stances. This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and authors. I consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, and correspondence societies. This then enables me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, in context with the print production which they are alternatives to. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me with two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices with the horizon of expectations within the radical circles I expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three, where they may in fact be marginalized. Together, these approaches further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.</Text>

Memoralizing, too, is cyclical: “And now, where Caesar saw with proud disdain / The wattled hut and skin of azure stain, / Corinthian columns rear their graceful forms, / And light varandas brave the wintry storms, / While British tongues the fading fame prolong / Of Tully's eloquence and Maro's song.”

Perhaps, she says, long ages past away, 
And set in western waves our closing day, {120} 
Night, Gothic night, again may shade the plains 
Where Power is seated, and where Science reigns; 
England, the seat of arts, be only known 
By the gray ruin and the mouldering stone; 
That Time may tear the garland from her brow, {125} 
And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now. 
   Yet then the ingenuous youth whom Fancy fires 
With pictured glories of illustrious sires, 
With duteous zeal their pilgrimage shall take 
From the blue mountains, or Ontario's lake, {130} 
With fond adoring steps to press the sod 
By statesmen, sages, poets, heroes trod

…

  But who their mingled feelings shall pursue 
When London's faded glories rise to view? 
The mighty city, which by every road, 
In floods of people poured itself abroad; {160} 
Ungirt by walls, irregularly great, 
No jealous drawbridge, and no closing gate; 
Whose merchants (such the state which commerce brings) 
Sent forth their mandates to dependant kings; 
Streets, where the turban'd Moslem, bearded Jew, {165} 
And woolly Afric, met the brown Hindu; 
Where through each vein spontaneous plenty flowed, 
Where Wealth enjoyed, and Charity bestowed. 
Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet 
Each splendid square, and still, untrodden street; {170} 
Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time, 
The broken stair with perilous step shall climb, 
Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round, 
By scattered hamlets trace its antient bound, 
And, choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey {175} 
Through reeds and sedge pursue his idle way. 
  With throbbing bosoms shall the wanderers tread 
The hallowed mansions of the silent dead, 
Shall enter the long isle and vaulted dome 
Where Genius and where Valour find a home; {180} 
Awe-struck, midst chill sepulchral marbles breathe, 
Where all above is still, as all beneath; 
Bend at each antique shrine, and frequent turn 
To clasp with fond delight some sculptured urn, 
The ponderous mass of Johnson's form to greet, {185} 
Or breathe the prayer at Howard's sainted feet. 

…

Oft shall the strangers turn their eager feet {205} 
The rich remains of antient art to greet, 
The pictured walls with critic eye explore, 
And Reynolds be what Raphael was before. 
On spoils from every clime their eyes shall gaze, 
Egyptian granites and the Etruscan vase; {210} 
And when midst fallen London, they survey 
The stone where Alexander's ashes lay, 
Shall own with humbled pride the lesson just

            <Text>Hannah More – poet, playwright, essayist, and tract writer – was destined to teach. From the precocious student of Latin and mathematics in Stapleton and the junior teacher at her sisters’ Park Street school in Bristol to the lionized Evangelical reformer identified with Abolitionist and anti-Jacobin causes, she became recognized as ‘the most influential female philanthropist of her day’1 and one of its most financially successful women writers. Success and service went hand in hand: her will bequeathed ‘the very substantial sum of £27,500’ with most of the money directed ‘to about 200 selected charities’.2 Innate gifts and social conditions worked in tandem to shape and speed her career; she rose to prominence at a time particularly conducive to her talents and national loyalties, both of which were rooted in her confessional identity and deep commitment to political stability. More’s renown coincided with the end of the Republic of Letters, an imagined, international, travelling scholarly congregation where discourse was often cross-gendered and multilingual and where, ironically, she would have felt at home. How- ever, as Peter Burke explicates with his analyses of the geographies of know- ledge in the late eighteenth century, there are two reasons for the end of this community of letters: ‘specialization and nationalism’,3 involving the rise of a sense of identity defined against other disciplines and other nations. Such a shift from cosmopolitanism to nationalism signalled the closing of this kind of intellectual free trade and harmony. Specialization would likely have been less attractive to such a voracious, endlessly curious reader as More; how- ever, the appeal of national and religiously inspired pride, especially in light of her opposition to revolution on the Continent, was ready-made. (Demers 106)
In current scholarly discourse, the prominence of religion in a novel ostensibly concerned with the choice of ‘a suitably moral partner’15 can be / discomfiting and perplexing. More’s close-to-perfect fictional figures lead Mark Canuel to comment on the absence of any ‘discernible characters’.16 Yet commentary also directs attention to the novel’s political and ideological resonance and its bold, at times dialogic, engagement with Evangelicalism. Andrew Heisel is forced to acknowledge More’s ‘narrowed’ characters, who ‘almost in spite of themselves and their readers convey vital moral truth’.17 Lisa Wood reads the novel as ‘a manual for maximizing the religious and antirevolutionary potential of the domestic circle’ with the narrator representing ‘an Evangelical form of domestic masculinity’.18 While Anne Stott positions the rational and humane education which the novel promotes within the ‘British Christian Enlightenment’,19 Kerry Sinanan goes as far as to label the ‘Evangelical sincerity in Cœlebs ... more radical’, since More’s duty is ‘a strategic means to engage with an imperfectible world’ through characters whose ‘striving to act out of a moral sense is active’.20 Focusing on the role of conversation in this novel, Jon Mee credits More with a willingness to ‘countenance “collision” in conversation when it comes in the defense of the truth of Christian values’.21 But only in a few instances do such collisions effect real change or injury and result in repair or reform. (107-8)
”Writing for More is primarily a mode of instruction, whether in poetry, drama, essay, or tract, conveying either a female or a male voice of authority.” (Demers 109)</Text>

            <Title>Bainbridge is wrong about print culture &amp; reprinting</Title>
            <Text>Bainbridge frequently discusses strategies of print publication as part of his analysis: a particularly insightful footnote discusses, for example, a poem which circulated both as an ode in a magazine and as lyrics in a broadsheet. Bainbridge observes that “texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration” (10). However, his explanations of individual print strategies are often hindered by his approach to literature’s cultural capital. At one point, for example, he argues that “the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott” (53). I contend that the republication of substantially older works of literature is not a sign that England was destitute of true poetry before Walter Scott, but rather an attempt to solve the challenges to national identity posed by the 1790s’ disruption of history.</Text>

What is the print landscape of the 1790s actually like? As opposed to our filtered versions via academics, subsequent generations of writers
TL Cowan etc - how do you actually do recuperative/reparative work on archives
Looking at digital corpora the way that people look at anthologies, classroom teaching, etc; talk about why it’s important to know this, becase this is what we all refer to now
Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)
Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. (But stay away from seeing Romanticism as starting here; I’d have to do a lot of work to justify to scholars the beginning of Romanticism in the 1790s)
Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about celebrity and reprinting into this chapter)
Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft &amp; Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strageically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?
A lot of my questions aren’t quite about canons, they’re about ARCHIVES, which are related but without the idea of cultural capital; do our archives just reflect our canons? — Marisett - how the dewey decimal system systematically excludes african american authors of the 20thC — data production (of course it’s really all capta — the things you choose, and also the things that are made available for capture; shaped by choices and by constraints)
Is it even possible to get back to that initial moment before the archive formation began? I’m going to try! Undoing the misperception of what we begin with “before” the archive, and the perception of what is produced by DH

Who was actually printing what? Booksellers and print culture from a DH angle

Gothic: synthesize popular and political? Radical novels are often Gothic; but Gothic is also highly popular/mainstream. Not just a simple fusion of mass and racial media, but something there? Gothic as a mode or material that people want to have an inherent political content, but in fact it can be used for any agenda, it can be used for various forms… but there’s a lot that can’t be reshaped? Repackages radical themes to be mass accessible (melodrama?)? — Re-read Gary Kelley’s Jacobin Novel; something on melodrama

TITLE:  (1790s English) Print Politics in the Digital Archive

Map of the thesis at this stage:
	1.	Introduction: archive formation!
	2.	Comparison of digital corpora (write this first)
	3.	Ok, now how can I use these corpora to ask again what the print landscape of the 1790s actually looked like?
	⁃	Mainstream press?
	⁃	Radical press? Is it actually surreptitious/marginal?
[Something something the Gothic? (Will develop as the earlier parts develop) — but don’t put this in the proposal set]
TODO: Slot all the bits that I don’t want to lose into this new structure

Ongoing warning: I’m not trying to talk to undergrads, so I don’t need to debunk undergrad misperceptions. Read more secondary literature. Email Terry for books more often!

Mention that I am writing my own code, and that I think it’s crucial to read code and critique its algorithmic assumptions. Very explicit about methods. 2015 NSF report on reproducibility of research. My methods have to be able to explain how they are trustworthy.
(Put datasets in open access — T-space? Cultural Analytics?)
(Can generate a lot of words on methods section — but don’t bury in appendices? Instead put it in methods sections? 10,000 words, not 40,000 words. Remember that Terry is the audience.)

To read: Alan Liu — read his work on Romantic canonization; try to meet him? Him and the editors of Romantic Circles are the godfathers of DH and Romanticism. Just had one in PMLA about disjunction between DH and literary critics, how we frame questions and results

            <Title>capta</Title>
            <Text>My attention to the sources of digital knowledge creation comes, in part, from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” Drucker, in “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” specifically addresses the digital humanities practice of creating, and then close-reading, data visualizations. She argues that the tools for visual representation which may be effective in the sciences cannot be simply and uncritically transposed to humanistic subject matter. When an experiment is presented as a ‘data visualization,’ she says, “the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework” (8). In fields where the readers of such charts are also frequent creators of charts, and where norms exist to explicitly describe one’s interpretive frameworks in a methodology section, the simplicity and legibility of an individual chart may be a benefit which does not impede complex scrutiny of the information it presents. In a field like literature, however, the “graphical force” of something like a network graph or even a simple pie chart “conceals what the statistician knows very well — that no ‘data’ preexist their parameterization” (8). Drucker problematizes the term “data,” the etymology of which presents it as a “given” which is stable and independent of observation. She proposes that humanities visualizations embrace, instead, the framework of “capta,” that which is “‘taken’ actively” (3), “fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena” (50). Drucker’s assessment shapes my own prioritization of qualitative and reflective computational research. The term “capta” itself has not seen uptake in subsequent digital humanities scholarship, even in cases where scholars explicitly take Drucker’s warnings to heart. Accordingly, for clarity, this dissertation will continue to use the more usual term “data” to refer to the information gathered for analysis here. However, as I integrate and compare a wide variety of data from many disparate sources, a preliminary task of my analysis is always to determine, as precisely as possible, how the information was captured and quantified. </Text>
            <Comments>It may also be the case, of course, that even fields with a long history of graphical display would benefit from greater scrutiny of the evidence they use; see: the Data Dinosaur. But this is beyond the remit of what an English PhD can address.</Comments>

            <Text>KEY CONCLUSIONS
	•	“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
	•	“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)
	⁃	“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education … as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (329-330)
	•	“The most politically strategic argument for revising the canon remains the argument that the works so revalued are important and valuable cultural works. If literary critics are not yet in a position to recognize the inevitability of the social practice of judgment, that is a measure of how far the critique of the canon still is from developing a sociology of judgment. The theory of cultural capital elaborated in this book is an attempt to construct just such a sociology.” (Xiv)
	•	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming." (340)
	•	“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)
	•	“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)


Preface
	•	“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The "means" in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)
	⁃	“The literary syllabus is the institutional form by means of which this knowledge is disseminated, and it constitutes capital in two senses: First, it is linguistic capital, the means by which one attains to a socially credentialed and therefore valued speech” (ix)
	⁃	“And second, it is symbolic capital, a kind of knowledge-capital whose possession can be displayed upon request and which thereby entitles its possessor to the cultural and material rewards of the well-educated person.” (Ix)
	•	“I will argue that evaluative judgments are the necessary but not sufficient condition for the process of canon formation, and that it is only by understanding the social function and institutional protocols of the school that we will understand how works are preserved, reproduced, and disseminated over successive generations and centuries. Similarly, where the debate speaks about the canon as representing or failing to represent particular social groups, I will speak of the school's historical function of distributing, or regulating access to, the forms of cultural capital.” (Vii)
	•	“The theory of cultural capital implies that the proper social context for analyzing the school and its literary curriculum is class.” (Viii)
	•	“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)

Chapter 1
	•	Establishes the flaws in the current canon debate:
	⁃	A focus on “representation” as if literary representation was equivalent to political representation
	⁃	Essentialist assumptions of liberal pluralism
	⁃	“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
	⁃	The “exclusion” hypothesis
	⁃	“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon.” (16)
	•	The “decline of the humanities” is the reduction of literature’s cultural capital
	⁃	“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)
	⁃	university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
	•	The actual function of the canon: "The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
	⁃	the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
	⁃	revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
	⁃	revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)
	⁃	"An individual's judgment that a work is great does nothing in itself to preserve that work, unless that judgment is made in a certain institutional context, a setting in which it is possible to insure the reproduction of the work, its continual reintroduction to generations of readers.” (28)
	•	How to ‘open’ the canon:
	⁃	Must necessarily modernize it
	⁃	Present “minority works” as valuable literary history, not “representation” or subversion
	⁃	“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works [by minorities] because they are important and significant cultural works. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
	⁃	But really, the goal is to address unequal access to cultural capital

Chapter 2
	•	“The context of the first case study is the institution of a vernacular literary curriculum in the primary schools of the eighteenth century.” (X)
	⁃	"The fact of increased upward mobility is at once the premise of ‘bourgeois ideology' -- that anyone can succeed -- and its prime source of social anxiety. … there must be neither too little nor too much social mobility.” (95)
	⁃	“since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless’ knowledge comes to stand… as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent." (96-97) "This ambivalence... is ultimately resolved with the entry of vernacular literature into the new, middle-class schools. The study of vernacular literature is thus at first a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97)
	•	18thC: Serious vs popular is the new high vs low
	⁃	Previously, poetry was high and prose was low. If some prose has cultural capital now, how can we avoid having ALL prose be high literature? Make the distinction somewhere other than its basic form
	⁃	“the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel. Wordsworth and Coleridge responded to this crisis with a programmatic attempt to reaffirm the High Cultural status of traditional canonical works in English against, on the one hand, popular novels and narrative poetry, and, on the other, the quasi-Latinate "poetic diction" supposed to have characterized especially the work of Gray. The effect of that program, which was of course shared by a literary culture much larger than the circle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was to reserve the term "literature" for High Canonical works, and in this way to maintain the cultural capital of those works.”” (Xi)
	•	what now distinguishes "serious" literature from “popular" literature is its penetration into the school system: reserving a work until higher in the school hierarchy is what grants it higher status (133)
	⁃	the school "as the site at which social mobility is choked off" (95) -- the poor should be actively deprived of education in order to minimize too much mobility
Chapter 3
	•	“I have constructed the second case study around a moment in which the vernacular curriculum in the university became strongly distinguished from the curriculum in the primary and secondary levels. This was the moment of the great canonical reformation of the New Critics.” (Xi)
	•	Leavis and New Critics both want literature to create a ‘literary sensibility’ in people, as the new ‘doxa’
	⁃	even though Leavis and New Critics had different ideological values, they could agree on canon reassessment because "the two movements could be seen to provide different solutions to the same social or cultural problems.” (135)
	⁃	“literature itself can be installed as a sensibility that performs the social function of doxa— producing a state of cultural homogeneity, or unquestioned belief-- without ever requiring the 'imperfect' supplement of orthodoxy, without specifying directly what these beliefs are. Precisely because sensibility is not the same thing as belief, it is never subject to decay into mere orthodoxy." (138)
	•	However, literature actually became less important, relegated to schools
	⁃	“The school becomes the site at which the practice of reading can be cultivated in such a way as to preserve the cultural capital of literature (signified in the Brooksian allegory as a kind of sacredness), just because its social space can be conceived as a space of deliberate and strategic withdrawal, as the withdrawal of literary culture from 'the world’” (165)
	⁃	This involved a new positive valuation of “difficulty,” as the marker of real literature
	⁃	“In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, these new students also discovered at the same moment why it needed to be studied in the university” (172)
	⁃	“Literature... presents a united front, in the form of its intrinsic difficulty, against the artifacts of mass culture” (173)
	•	Literature retained its high reputation even as it lost relevance
	⁃	“Therein lies the peculiar power of mass culture, since the waning cultural centrality of literary works in the face of new mass cultural forms never entailed a denial of the nominally superior value of literature” -- readers of mass media “would no doubt have concede the cultural superiority of literature, whether or not [they] ever felt inclined to read any works so designated" (173)
	⁃	“the mass culture of modernity never coveted the institutional space to which literary culture retreated" -- uni students dutifully studied &amp; accepted the value of literature but “continued to consume both kinds of artifacts in the distinct spheres of their consumption" (174)
	⁃	“The capacity to experience the social space of the schools and the social space of mass culture as disjunct effectively institutionalized two modes of consumption, one consequence of which was to make literary works more difficult to consume outside the school." (174)
	⁃	“The effect of New Critical pedagogy was rather to produce a kind of recusant literary culture, at once faithful to the quasi-sacred authority of literature but paying tribute at the same time to the secular authority of a derogated mass culture. For the recusants the artifact of mass culture might be consumed with a certain guilt, or a certain relief; but for those whose allegiance was sworn to secular authority, that culture provided everything there was to consume." (175)
Chapter 4
	•	There has also been a canon reformation in grad school, with the new syllabus of ‘theory’
	⁃	“Chapter 4 turns to the highest level of the educational system, the graduate school, where in the last twenty-five years the literary syllabus has been supplemented by a list of texts which effectively circulate as a "canon of theory."” (Xii)
	⁃	“The names which circulate as ‘theory' in this canonical sense are actually very few in number, much more restricted a list than that which constitutes ‘canonical' literary work. Furthermore the very canonical organization of these texts, their recategorization as 'theory', has the effect of neutralizing the generic, disciplinary, and ideological differences between them in much the same way that the literary canon tends to define all canonical literary texts as the embodiment of a single quality of 'literariness’.” (203)
	⁃		“what unifies the syllabus which includes (among others) Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, or Nietzche, Freud, Saussure, and Heidegger, is the fact that these oeuvres can be taken to embody a discourse of mastery, which is always by definition an imitable discourse." (203)
	⁃	theory introduces to grad pedagogy "a syllabus whose symptomatic function is to signify precisely methodological 'rigor,' rather than the taste or discrimination which for so long determined the ideological protocols of literary criticism.” (260)
	•	Theory is a response to the irrelevance of literature
	⁃	schools used to be tasked with "the impossible task of at once democratizing the distribution of knowledges and maintaining class distinctions" but now "the nation-state…no longer requires that a distinctive practice of … language identify a culturally homogenous bourgeoisie. That class has long since been replaced by a culturally heterogenous New Class” (263)
	⁃	“the hegemony of that technobureaucratic organization of intellectual life which has rendered the literary curriculum socially marginal by transforming the university into the institution designed to produce a new class of technical/managerial specialists possessed of purely technical/managerial knowledge." (261)
	⁃	“the reconstruction of criticism as a ‘technical' practice revealed the intrinsic inadequacy of the literary syllabus as the object of that intellectual labor; hence the ‘rigor' of theory had to be embodied not in literary works but in the philosophical or other nonliterary texts supplementing that syllabus. It is these works, the 'canon of theory,' which signify rigor." (181)
	⁃	“The increasingly technobureaucratic organization of the professional field of literary criticism was a condition for the emergence of theory, which we can understand in retrospect as the reassertion of charismatic authority in the face of that technobureaucratic domination." (256)
	⁃	He has a lot to say about ‘transference’ in the pedagogy of Lacan and de Man. “Lacan and de Man appear to set off resolutely on opposite theoretical directions, but ... they end up in the same place, the place of the ‘the subject who is supposed to know.’” (195)
	•	“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)

Chapter 5
	•	The history of “aesthetic value” as a concept, as it emerged in 18thC ‘moral philosopgy’ debates on aesthetics and economics
	⁃	"the practice of judging works of art need make no reference at all to the concept of value before the emergence of political economy… the comparison of authors or works to one another need not at that time be expressed as the comparison of their relative 'aesthetic values,' because neither the concept of the aesthetic, nor the concept of value, are as yet defined in such a way that they can be yoked together.” (303)
	⁃	“the market is the historical /condition/ and not merely the proper analogy for the extension of the value-concept to all acts of judgment." (324)
	•	“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
	⁃	“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education” (329-330)
	⁃	"as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (330)
	⁃	"To say that the aesthetic disposition determines the relative cultural capital granted to any particular work is to say that the act of judgment is the assignment, or even the recognition, of cultural capital. Judgment is the act by which the aesthetic disposition expresses or externalizes itself, according to criteria which are relatively internalized, that is, neither capable of being fully rationalized, nor materially caused in the manner of a biological predisposition.” (332)
	•	Actual aesthetics (as distinct from ‘aesthetic value’) are, necessarily, everywhere
	⁃	“the largest effect of the discourse of canonicity: the illusion that aesthetic experience is really restricted to the experience of High Cultural works." (336)
	⁃	“As Michael Denning has recently reminded us, there are innumerable examples in working-class cultural forms of formal experiment and variation; it is precisely the experience of formal innovation which engages interest and admiration in these consumers, even though such manifestly aesthetic experience... may fail to be recognized as aesthetic.” (336)
	⁃	"The recognition of cultural capital, otherwise known as aesthetic judgment, must deny, as a condition of its exercise, the ubiquity of aesthetic experience, the fact that such experience utterly pervades the field of cultural production." (336)
	•	We must actually reform access.
	⁃	Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
	⁃	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)
	•	Then, works will still compete, but differently.
	⁃	“The idea of production for the producers (which by definition entails /consumption/ by the producers) projects onto a utopian screen the disarticulation of cultural capital from the system of class formation, and thus from ‘distinction' based on inequality of access to cultural goods. Bourdieu calls this condition 'total autonomy from the laws of the market.' Such a condition does not, however, prophesy the disappearance of cultural capital. The universalization of restricted production would rather transform cultural capital into pure 'symbolic distinction.’” (339)
	⁃	“Even were such an educational system no longer to regulate access to cultural capital in the grotesquely unequal way it presently does, cultural producers would still compete to have their products read, studied, looked at, heard, lived in, sung, worn, and would still accumulate cultural capital in the form of 'prestige’ or fame. But social distinctions reinstated on such an aesthetic basis would have to be expressed in social relations as distinctions in ‘lifestyle,' in other words a vast enlargement of the field of aesthetic judgment." (339)
	⁃	“What we call canon formation would then become a much larger part of social life, because not restricted to the institutions of the materially advantaged.” (339)

            <Text>A central tension for me is the sense that Hannah More and William Wordsworth are both falling into similar traps of aestheticizing and moralizing their disdain for the very real distress for those in poverty, and that I nonetheless find Shepherd of Salisbury Plain more palatable than Michael. Michael in its beauties disguises its operations; More is so transparent that it’s easy to simply set aside what is unpalatable and read for the other details.

            <Title>"good" and "bad" texts</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.</Text>

The ancien re ́gime and its critics 
was partly because the event resembled less a domestic rebellion than an invasion by a foreign prince, and crucially because of the need to placate the Tories who were inured to the doctrine of ‘passive obedience and non- resistance’ and to abhorrence of the ‘king-killing doctrines’ they associated with puritans and Jesuits. The need to assuage the troubled consciences of conservatives ensured that the Allegiance Controversy became chiefly an exercise in casuistry: the resolving of conscientious scruples by the applica- tion of general moral principles to equivocal practical contingencies. The matter was made pressing by the imposition of a new oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary, demanded of those who had previously solemnly sworn fealty to James II. Once again, an earlier debate was invoked, that surrounding the Engagement Controversy of 1649, when people had been required to swear allegiance to the English republic in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I. Anthony Ascham’s Of the Confusions and Rev- olutions of Government (1649) was republished, advising stoical acquiescence to power and the dispositions of divine providence.

            <Title>Joseph Ritson's Robin Hood</Title>
            <Text>Me: @jesslockhart, the thing about my dissertation is this person Joseph Ritson whom I have INEXPLICABLY never heard of despite reading a bunch of books about 18thC ballads, Jacobin politics in poetry, etc etc etc. He seems like a REALLY interesting guy, RIGHT in my decade, and possibly a good candidate for some recovery work
Me: looks like ECCO doesn’t have his 1795 Robin Hood! 1789-99, all I have attributed to him are 3 critiques of somebody’s edition of Shakespeare, 1 critique of History of English Poetry, and 1 work titled “law-tracts”.
Cai: He's the guy who wrote The Robin Hood Collection, and he added the "give to the poor" bit because he was a Jacobin
Me: ESTC has 1 volume of shakespeare criticism and 4 of legal stuff attributed to him
Cai: Robin Hood before this shows up in lots of places as a stock character or in this story or another, but Joseph Ritson is apparently the guy who, having put almost all the circulating Robin tales into one volume, hands down to future writers/readers The Robin Hood and also a set of "outlaw stock tropes"
so if you're writing Outlaw Tales after 1795, you're indebted to Ritson (so we have found according to wikipedia anyway)

lawrence [9:33 PM]
31 ESTC titles mention Robin Hood, many unattributed, so Ritson must be hiding in there (edited)

cemhend [9:33 PM]
I wonder if he didn't credit himself as author but as compiler so that keeps him out of those dbs @lawrence? not sure how they work

lawrence [9:34 PM]
the specific MARC label I checked generally includes identified-by-scholarship relevant “persons” (as opposed to necessarily the author credited)
but if nobody bothered to go and encode that he’s the unsigned author it’s easy for him to get left out

jesslockhart [8:23 PM]
“In nearly all the small points with which he dealt, Ritson was in the right, and his corrections have since been adopted, but the unjustly bitter language of his criticisms roused great anger at the time, much, it would appear, to Ritson’s delight.”
Wiki indicates that Joseph Ritson was a shit disturber

            <Text>More’s biography differs strongly from Smith’s and Robinson’s in that she never married. Instead, much of More’s personal life centred around educational ventures. In 1758, when More was thirteen, her eldest sister Mary More opened a girls’ boarding school, which Hannah More would soon assist in running. In 1762, this school moved to larger premises. In 1767, More accepted a proposal of marriage from William Turner, though this did not end in marriage: “After a rather humiliating six-year courtship (during which the pending marriage was postponed three times by the gentleman), a settlement was reached on behalf of More by her family, resulting in an annuity that granted her enough financial independence to embark on a literary career” (Prior). When the engagement was finally broken in 1773, More made her first visit to London, and her life’s focus shifted from education to literature. She moved in literary circles, joined the Bluestockings, and particularly befriended the famous actor David Garrick. However, after Garrick’s death and the failure of her third play, both in 1779, More’s focus shifted again, from London literary life to religious life. Her interest in the growing movement of Evangelicals ultimately brought her to the Clapham Sect, whose foremost cause was the abolition of the slave trade (Prior). She returned to Somerset, buying her own house, Cowslip Green, in 1785, and religion brought her back to education. She and her sister Patty More founded the first of the Mendip Schools at Cheddar, Somerset in 1789. “With the encouragement and support of the Clapham Evangelicals … More undertook opening and operating Sunday Schools … in order to teach the children of the laboring classes to read and write, to learn the catechism, and to lead moral lives informed by Christian teaching. Though the effort was clouded by political and theological controversy from various sides, More eventually opened sixteen schools that taught hundreds of students.” (Prior). In 1790, the More sisters hand over the Park Street school to Selina Mills. In 1792, she founds women’s benefit clubs at Cheddar and Shipham. 1799 marks the beginning of the “Blagdon controversy”: “one of More's teachers is accused of Methodism; the accusation widens into a series of attacks on More for alleged religious and political subversion; as a result she suffers depression and nervous collapse and for a while is unable to write,” until 1802 (Stott). In 1801, More retired— somewhat. She moved to a new home, Barley Wood, outside the village of Wrington, where she maintained a voluminous correspondence and continued to receive and advise many visitors (Prior). In 1813 she founded an auxiliary Bible Society at Wrington. “She continued to support generously efforts at poverty-relief until her death. More died September 7, 1833, having survived all of her sisters and most of the members of her London circle of friends” (Prior).</Text>

            <Title>homophily</Title>
            <Text>Wendy Chun suggests that the problem with much algorithmic inquiry lies in its most core assumption: the insistence that the future must look like the past \cite{Chun:2018tq}. This assumption is essential to any system which exclusively bases its predictions on past data. It is particularly intertwined with what Chun calls “homophily,” “the axiom that similarity breeds connection—which grounds contemporary network science” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.60}. Homophily, as it is currently applied to network science, Chun argues, both “assumes and creates segregation” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.76} in a fashion that allows it to operate “like money laundering for bias” \cite{Chun:2018tq pp.62-63}. Importantly, however, the analogy to money laundering is imperfect: it cannot be resolved with “better, cleaner data” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.64}. Instead, Chun insists, “new theories of connection—which do not presume a dangerously banal and reciprocal notion of friendship—are needed” \cite{Chun:2018tq p.89}, a call to action which places its emphasis not on the information provided to an algorithm but on the algorithm’s procedures.</Text>

“Kirwan praises Ward Elliot and Robert Valenza’s “call for acknowledgement of uncertainty (a productive agnosticism rather than a reactionary atheism or unquestioning faith),” concluding the section with the dictum that “critics should be as willing to lose Shakespeare as to find him””
“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””
“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha. In so doing, Kirwan proposes to continue destabilizing the monolithic “Shakespeare,” a project he traces back two decades.”
“a startlingly diffuse, unexpectedly consistent corpus of plays linked by company ownership, rather than by what he argues is the anachronism of authorial ownership.
Motivated to trouble “post-Romantic ideals of individual authorship””
“Boldly, he offers agnosticism to replace the “did-didn’t binary.” This yields “the possibility of Shakespeare’s contribution” to Locrine (137) or a proposed differentiation between “Shakespearean” and “by Shakespeare” (161). This third chapter may inflame more controversy than anything else in the book.”
“the field of attribution studies desperately needs critical metacognitive appraisals of its methods, its successes, and its failures. Kirwan’s assessment of and engagement with attribution studies ought to be cited for years to come”
“Having proven the constructedness of “Canon” and “Apocrypha,” having demonstrated the viability of collaboratively created drama, and having questioned the use and availability of “certain” attributions, Kirwan performs his crowning disruption—to “redefine the meanings of both ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘complete’ in a bid to offer multiple configurations of canon” (205). Here and throughout, Kirwan affirms canons, not a Canon.”
“Kirwan’s final chapter models alternative canon-writing practices as evidence of the potentiality of multivalent canons “to provide options instead of answers” dependent upon audiences’ critical participation”</Text>

            <Title>STAR</Title>
            <Text>The ESTC is not actually only one database: “The STAR file, maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. … In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC’s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.” (Tabor 373) There are two kinds of information, in particular, which the STAR file contains and which is concealed from ESTC users: the true ‘verified’ status of individual edition matches, and edition-specific notes on known errors.
A “match” in the ESTC is a known copy of a book held in a library which serves as a representative of a particular edition. A match can be encoded as “verified” when an ESTC staff member consults the book to confirm that it corresponds to the edition in question, or “unverified” when this has not happened. But the STAR copy contains two additional verification statuses: when a contributor such as a librarian or a scholar submits a match, it is coded as a “web match.” “Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the ‘verified’ and ‘unverified’ levels” (Tabor 374). Automated uploads of various outside databases can also generate new matches, encoded as “catalogue matches;” these “have a comparatively low level of reliability” (Tabor 374). However, in the transition from STAR to ESTC, “The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to ‘verified’. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt” (374).

            <Title>fruitful models</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation understands archives, bibliographies, anthologies, and corpora to all be, variously, models of an imagined object of study. In the language of social science, these models might be described as ‘samples,’ which are intended to permit discoveries about an underlying ‘population’ by being ‘representative’ of that population’s features. Only the language and not the methods of social science need to be imported here, since it has long been ordinary practice in literary studies to select and examine representative texts for insights about larger movements. A work like Ann Tracy’s bibliography The Gothic Novel 1790-1830, for example, clearly names the population of works which are of interest to her: all Gothic novels published between 1790 and 1830. But in providing detailed information on 208 texts — mostly Gothic, mostly novels, mostly between 1790 and 1830 — Tracy obviously does not claim to have presented all that might belong within this population. Instead, her book operates as a model of the underlying population, which can be queried for further insight into ‘the Gothic novel, 1790-1830’ only so long as one keeps the limits of the model in mind. Indeed, by presenting plot summaries and bibliographic data, rather than reproducing the novels in full, Tracy provides a model of a model. Importantly, a model is a tool for thinking, and not necessarily a truth-claim in itself: creating a model is a way of saying, ‘it might be helpful to think of X as Y,’ not an assertion that X is equivalent to Y. Willard McCarty articulates this important feature of models by stressing that a model’s value is determined not by its exact correspondence with the object it models — if it were possible to fully examine the underlying object, then no model would be necessary — but by the fruitfulness of its simplifications. Even a deeply incorrect model can be fruitful if its divergence from observed phenomena rules out an incorrect theory. As I examine the many existing models of ‘English literature, 1789-1799,’ and create several more of my own, I articulate the underlying assumptions of each model, and assess the fruitfulness of the results.</Text>

            <Text>(1a) I am excited about the ways that distant reading allows the consideration of more works, and thus an expansion of the works under discussion.  I’ll probably make a database trying to combine all the stuff I have, and definitely make a lot of artisanal hand-crafted “small data.
(1b) I am also excited about the recursive reflective process of modelling: the usefulness of making one’s models and their parameters explicit and testing multiple models; the need to actually meaningfully *account for* the full variety of what one is working with, to grapple with and reconcile outliers.”
My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline.
Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all” (McCarty). These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.
“The range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation.” … “Between these two is what seems to me the ideal – a combination, not compromise, of centrifugal freedom and centripetal beholdenness.” (McCarty) 
“digital humanities offers a middle ground or conjectural space within which, data being simply data, the objects of study dear to the humanities may be treated temporarily as if they were objects of nature, like rocks or stars, then the results of that treatment juxtaposed to how we see them and questions asked.” (McCarty)</Text>

            <Title>felski, surface readers</Title>
            <Text>I have mentioned moving away from critique as well as from paranoia: in rethinking the role of critique, I draw upon the work of Rita Felski, and the theories of “surface reading” described by Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, and Heather Love. Felski, in her article “After Suspicion” and then further in her monograph The Limits of Critique, seeks to attend seriously to literary attachments, including our own attachments as critics. Felski’s approach to these attachments is essentially sociological, drawing heavily on Bruno Latour’s actor-network-theory, and thus involves almost no close reading. “Surface reading” positions itself as an alternative to “symptomatic reading”; rather than seeking to expose hidden truths concealed within texts, it attempts accurate descriptions that “make visible what is invisible only because it's too much on the surface of things” (Best 13). The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but not perfect: all paranoid reading is symptomatic, but not all symptomatic reading is paranoid. Reparative reading, as described by Sedgwick, is often still interested in ‘deep’ meanings of texts, in which striking textual features can be interpreted to locate additional meanings. Felski’s readings are often symptomatic in this way. In contrast, “surface reading,” as Heather Love describes, pursues “a turn away from the singularity and richness of individual texts” (374), seeking descriptions that are “complex and variegated, but not rich, warm, or deep” (378). Love’s disavowal of “richness” here is part of her attempt to move away from “the ethical charisma of the literary translator or messenger” (374) who characterizes the paranoid, critical figure that both Sedgwick and Felski also seek to escape.</Text>

            <Title>account for variety with information density</Title>
            <Text>Minard is actually making a strong and brutal argument in his chart -- against war, against Napoleon, and against history as the biography of celebrity. I need to do a lot of actual research first, to figure out what I think is true, and why I think it, but I will know that I have succeeded, I think, if I can produce something half so rich and persuasive.

Right now this means that I am throwing out my current dissertation outline, which separates things based on which corpus I am pulling my information from. I will describe my methods in the most voluminous appendices the department has ever seen if I must (and I strongly suspect that, in the end, I must) but I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.

I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.</Text>

            <Title>big picture</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation is concerned with the process by which texts do or don’t ‘enter’ into ‘canons’ of writings, particularly in [the context of digital resources which present themselves as alternatives to canons]. My ‘case study’ is the writing published in England between 1789 and 1799, [A PERIOD THAT IS RELEVANT TO MY QUESTION]. I say “writing” and not “literature,” despite the fact that my central interest is literature, because I address works whose status as “literary” is contested. I also say “published” rather than “written,” because I address the “1790s-ness” of works written well before this decade, but which took on new and timely meanings when reprinted.
The other “great unread” that even distant reading doesn’t read: the things that aren’t in corpora.

In service of this goal, this dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like. It also seeks to explain, in equally minute detail, why this task of ‘objective’ historical recovery is, in fact, impossible. In the process, I show how our persistently perplexing questions about canons can be asked, and answered, in new ways with digital tools. Computational methods, in their close association with ‘big data’, are often advertised as the solution to the problems of scale which are presumed to motivate the formation of selective canons. As my own computational experimentation will reveal, however, computational study more commonly undertakes the same judgment and valuation of texts that characterizes ‘canon formation,’ and displaces this process onto ‘corpus building.’ It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia. Accordingly, this dissertation takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the major computational experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.</Text>
            <Comments>okay we'll need to theorize this but basically I like it
I would perhaps instead say something like - the challenges inherent, and prob insurmountable, in the task of 'objective historical recovery'
needs clarification

            <Title>closeness / interest</Title>
            <Text>Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistance. Felski describes this as “a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance -- a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments.” As a scholarly practice to demonstrate this closeness, Felski gestures towards what she terms “neophenomenology,” “a sustained attention to the sheer range and complexity of aesthetic experiences, including moments of recognition, enchantment, shock, and knowledge.” Felski has begun this work by establishing a greater richness for the vocabulary of “identifying” with characters. Determining whether a character is “relatable” enough to “identify with” is often a key concern for undergraduate readers and for 18thC thinkers: Felski distinguishes literary itentification into at least three types, “structural or formal alignment, moral allegiance, and emotional empathy,” which could be useful for untangling the allegiance required of different works of sentimental literature. Felski thus begins to locate “post-critical, rather than uncritical” forms of “serious thinking” which could both shed light on and be modified by eighteenth-century practices.</Text>

            <Text>Abstract
The posthumously published Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson (1801) has been read as a final – but flawed – attempt to defend the conduct and rescue the reputation of the notorious actress, poet, and one-time royal mistress, Mary Darby Robinson (1758–1800). Narrating her life as a pathetic tale of transgression and suffering, the Memoirs seems destabilised by inconsistencies in structure and gaps in content which are often discussed by modern critics as shortcomings: evidence of self-censorship, ‘confused’ intentions, or an inability to fashion an acceptable feminine persona. However, these so-called shortcomings may comprise a nuanced strategy of self-presentation designed to evoke curiosity and sympathy. Robinson's Memoirs was reprinted throughout the nineteenth century, spurring numerous novels, mini-biographies, and periodical articles. By examining nineteenth-century responses to the Memoirs, this essay argues for Robinson's life writing as innovative and influential, and gestures to the benefits of extending the traditional ‘edges’ of Romanticism in terms of both genre and period.
Civale, S. (2018) Women’s life writing and reputation: a case study of Mary Darby Robinson. Romanticism, 24 (2). pp. 191-202. ISSN 1354-991X. 
“Robinson spent the bulk of her adult life transforming her public position from sex object to writing subject.” (1+191?)
“despite the continuing doubts about its reliability, Robinson’s Memoirs enjoyed a robust afterlife. It was reprinted ten times in the nineteenth century alone, spurring reviews, essays, spin-off novels, illustrations, poems, mini-biographies, entries in multibiographies, and citations in the life writing of other key figures, most notably that of King George IV himself. Long after her poetry and fiction had fallen out of print, Robinson’s Memoirs continued to interest, perplex, and charm readers.” (3+191?)
“The anonymous novel, The Royal Legend: A Tale (1808), one of several nineteenth-century fictionalisations of Robinson’s royal affair, shows how some of these opposing qualities were read and replayed.” (10+191?)
“Considerations of Robinson in non-fiction also exhibit traces of her Memoirs. In particular, many of the nineteenth-century biographical essays on Robinson relish the coexistence of the unfortunate victim of sensibility and the accomplished woman of the stage. Dutton Cook titles his 1865 mini-biography of Robinson ‘Poor Perdita’, immediately calling to mind her status as a figure of pathos and misfortune.” (13+191?)
“A similar interest in analysing Robinson’s psychology and dramatizing her life also emerges in Elizabeth Barrington’s The Exquisite Perdita, a story which was serialised, with illustrations, in Nash’s and Pall Mall Magazine 1925-26, and reissued in book form in London in 1926.” (15+191?)
“Still, the prevailing critical opinion is that Robinson’s Memoirs ultimately failed to restore her reputation. Cheryl Wanko maintains that Robinson ‘could only salvage [her character] so much’ and Laura Engel, that her ‘attempts to rescue her damaged reputation were thwarted’.37 These claims are true in the sense that Robinson could not erase her scandalous history or escape the public knowledge of her sexual transgression(s), in her lifetime or after. Nevertheless, the nineteenth-century texts considered in this essay indicate some of the ways that Robinson’s Memoirs influenced the texture of her afterlife. Perhaps a reputation is not something merely to be ‘damaged’ or ‘salvaged’, but something to be shaped. Women have long been appraised according to what Katharine Kittredge calls ‘the good woman/bad woman dichotomy’, and yet one of Robinson’s most troubling and appealing features is that she embodies both of these binaries.38 She tells us what she is not telling us, and she visually highlights what she conceals.” (18+191?)

            <Title>popularity</Title>
            <Text>“It may be that Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads affiliates his own verse with the oral tradition of popular ballads that might seem the best recourse for a poet dedicated to the ‘principle of equality’, but it would be hard to claim that Wordsworth’s poems show a knowledge of that tradition equal to Walter Scott’s, nor that they were so deeply influenced by it, nor that they succeeded in addressing so wide an audience, and no one would claim either that Scott’s Muse was a levelling one, or that Scott developed a poetic style, whatever the claims Lukacs has made for the novels, that expressed the principles of the French Revolution.” (16) 

“The first period is characterized by the attempt to frame a universal language, a language in which it might be possible to address all of humanity. The most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status was the language of science, and hence it is appropriate that the most celebrated poet of these years, Erasmus Darwin, was concerned ‘to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science’. (16)

“Erasmus Darwin was the most popular poet of the 1790s, and his The Botanic Garden (1791), in which The Economy of Vegetation formed the first part, and The Loves of Plants (1789) the second, was the decade’s most popular poem.” (29) “The beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden published by Joseph Johnson in 1791, with its elegant typefaces, and its engravings from Fuseli and others, in itself proclaims a confidence in the book’s unusual importance. … His edition of Darwin’s poem registers his recognition of the book’s commercial prospects but also his recognition that the poem gave vivid expression to a set of / beliefs shared by Johnson’s stable of authors, and his confidence that in 1791 such beliefs could be expressed triumphally, by the publication of a volume as costly and elegant as one of Wedgwood’s copies of the Portland Vase, itself reproduced by Blake in the book’s most elaborate engraving.” (29-30)

“Throughout the period treated in this book successive governments made a more sustained and vigorous attempt to prevent the publication of Paine’s writings than those of any other radical propagandist, and the reason is obvious enough. They correctly detected in Tom Paine’s prose the achievement of the alliance between intellectual and popular radicalism that they most feared. Their campaign was strikingly unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent Paine’s works becoming more widely available through cheap reprints than the works of any other contemporary writer, and yet the consequence they feared never came to pass.” (59)
“But it would be idle to deny that it remains for all that an entirely eccentric text. Up to a point Blake’s printing methods in themselves account for this. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell exists in nine complete and two incomplete copies, and it seems improbable that very many more copies were ever produced. The contrast with the thousands of copies circulating of Paine’s Rights of Man needs no underlining. But it would be idle to pretend that the Marriage, even if Blake had devised a way of printing that made possible a wide circulation, would ever have achieved wide popularity, and this was not because Blake as an eccentric, but because his project was.” (60) “in making such an attempt Blake is likely to succeed only in writing the manifesto of a party of which he is the only member” (60)

“Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means — the original two volumes of the Minstrelsy sold for a guinea. James Ballantyne’s printing of the volumes works in tandem with Scott’s editorial work to secure this effect. Typefaces elegantly distinguish the ballads from their editorial matter, and the ballads themselves are displayed with an opulent disregard for economy, no more than eighteen lines to the page, so that the 134 lines of ‘Johnnie Armstrong’ occupy eight pages of the first volume.” (94)</Text>

            <Title>Murphy, Peter</Title>
            <Text>Abstract: “Peter Murphy’s book examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history, or poetry as an art. It focuses on five writers in the Romantic period: James MacPherson, Robert Burns, James Hogg, Walter Scott, and William Wordsworth. The first four are Scottish; the economic and linguistic status of Scotland during the period makes its writers especially interesting as examples of poetic ambition. Murphy’s study then crosses the border into England, offering a new perspective on Wordsworth’s poetic ambition and career. Murphy’s engagement throughout with the ballad revival fields fresh insights into some major concerns of the Romantic period: the interest in the primitive and the simple, experiments with poetic form, the problematics of loss, and the emergence of a new literary culture.” (Page i)

Introduction
“The fact that critics want to talk about Wordsworth more than they do MacPherson is a fact, and in what follows I try to deal with that fact.” (2)
“I try to specify the forces that work to produce the poetry that these writers write, and the forces that cause them to choose poetry writing as a job in the first place.” (3)
“That they choose poetry as a means of escaping into the world of higher life puts poetry in a most material and homely setting. Most of the poetry in these careers has the plainest of material purposes, and much the same status as any other thinga person might make and sell for a hopeful profit. By delineating with particularity the sorts of pressure that result in poetry in these lives, I hope to return poetry to the plain and everyday world of human motive and need, and in this sense this book is deeply historicist.” (3)
Burns couldn’t originally mix among the decorous classes. “Society is ruled by form, and poetry is too… Poetic propriety and ‘social’ propriety mix and become indistinguishable. For the ambitious, a poetic ‘mistake’ has exactly the same consequences as / a social mistake: the threat of failure, rejection by the world that the ambitious writer wishes to enter.” (3-4)
Evaluates people based on how much they exploit the oral northernness they sell - MacPherson the worst, Wordsworth and Scott both have integrity (4-5)
“In what follows I do not wish to recreate the poetic haven that Brooks gives us, but I try to acknowledge at all times that some poets are more capable than others, and that this fact must exert an important evaluation of the place and identity of poetry. To revocalize Brooks in a new key: if it is worth talking about poetry as a distinct form of culture, then we must talk about poetic success and failure. … If poetry as poetry exists in any meaningful form for us, we must find a way to tak about what makes poetry different from other forms of writing: we must talk about the life and energy of poetic form.” (7)

Chapter 1: James MacPherson
“MacPherson was once famous; he has now lapsed, and when we turn to him we must first raise him from oblivion. …quite probably he would not have cared about the lapse of his literary reputation. He died a famous and influential man, and, during much of his life, his primary activities and interests were not literary.” (9)
P. 31 - marketing of Ossian. “MacPherson can compliment Ossian’s poems so extravagantly because he claims to be merely a translator… The money, currency, accrues to MacPherson; the golden intregrity is added to Ossian’s account.” But I don’t see much discussion of how much money or from whom
“MacPherson was one of the greatest of Highland exporters, and the Ossian poems drew more attention to the Highlands than anything else, the rebellion of 1745 excepted” (36) — substantiated by a spike in tourism
“What sort of poetry is this, and what sort of poetic status can we give to James MacPherson? … The controversy and the curiously opaque fraud of the poems work in MacPherson’s favor, since he wants notice above all. He can’t lose: I have tried to show who does lose, but MacPherson cannot. His ambition is fulfilled with ruthless freedom, and as long as he is free he will simply ride the wind of the storm he raises. I would insist that his canonical death is justified, though, because he has committed a literary crime. He is a brilliant but utterly unpoetic poet. His contempt for form is a contempt for / real literary beauty, an the divine emptiness of Ossian’s poems is the result. He is a calculator, a poet for whom poetry is quite simply a possible road to success, and so he happily leaves literature behind… Especially after the reworked inspiration that the high romantic poets give to us, MacPherson’s motives, and what they produce, look appalling. I think we should insist on the ugliness of MacPherson’s poetry, but not on the ugliness of his motives. Such motives have produced more poetry than we often admit. Ambition is a human passion and partakes of human complexity. … Burns’ ambition matches that of MacPherson, and he creates a career for himself  in a very similar way, by retailing simplicity to the jaded sophisticate. But Burns was a poet, and he could not blind himself to the consequences of form. This sensitivity derails his career, and he dies romantically young and destitute; but he wrote some beautiful things.” (48)

I HATE THIS. Despite the rhetoric of being realistic and understanding about poetry as an occupation, it’s constantly drawing equivalences between commerciality and quality, and reinforcing the myth of the uncommercial beautiful genius.

Chapter 5: William Wordsworth
“Like Scott (and my other writers), Wordsworth was also profoundly interested in his readers, and profoundly interested in being a popular author. Wordsworth thought much more about success and failure than we tend to remember, and even though recen writing has taken / some notice of his interest in his readers we still remember the ‘fit audience’ of 1815 better than the anxously solicitous Wordsworth of the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads. Unlike Scott, though, Wordsworth’s methods resist popularity: he is constantly scolding and working on his reader, emphasizing moments of discomfort rather than passing them by.” (182-3)
“Poetic integrity does not, however, protect Wordsworth from becoming painfully frustrated by his lack of influence over his readers, as measured by their resistance to purchasing his books. Wordsworth wants to sell books: he wants people to read his books, be changed, and make him famous.” (183)
“For me and for Wordsworth, the proof is in the poetry” (187)
“‘Peter Bell’ s not a bad poem; it is a funny, wry poem, and a sincere poem too; it has more of the zany energies of the lyrics of 1798 than the staid proprieties of its published date, 1819. It is, however, a failed poem: it cannot fulfill its impossible desire of including the whole poetic world inside itself. It fails at the limits of poetry.” (194) It’s also an infamous commercial flop!!!
WW’s 1815 essay is the peak and the end of his obsession w popularity — expresses frustration, then formulates protective argument that greatness is unpopular (194-5). “There is a desperation about the whole argument, and no wonder, since one of its tasks is to prove Shakespeare unpopular.” (195)

            <Text>“two pervasive theoretical assumptions" implicit in the current canon debate: (6)
1. term ‘canon’ as replacement for ‘classics’ seeks to critique 'classics’, and treats the “traditional curriculum of literary texts" as equivalent to a closed and normative object akin to the scriptural canon. (6)
--- interrogate: is the selection of religious texts actually similar, historically, to the selection of literary texts? (a historical Q subject to proof or disproof) (6)
2. assumed similarity between exclusion (in which social minorities are excluded from power of political representation) and selection (by which some works are deemed canonical and others noncanonical). assumes that the solution is easy, add minorities to canon. (7)
--- interrogation: there is *some* relationship between minorities in power and minorities in canon, but what is it? the university intervenes between these two sites of representation. (7)

“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
the ultimate “policy" position of opening the canon is seen as too politically important to allow theoretical objections to complicate its plan (because canonical representation is now standing in for political representation) (11)

Essentialist assumptions in liberal pluralism
“The sense in which a canonical author represents a dominant social group, or a noncanonical author a socially defined minority, is continuous with the sense in which the work is perceived to be immediately expressive of the author's experience as a representative member of some social group. ... The author returns in the critique of canon, not as the genius, but as the representative of a social identity.” (10)
"it has seemed necessary to many progressive critics to present certain texts by minority authors as intrinsically noncanonical, as unassimilable to the traditional canon.” (9)

Need to consider class
his post-Marxist critique is different from a liberal pluralist critigue because he is "insisting on the theoretical and practical incommensurabiliy of the terms race, class, and gender: the modes of domination and exploitation specific to each of these socially defined minorities thus cannot be redressed by the _same_ strategy of representation.” (11)
"The fact of incommensurability explains why the revisionist critique of the canon has in practice been incapable of identifying 'noncanonical' works by lower-class writers who are not already identified by race or gender.” (14)
lumping together race, class, and gender as all "noncanonical” "equates their works as the expression of analogous experiences of marginalization” (11)

"The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
"Within the history of canon formation we will always be able to discern the arrangement and rearrangement of (1) an institutional practice, or pedagogy; (2) a body of preserved and disseminated writings, or canon; and (3) a produced linguistic knowledge” (71)
“Canonical texts, institutionally preserved and disseminated, constitute the paradigmatic basis of literary language, the guarantor at the lower educational levels of simple grammatical speech, the exemplar, at higher levels, of more expansive as well as more elite standards of linguistic use (stylistic or rhetorical rather than simply grammatical norms)” (68)
“If the term 'literature' can be retained to indicate a transhistorical phenomenon at all, it would have to be defined as the canonical genres of writing, whatever these genres happen to be in any particular time or place, and whatever name may have been given to them collectively. We are speaking, then, of certain genres of writing which become paradigmatic for a socially differentiated speech." (69)
“while the standard or 'common' language seems to efface social stratification by making language itself the vehicle of common national identity, the 'literary’ language reinstates at another level a linguistic difference by which the upper classes can continue to mark their cultural distinction.” (78)
the language taught in composition classes “is employed in its place, the ‘office.’ It is not 'everyday' language.” (79), and “its production bypasses the older literary syllabus altogether.” (79)
“The school functions as a system of credentialization by which it produces a specific /relation/ to culture. That relation is different for different people, which is to say that it reproduces social relations." (56)
“The educational institution performs the social function of systematically regulating the practices of reading and writing by governing access to the means of literary production as well as to the means of consumption (the knowledge required to read historical works)." (19)

"So far from being the case that the canon determines the syllabus in the simple sense that the syllabus is constrained to select only from canonical works, it is much more historically accurate to say that the syllabus posits the existence of the canon as its imaginary totality.” (31)
the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)

"The literary curriculum is precisely not the side of mass cultural production and consumption, but the critique of the canon has proceeded as though it were, as though canon formation were like the Academy Awards. ... in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site.” (8)

“The distinction between serious and popular writing is a condition of canonicity” (23)
he's sort of addressing the idea that women are associated with "unserious”, “ephemeral" writing possibly due to sexism which sees women's writing as inherently unserious and ephemeral... but mostly he's talking about popular vs serious (23)

"Institutions of reproduction succeed by taking as their first object not the reproduction of social relations but the reproduction of the institution itself.” (Guillory 57) --MEMES. Do I need meme theory in the diss??

Rebutting the ‘exclusion’ hypothesis
“The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” (15) — yes: and the presence of women in a genre generally made it seem to be ephemeral rather than serious… which isn't QUITE exclusion, but also doesn't seem like it's what Guillory is noting
"the historical process of canon formation, even or especially at the moment of institutional judgment, is too complex to be reduced to determination by the single factor of the social identity of the author” (17) gender may contribute somewhat to the reception of a given author, but it cannot in itself *explain* canonical/noncanonical status
“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is what any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as /excluded/ from the canon.” (16)
"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the /actively/ excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)

Actually, syllabi are created by selection
"Anyone who studies historical literatures knows that the archive contains an indefinite number of works of manifest cultural interest and accomplishment. While these works might be regarded as 'noncanonical' in some pedagogic contexts -- for example, the context of the ‘great works’ survey -- their noncanonical status is not necessarily equivalent in anyone's judgment to a zero-degree of interest or value.” (30)
“Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To contend otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
"This is finally why the project of legitimizing noncanonical works in the university produces an irresolvable contradiction between the presentation of these works as equal in cultural value to canonical works, and at the same time as the embodiment of countercultural values which by their very definition are intended to delegitimize the cultural values embodied in canonical works.” (47)
“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)

“the current critique of the canon both discovers, and misrepresents, the obvious fact that the older the literature, the less likely it will be that texts by socially defined minorities exist in sufficient numbers to produce a 'representative' canon" (15) —  but is this ACTUALLY true??
“Obviously in order to ‘open' this canon, one would have to modernize it, to displace the preponderance of works from earlier to later. And there are of course many good reasons to do so. The pressure to modernize the curriculum has succeeded again and again” (32)

"The decline of the humanities was never the result of newer noncanonical courses or texts, but of a large-scale 'capital flight' in the domain of culture.” (45)
“The relative decline of literary study in the schools is proof that the status of literary works as cultural capital depends to a significant degree upon their status as linguistic capital." (81)
“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its /market/ value." (46)
“If the liberal arts curriculum still survives as the preferred course of study in some elite institutions, this fact has everything to do with the class constituency of these institutions. …it is only those students who belong to the financially secure upper classes who do not feel compelled to acquire professional or technical knowledge as undergraduates." (46)
university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
“There is not, and should not be, one national culture, but there is, and there should be, one educational system." (53) in order to avoid social re-stratification

“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works [by minorities] /because they are important and significant cultural works/. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
"The fact that we no longer read these [classical] works in Greek or Latin, or that we read far fewer classical Greek or Latin works than students of premodern school systems, represents a real loss; but this loss must be reckoned as the price of the /integration/ of these works into a modern curriculum. The inevitable loss of older works in any humanities curriculum…is the result, as we have observed, of the /absolute/ accumulation of cultural works.” (51)
"A politically effective critique of literary education would be better served now by discarding the problematic of representation for a problematic whose object is the systematic constitution and distribution of cultural capital. For if social groups now imagine that they are too different to speak the same language, or to be represented by the same cultural works in the schools, they are nevertheless always exchanging the same currency, even in the symbolic form of cultural capital.” (82)</Text>

            <Text>PRINT, PUBLICITY, AND POPULAR RADICALISM IN THE 1790S
JON MEE
Subject
Page 17
Page 17:
my approach is particularly concerned with the emergence of popular radicalism through experiment, contestation, and performance, especially in its relations to the medium of print

Page 17:
Print made it possible to think of consulting and mediating what Thelwall called ‘the whole will of the nation

Page 17:
the participants themselves shared important assumptions and ideas about print, not least the deep faith they frequently showed in its efficacy as an agent of emancipation

Page 17:
The passing of the Two Acts in 1795 severely curtailed the activities of the popular societies and provides a partial endpoint to this study.

Page 18
Page 18:
Placing this study within the series ‘Cambridge Studies in Romanticism’ implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of ‘literary’ culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies. If aspects of this approach are ‘literary’ in general terms, the book is not intended to provide a backdrop to Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights.5 In certain respects, this formation and the associated identification of the literary with what John Thelwall called ‘sallies of the imagination’ were the product of a crisis brought on by the emergence of the popular radical culture opened up in this book, but the story is not a straightforward one. Thelwall himself could identify ‘literature’ both with a domain of imagination separable from politics and with print as the principal engine of emancipatory change.
This is where Mee addresses the "But Is It Literature" question

Page 18:
My aim has been to pay attention to the everyday labours of the radical societies in creating a public sphere through print and associated practices

Page 19
Page 19:
Robert Thomson’s efforts writing and collecting for the LCS songs – discussed in Chapter 2

Page 19:
a period when radical discourse was largely concerned with a split between the represented and the unrepresented, between a narrow identification of the political nation with the elite and a broader idea of ‘the people’

Page 19:
Gerrald became a flamboyant hero of the struggle in 1793; his fate – transportation to Botany Bay and an early death – made him a print celebrity to the radical societies in 1794–5 and beyond

Page 20
Page 20:
The progressive education both received from Parr seems to have taken fire at the French Revolution and driven them into contact with men from very different social backgrounds.13 Friends of Merry saw in this process – discussed in detail in Chapter 3 – a fundamental loss of social identity

Page 20:
A more precipitous descent can be traced in Charles Pigott – tracked in Chapter 4

Page 20:
respect for literary talents with the pen did not simply translate into social deference

Page 21
Page 21:
the clerk Richard ‘Citizen’ Lee, who first appeared in print as the religious poet ‘Ebenezer’, before the period of a few months transformed him into Citizen Lee, a journey traced more fully in Chapter 5

Page 21:
Literary aspirations were not necessarily the equivalent of a desire for self-expression that placed a premium on the individual over the struggle

Page 21:
Men like Reid and Thelwall may have been first drawn to a career in print on the assumption that the republic of letters in its proper form was a sphere open to talents underwritten by the freedom of the press, but they soon discovered that this was far from the case and pressed for a more genuinely accessible domain

Page 21:
In so far as they can be reconstructed from the archive, these backstories also indicate that the popular radicalism of the 1790s was the product of forces that reached back before 1789, even as they were crucially influenced by the sense of the French Revolution as an unprecedented event.

Page 21:
radicalism in the 1790s was not the expression of a coherent ideological code or language, but the product of the social practices of the surrounding culture

Page 23
Page 23:
This book understands radical culture as a complex and unstable field of forces, ‘fragmented’ as Mark Philp has it

Page 23:
Most historians of print identify a takeoff in the number of imprints from as early as the 1760s.

Page 24
Page 24:
Print was often taken to be the precondition for discussion and debate.

Page 24:
he understood the printing of the LCS’s first Address in 1792 as the moment when it became public

Page 24:
At certain points the societies seem to operate under the spell of ‘print magic’, that is, a faith that print could liberate mankind simply by bringing ideas into printed circulation.

Page 25
Page 25:
Part I of this book explores these conditions of mediation. Chapter 1 is concerned with the key concepts of print and publicity and their relation to complicating issues of space and gender.

Page 26
Page 26:
As with much of the broader associational world of clubs and societies, women seem to have played little official part in the popular radical societies

Page 26:
More generally, though, the LCS seems to have conformed to masculine definitions of citizenship and related practices, not least in the homosocial environment of singing and toasting at dinners.

Page 26:
Chapter 2 takes a chronological route through 1792–5, tracing the way in which print formats and practices were elaborated and tested across different popular radical groups

Page 26:
How were they to identify and give form to the ‘general will’ of the people?

Page 26:
The commitment to the circulation of political information in the societies accepted Rousseau’s assumption that ‘the general will is always right, but the judgment by which it is directed is not always sufficiently informed’.

Page 27
Page 27:
‘the scattered million’ and ‘the people’

Page 27:
In terms of their everyday practice, the primary focus of this book, the radical societies encouraged an ongoing process of debate indebted to Paine’s idea that ‘discussion and the general will, arbitrates the question, and to this private opinion yields with a good grace, and order is preserved uninterrupted’.36 They self-consciously tasked themselves with what Seth Cotlar calls ‘the difficult process of constructing and sustaining an incessantly deliberative, politically efficacious and professedly inclusive mechanism for forming and discerning the general will’.
i.e., they're trying to carry out consensus-based decision making

Page 27:
Gilmartin’s acknowledgement of an alternative tendency ‘to treat internal conflict as the consequence of error or government interference, something to be corrected rather than negotiated’. ‘Print magic’, understood, as it

Page 28
Page 28:
rarely was, in its purest form, often represented differences only as the ‘prelude to some final reconciliation or union, not a permanent condition to be addressed through ongoing procedures of public arbitration.’
But this just sounds like the Sharehouse principle that all problems have solutions

Page 28:
Thompson understood the LCS primarily in terms of a class coming to consciousness. Since then literary scholars and historians have offered a diversity of accounts that have moved on from the Thompsonian model in their accounts of the radical societies.

Page 28:
I examine public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS’s name.

Page 28:
This book is very much indebted to those enquiries, but is more concerned with the attempts of the societies to create a role within a broader public sphere prior to the narrowing of opportunity after the Two Acts passed into law.

Page 29
Page 29:
the role of print personality as a form of mediation, that is, both attacks on personalities by the radical press

Page 29:
but also the development of personae by writers and booksellers

Page 29:
Many radical authors and booksellers created identities that functioned as nodal points in the flow of political information and could compete for attention in a world where personality was becoming a key aspect of publicity in the theatre and the newspapers.

Page 30
Page 30:
Eaton at ‘the Cock and Swine’ and Lee at his ‘Tree of Liberty’ participated in a print marketplace where personality mattered as an interface between print and its readers.

Page 30:
Part II of this book attends to the question of personality by looking at Thelwall as one among four different radical careers. Two of my case studies, Robert Merry and Charles Pigott, were radicals from above

Page 30:
Citizen Lee and John Thelwall are more obviously representative of the LCS’s claim to represent ‘the people’

Page 30:
For many, this broader moral programme depended on a religious vision of the ‘human’, although no less invested in various forms of print mediation, whereas for others religion contradicted what they saw as an Enlightenment imperative towards rational debate.

Page 31
Page 31:
More broadly, the radical societies continued to have strong international contacts

Page 31:
Popular radical publicity aimed, in Redhead Yorke’s words, at a ‘complete revolution of sentiment’.

Page 32
Page 32:
Their faith in the power of print and publicity was bracing in this regard, but also brought with it vulnerabilities, not least a tendency to see an unfolding moral revolution as the necessary result of the story of print.</Text>

            <Text>Perhaps indicating that Guillory was correct, twenty years later, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain” (Guillory 265), now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” (“Conjectures” 55) is the problem of conceiving of world literature, rather than the “canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature” (55). His new methods are meant to enable literary studies to examine a new object. The field of distant reading has been moving away from Moretti himself. However, it is still shaped by the attempt to redefine the disciplinary domain of literary studies. In many cases, the new domain is no longer the “canon” but the “corpus,” a collection of texts which are studied en masse for macroanalytical insights. Katherine Bode, for example, in “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ and ‘Distant’ Reading,” argues that Moretti and Matthew Jockers replicate the approaches of New Criticism with their corpora, and calls for “a new scholarly object of analysis” (79) that directly examines historical and textual context of corpora as representations of “literary systems” (97). Lauren Klein, too, treats the textual corpus as the new object of literary analysis requiring curation, contextualization, and interpretation. Her critique argues that “it’s not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading can’t do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so” (n. pag.). Bode, too, despite her strong critique of distant reading as it has been practiced by Moretti and Jockers, does not blame distant reading itself. Distant-readers like Moretti and Jockers, she argues, “while claiming direct and objective access to ‘everything,’ … represent and explore only a very limited proportion of the literary system, and do so in an abstract and ahistorical way” (78). Klein, like Bode, calls for “more corpora—more accessible corpora—that perform the work of recovery or resistance” to allow research “beyond quote ‘representative’ samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole” (n. pag.). This framing re-creates, at the cite of the corpus, the identical narratives of exclusion and representation which were previously located in critiques of the canon.</Text>

            <Text>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THIS INFORMATION? Lauren Klein’s paper at MLA 2018, “Distant Reading after Moretti,” in fact poses the turn away from Moretti as an urgent imperative: “what do we do about distant reading, now that we know that Franco Moretti, the man who coined the phrase ‘distant reading,’ and who remains its most famous exemplar, is among the men named as a result of the #MeToo movement” \cite{Klein:2018to}? Klein, drawing on Sara Ahmed’s observation that “sexual harassment is a structural, as well as personal problem,” draws together critiques of distant reading’s exclusion of women in terms of its “issues of representation in the field,” its “unduly masculinized rhetorical positioning,” its “failure to engage with the conceptual issues that relate to women,” and the “actual computational models of gender that are often deployed” \cite{Klein:2018to}. All of these critiques of distant reading, Klein argues, show that “it’s not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading can’t do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so” \cite{Klein:2018to}</Text>

My interest in noncanonical works stems from a desire to recognize the real variety of responses expressed throughout the period in question. Even when one literary affective mode is at its peak popularity, other opinions are being expressed and other tools are being employed. [Just because an idea doesn’t “win” its year doesn’t make it uninteresting; rather, the opposite.] Moreover, individual authors evolve in opinion over time, and even individuals works change in meaning over time, hence my interest in timeliness.</Text>

“Identifying Authorial Gender in Eighteenth Century Databases.” University of Toronto Graduate English Conference. Toronto, ON, April 24.

Please submit abstracts of 250-300 words and a brief bio of 50 words to uoftenglishconference2020@gmail.com.

Bio: Lawrence Evalyn is a Ph.D. Candidate in English at the University of Toronto, specializing in computational approaches to eighteenth century literature.

Abstract: This paper will examine how contemporary digital databases of eighteenth century literature have remediated the cultural production of the 1790s through choices of which texts to make digitally accessible. Despite the importance of corpus-building (that is, the accumulation of a large body of text files for analysis) to the interpretation of “distant reading” research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. My research studies literature of the 1790s, a time when literary canons were being reinvented in England, to examine processes of selection in the eighteenth century and today. For the decade 1789-99, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts — the source for most distant reading research on eighteenth century literature — includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? I have written a program which infers a gender for the named authors of the works recorded in three major eighteenth century databases. (As my paper will discuss, inferring a gender from a name would not be tenable for a modern literary corpus, but is not inappropriate for the strong emphasis on binary gender in eighteenth century title pages.) By comparing the gender representation within different digital resources, I present a case study in recognizing the inequalities which may underly apparently neutral research resources.</Text>

            <Title>de-emphasize The Author</Title>
            <Text>You could include author bios at at author's first appearance, but the whole system of biographical readings would break down.. instead, there would have to be running historical contextualization. It would make current ways of teaching inconvenient, but perhaps in productive ways: if you wanted to read a bunch of poems by one author, students would have to skip past the other writing that was produced in between, a tangible reminder of the time that actually did separate those works. It also makes it easier to sub in less "important" authors, when you're looking for a work to fill just one chronological slice rather, than an author whose ouevre will be broadly applicable.</Text>

            <Text>Algee-Hewitt, Mark. “Acts of Aesthetics: Publishing as Recursive Agency in the Long Eighteenth Century.” Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net, no. 57 no. 57 (May 2, 2017): 1–22. doi:10.7202/1006517ar.


p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017

p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017

p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017

p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: the -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: erage date of composition of the first is 1757 and the second is 1775. These results suggest that the language of aesthetic compositionexperiences a substantive change within the eighteenth century and, moreover, give us a chronological outline through which we can begin to -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: pinpoint these transformations -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  these chronological limits coincide with the beginnings of the radical increase in -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017

p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017

p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017

p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017

p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: hmm -- I've been trying to resist my impulses toward tidy clustering; sometimes text are outliers, and a long tail is to be expected.. not everything reduces down to a few categories -- Written May 2, 2017

            <Synopsis> Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.

Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.</Synopsis>

            <Text>“It makes more sense to see the model as a physical or digital representation of a product or process, while a simulation is actually the reconfigurative use of a model to reveal new and potential aspects of a model. So a model can reveal or explain current states of a system, but a simulation can reveal new and hitherto unimagined potential states and possibilities of a system.

The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness.

            <Title>biased corpora</Title>
            <Text>** Use the word vector exercises from DH2018 workshop

Word embeddings allow for analogy checking. For example, man is to king as woman is to queen, expressed as man:king :: woman:queen, has its reflection on the vector representions of the words man, king, woman, queen in such a way that  king→−man→+woman→≈queen→king→−man→+woman→≈queen→ . However, this can also highlight some biases in the specific corpora the model has been trained on. Using as a base the pair she-he, find the most similar term for female from the term in the next list: doctor, captain, gallant, sheriff, engineer, scientist, author, surgeon, honorable, philosopher, warrior, architect, magician, liar, and coward. 
When possible, compute the similarity between the expected term for female and the one for male. Use the Google News (2015), English Fiction (1900, 1950) and Genre-Balanced American English (1900, 1950) embeddings. For example, using the English Fiction 1850 embeddings, he:gallant :: she:x solves to x=gentle, and the similarity between gallant and gentle is ~0.418. Can you spot the problem? 
Hint: Use Gensim's most_similar_cosmul()/most_similar() and similarity() functions

Really cherry-picking the "interesting" results; scroll right past the total nonsense and latch onto anything that can be vaguely thinks

By comparing how different the he:X :: she:X results are, we can quantify the gendered bias within the corpus, to skeptically evaluate our corpora

Very hard to remove gendered bias without removing the other relationships that interest us

Not just corpora that are biased; because the algorithm depends on the corpus, it will become biased too</Text>

He spoke of Cowper as the best modern poet. He said the Lyrical Ballads were an experiment about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been attempted, and making use only of such words as had probably been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.”</Text>

            <Text>“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The ‘means’ in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)
“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)
“The literary syllabus is the institutional form by means of which this knowledge is disseminated, and it constitutes capital in two senses: First, it is linguistic capital, the means by which one attains to a socially credentialed and therefore valued speech” (ix)
“And second, it is symbolic capital, a kind of knowledge-capital whose possession can be displayed upon request and which thereby entitles its possessor to the cultural and material rewards of the well-educated person.” (Ix)
“The form we call ‘literature’ organizes the syllabus and determines criteria of selection much more directly than the particular social biases of judgment which have been invoked to explain the canonical or noncanonical status of particular authors.” (Xiii)
“The most politically strategic argument for revising the canon remains the argument that the works so revalued are important and valuable cultural works. If literary critics are not yet in a position to recognize the inevitability of the social practice of judgment, that is a measure of how far the critique of the canon still is from developing a sociology of judgment. The theory of cultural capital elaborated in this book is an attempt to construct just such a sociology.” (Xiv)</Text>

            <Title>combine in Goldsmith</Title>
            <Text>A particularly interesting text which might reward a study of both its timeliness and its use of feeling is Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, which was first published in 1766 but continued to be frequently reprinted in the 1790s. The persistence of Wakefield immediately undermines any literary history which wholly relegates the sentimental novel to the 1760s and 1770s. However, by the 1790s Wakefield is no longer competing with The Man of Feeling (which many of its former dedicated readers now regarded with embarassment), and instead was read alongside the contemporary literature of sensibility in the Gothic mode. There is much still to be uncovered about how readers in the 1790s made very different sense of this work’s political and religious sermons, dramatic and moving prison scenes, and moralizing love-plot.</Text>

            <Text>Plan of Study
A recent article by Kathleen Bode calling for a “data-rich literary history” exemplifies a current shift in digital humanities research. Bode critiques pioneers of distant reading and literary macroanalysis Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they use as proof of their arguments. As an alternative, Bode calls for an integration of computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799, to redefine our understanding of the definitive works of this decade.
Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 titles published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. The 1790s saw the emergence of popular novels, Romantic poetry, and radical political philosophy. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole, and a selective literary canon began to take form.
My dissertation consists of two major experiments. The first experiment centres on the books and booklets (which I collectively term “titles”) printed during this decade, to identify which titles are most popular by mutiple metrics, and to challenge past oversimplifications of popularity. I write my own small computer programs to combine the 1790s holdings of twenty databases. Because these programs do not need to be fully developed into software for general use, I can write them quickly and independently. I will compare which titles appear in which archives, identify reprints, and use topic modelling to categorize their general contents. This work will allow me to identify material (such as sermons) that has been systematically excluded from specialized digital archives, revealing how these archives re-inscribe a literary canon. This phase of the project has completed data collection and begun experimentation; analysis will be complete by March 2019.
The OGS would therefore primarily fund the second experiment, which will occupy the fifth year of my five-year PhD program. This experiment turns from texts to their makers, undertaking a comprehensive mapping focused on persons, rather than titles. In addition to distinguishing between ‘high’ and ‘low’ literary content, the 1790s saw a distinction between ‘mainstream’ and ‘marginal’ (usually politically radical) writers and publishers. However, the nature of the radicals’ marginalization is in question. Building off of existing resources like the British Book Trade Index database and Linked Open Data frameworks, I will create a network graph of all authors, publishers, and printers operating in England 1789 to 1799. The primary technical challenge to this project, as in the first project, will be rendering existing data interoperable; I will again write small programs to adapt and manipulate this data until it is possible to visualize the social network underlying a decade of print production. I will then examine this social network to see if it does, indeed, display a distinct ‘mainstream’. The graph may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, I will analyse the shape the network ultimately displays, to either reaffirm or redefine our understanding of eighteenth century radical print culture.
The project as a whole builds off of scholarship in both the digital humanities and bibliography, providing missing links between disparate fragments of information. By correlating this information, I can revise our understanding of the most popular works during a volatile decade of literary history, and establish a methodology for future computational work.

            <Text>“The preliminary remarks on the question of value in Chapter 1 argue that the process of canon formation cannot be reduced to acts of evaluation in the simple sense of affirming or rejecting the specific values assumed to be expressed in a literary work.” (269)

“a certain impasse in the debate about the canon follows from the fundamental assumptions of liberal pluralism itself. This impasse is visible, for example, when the distinction between 'canonical' and 'noncanonical' works is institutionalized in two very different and even contradictory ways: as the canonization of formerly noncanonical works, and as the development of distinct and separate noncanonical programs of study." (3)
"the vulnerability of curricular revision to attack from the right is one consequence of the contradiction between integrationist and separatist conceptions of curricular revision, a / contradiction that can be traced to theoretical problems with pluralism itself, and that threatens to disable an effective response to the conservative backlash.” (3-4)
language of revision comes from a specifically American political culture -- have to historicize them &amp; acknowledge this context to solve underlying problems
“however easy it has been for both progressive academics and their reactionary critics to conflate the critique of the canon with the forms of leftist and even Marxist thought, the terms and methods of canonical revision must be situated squarely within the prevailing conventions of American pluralism." (4)
ONE kind of ‘representation': “Within traditional liberal pluralist thought, individuals are conceived in their relation to the state as members of groups whose interests are assumed to conflict. Hence the object of representing these groups within the legislative institutions of the state is to negotiate among the interests of particular social groups” (4)
universities are interested in 'representation in the canon' because representation in politics (its proper place) is seen to have failed -- as liberal pluralism is purged from society its last bastions adopt its defensive positions rigidly and with high stakes (5)
“two pervasive theoretical assumptions" implicit in the current canon debate: (6)
1. term ‘canon’ as replacement for ‘classics’ seeks to critique 'classics’, and treats the “traditional curriculum of literary texts" as equivalent to a closed and normative object akin to the scriptural canon. (6)
--- interrogate: is the selection of religious texts actually similar, historically, to the selection of literary texts? (a historical Q subject to proof or disproof) (6)
2. assumed similarity between exclusion (in which social minorities are excluded from power of political representation) and selection (by which some works are deemed canonical and others noncanonical). assumes that the solution is easy, add minorities to canon. (7)
--- interrogation: there is *some* relationship between minorities in power and minorities in canon, but what is it? the university intervenes between these two sites of representation. (7)
"The literary curriculum is precisely not the side of mass cultural production and consumption, but the critique of the canon has proceeded as though it were, as though canon formation were like the Academy Awards. ... in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site.” (8)
"it has seemed necessary to many progressive critics to present certain texts by minority authors as /intrinsically/ noncanonical, as unassimilable to the traditional canon.” (9)
"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the /actively/ excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)
—&gt; the stuff I'm doing comparison databases will probably show that it's NOT, e.g., social repression of women which has led to various exclusions, but a series of convenience principles
“The sense in which a canonical author represents a dominant social group, or a noncanonical author a socially defined minority, is continuous with the sense in which the work is perceived to be immediately expressive of the author's /experience/ as a representative member of some social group. ... The author returns in the critique of canon, not as the genius, but as the representative of a social identity.” (10)
“the coherent identity demanded by a practice assuming the perfect fit of identity and experience is in fact unavailable to anyone” (10)
liberal pluralism's emphasis on identity in determining canonical status is essentialist (10)
the ultimate “policy" position of opening the canon is seen as too politically important to allow theoretical objections to complicate its plan (because canonical representation is now standing in for political representation) (11)
lumping together race, class, and gender as all "noncanonical” "equates their works as the expression of analogous experiences of marginalization” (11)
his post-Maxist critique is different from a liberal pluralist critigue because he is "insisting on the theoretical and practical incommensurabiliy of the terms race, class, and gender: the modes of domination and exploitation specific to each of these socially defined minorities thus cannot be redressed by the _same_ strategy of representation.” (11)
treating all minorities as equivalent, and defined by their oppression, is bad and useless politics (12)
“If liberal pluralism has discovered that the cultural is always also the political (which it is), it has seldom escaped the trap of reducing the political to the cultural.” (13)
“The underlying theoretical problem here… [is] … theoretical slippage between the concepts of ‘subject' and ‘identity’” (13)
"The fact of incommensurability explains why the revisionist critique of the canon has in practice been incapable of identifying 'noncanonical' works by lower-class writers who are not already identified by race or gender.” (14)
"the category of 'social identity' is entirely inadequate to explain how particular works become canonical in the first place” (15)
“the current critique of the canon both discovers, and misrepresents, the obvious fact that the older the literature, the less likely it will be that texts by socially defined minorities exist in sufficient numbers to produce a 'representative' canon" (15) —  but is this ACTUALLY true??
“The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from /access to literacy/, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral.” (15) — yes: and the presence of women in a genre generally made it seem to be ephemeral rather than serious… which isn't QUITE exclusion, but also doesn't seem like it's what Guillory is noting
“If current research has recovered a number of otherwise forgotten women writers from the period before the eighteenth century, this fact is not directly related to canon formation as a process of selection or exclusion on the basis of social identity, but to the present institutional context of a valid and interesting /research program/ whose subject is the history of women writers and writing. No other defense is required for studying these writers than the aim of the research program (and these could well be /political/ aims. It is not necessary to claim canonical status for noncanonical works in order to justify their study” (15)
“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is what any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as /excluded/ from the canon.” (16)
"The hypothesis of exclusion" is “a misrecognition of the political work accomplished by the research program”, which “has certain political consequences, since it effaces the historical significance of literacy in the history of writers and writing.” (16)
"the historical process of canon formation, even or especially at the moment of institutional judgment, is too complex to be reduced to determination by the single factor of the social identity of the author” (17) gender may contribute somewhat to the reception of a given author, but it cannot in itself *explain* canonical/noncanonical status
“the categories of race and gender are contemporary conditions of canon formation; they are historically specific" (17)
“An 'institutional’ fact such as literacy has everything to do with the relation of 'exclusion' to social identity; but exclusion should be defined not as exclusion from representation but from access to the /means of cultural production/.” (18)
"literacy is a question of the distribution of cultural goods rather than the representation of cultural images” (18)
“pluralism can only apprehend the history of canon formation as a history of consumption, the history of the judgment of cultural products” but obviously production must precede this (18)
“The educational institution performs the social function of systematically regulating the practices of reading and writing by governing access to the means of literary production as well as to the means of consumption (the knowledge required to read historical works)." (19)
"failure to reflect upon the most salient fact of the canon debate, its locus in the university. No one speaks there of the relation between canonical revision and the primary levels of the educational system, where for a much larger part of the population the content of the university curriculum is simply irrelevant.” (19)
"In the second phase of canonical critique, the curriculum became representative in another sense, by reflecting the /actual/ division of the social order into dominant and dominated social groups, each now represented by its own syllabus of works. In this context of representation, the ‘values' according to which works were canonized could themselves be called into question or declared to be simply incommensurable with the 'values’ embodied in subordinate cultures.” (19)
"On this account canonical and noncanonical works are by definition mutually exclusive; they confront each other in an internally divided curriculum the same way that hegemonic culture confronts nonhegemonic subcultures in the larger social order.” (20)
“pluralist critics of the canon would agree that canonical works do represent the 'ideals of Western civilization,' and that these ideas or values constitute a culture. Whether Homer, Shakespeare, Eliot, and Austen actually express in some homogenous way a culture of 'Western civilization' is not in question on either side of the debate” (but it should be, and it's a sign of pluralism’s failings that it agrees with the premises of the right wing) (21)
profs either have to stop teaching the canon (“an entirely logical alternative, if the teaching of canonical texts actually disseminates hegemonic values”) or frame the course around exposing them (21)
“three propositions about cultural value to which both progressive and reactionary critics would presumably assent, in order to remonstrate that these propositions are questionable” (22)
“1. Canonical texts are the repositories of cultural values.” (22)
“the pedagogic relation between value and the literary work is very much keyed to the level of the educational system." (22)
“At the level of the graduate school and the professional conference, the educational capital specific to that level can be signalled by a certain refusal of the 'great works’ characteristic of the lower levels of the system." (22)
"2. The selection of texts is the selection of values.” (23)
“The distinction between serious and popular writing is a condition of canonicity” (23)
he's sort of addressing the idea that women are associated with "unserious”, “ephemeral" writing possibly due to sexism which sees women's writing as inherently unserious and ephemeral... but mostly he's talking about popular vs serious
“how unhistorical it is to claim, as Jane Tompkins does in /Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction/, that popular fiction 'has been rigorously excluded from the ranks of 'serious' literary works,' as though the two categories did not define /each other/ in a system of literary production" (24) — serious works are inherently unpopular?
“The reversion to moralism is determined by the equation of text-selection with value-selection. For this reason much of what passes for political analysis of historically canonical works is nothing more than the passing of moral judgment on them.” (25)
"a fall into moralism will occur regardless of what values are set against the category of the asethetic” (25)
Jauss on horizon of expectations actually seems interesting / useful to me
“3. Value must be either intrinsic or extrinsic to the work." (26)
"the strategy of exposing intrinsic value as simply extrinsic has the curious effect of disabling at the outset any project of revaluation, where the object revalued is the work, and not (as in Tompkins) other extrinsic (moral) values.” (26)
"An individual's judgment that a work is great does nothing in itself to preserve that work, unless that judgment is made in a certain institutional context, a setting in which it is possible to insure the reproduction of the work, its continual reintroduction to generations of readers.” (28)
“The scene in which a group of readers, defined by a common social identity and common values, confronts a group of texts with the intention of making a judgment as to canonicity, is an /imaginary/ scene. That imaginary scene must now be set against what happens in a real place, the school.” (28)
is the constituency for Norton anthologies really UNIVERSITY students? are "textbooks" and "instruments of research" really synonymous??
it's anthology editors, not women or african americans, who decide what texts make up the “"alternative canon"" of Norton's anthologies of literature by women &amp; african american literature (29)
“judgments with canonical force are institutionally located.” (29)
“It is nevertheless an interesting consequence of the canon debate that is has called every act of judgment into question, not simply because judgment is always historical, local, or institutional, but more profoundly because it is exercised at all.” (29)
"The curious logic of this argument conflates the syllabus, a selection of texts for study in a particular institutional context, with the canon itself" (29)
“In no classroom is the 'canon' itself the object of study. Where does it appear, then? It would be better to say that the canon is an /imaginary/ totality of works." (30)
"Anyone who studies historical literatures knows that the archive contains an indefinite number of works of manifest cultural interest and accomplishment. While these works might be regarded as 'noncanonical' in some pedagogic contexts -- for example, the context of the ‘great works’ survey -- their noncanonical status is not necessarily equivalent in anyone's judgment to a zero-degree of interest or value.” (30)
the canon isn't a list, but the syllabus (or curriculum of a program) is: when teachers say they've overthrown the canon, what they've actually done is revised a syllabus, “as it is only through the syllabus that they have any access to the imaginary list which is the canon." (30)
"So far from being the case that the canon determines the syllabus in the simple sense that the syllabus is constrained to select only from canonical works, it is much more historically accurate to say that the syllabus posits the existence of the canon as its imaginary totality.” (31)
“Obviously in order to ‘open' this canon, one would have to /modernize/ it, to displace the preponderance of works from earlier to later. And there are of course many good reasons to do so. The pressure to modernize the curriculum has succeeded again and again” (32)
"The fact that we read Plato but not Xenephon, Virgil but not Statius, has nothing to do with the social identities of Xenephon or Statius, something more to do with later evaluations of their relative interest; but the necessity of choosing between them has everything to do with the modernization of the curriculum, with the imperative of /making room/ for such later writers as Locke or Rousseau." (32)
“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)
"The syllabus has the form of a list, but the items on the list are given a specious unity by reference to a whole from which they are supposed to be a representative selection. ... The canon achieves its imaginary totality, then, not by embodying itself in a really existing list, but by retroactively constructing its individual texts as a /tradition/, to which works may be added or subtracted without altering the impression of totality or cultural homogeneity.” (33)
"The confusion of the syllabus with the canon thus inaugurates a pedagogy of misreading, wherein a given text's historical specificity is effaced as it is absorbed into the unity of the syllabus/canon.” (34)
"the present very anxious fixation on the canon… can be read as symptomatic of a certain anxiety associated with the perceived disunity of contemporary society." (34) — trying to create new cultural unities around gender, race, ethnicity, queerness
distinction between "community" and "association" -- pluralism misrecognizes minority cultures as communities when they are in fact associations (34)
the university is also an association, not a community (35)
we're really into lists (35)
E.D. Hirsch's /Cultural Literacy/ included a list of "what Hirsch believes to be a quantity of knowledge prerequisite to functional literacy" (35)
"The fetishized list is one symptom of... the ‘postmodern condition of knowledge’” (36)
"The form of the list forecloses any systemic analysis of its own terms on behalf of a nostalgia in which Agamemnon and Akron might truly belong to a ‘common culture.' The nonexistence of this culture, or its actual existence as mass culture, is just the fact which Hirsch's list both manifests and denies.” (36)
“the fetishized mass cultural form of the list, as an instance of the social imaginary, determines the form of the critique of the canon in the university, the fixation on the syllabus as an exclusive list.” (36)
“the pedagogic imaginary within which the critique of the canon has been advanced… constructs out of its alternative canon/syllabus/list a culture (or women writers, or Afro-American writers, etc.) more homogenous than it actually is” (37)
"The 'open' canon can lay claim to representational validity in the experience not of 'women' or ‘blacks' but of women or blacks in the university -- which is not itself a /representative/ place. The university is nevertheless a locus of real power (for the distribution of cultural capital), and therefore a good place for political praxis to define its object. Such an object should not be the imaginary alone, the canon as image” (37)
revising college curricula means little to people who don’t read the canon (38)
revising college curricula doesn't change lower-level curricula; while college curricula have been revised, lower levels have been getting worse (38)
section: "Multicultural Interlude: The Question of a Core Curriculum" (38)
schools don't transmit national culture, they transmit the culture of the school (38)
"The apparent failure of the university's cultural project of constituting a national culture elicits from the New Right the clamorous demand for a return to what was after all the /bourgeois/ school, the institution enabling the old bourgeoisie to identify itself culturally by acquiring the cultural capital formerly restricted to the aristocratic or clerical estates. The capital consisted of nothing other than the 'great works' of Western civilization." (40)
schools give access to and transmit works, not cultures (41)
"If works by Afro-American, Latin-American, or postcolonial writers are read now in formal programs of university study, this fact may be the immediate result of a political project of inclusion, or the affirmation of cultural diversity. But the survival of these works in future school curricula will be seen otherwise, as a consequence of their status as interesting and important cultural works that no intellectually responsible program of study can ignore.” (41)
“The homogenizing textual effects of deracination" unifies texts of ""Western culture”"  that are from vastly different cultures -- made obvious by the fact that we read them in translation (43)
"The function imposed upon schools of acculturating students in 'our' culture often thus requires that texts be read 'out of context,' as signs of cultural continuity, or cultural unity.” (43)
since the decling in the humanities is due to lower enrolment as students gravitate toward pre-professional tracks, why does it get blamed on prof's (supposed but false) refusal to teach Great Works?
“It has proven to be much easier to quarrel about the content of the curriculum than to confront the implications of a fully emergent professional-managerial class which no longer requires the cultural capital of the old bourgeoisie.” (45)
"The decline of the humanities was never the result of newer noncanonical courses or texts, but of a large-scale 'capital flight' in the domain of culture.” (45)
“I would propose, then, that the division now characterizing the humanities syllabus — between Western and multicultural, canonical and noncanonical, hegemonic and nonhegemonic works-- is the symptom of a more historically significant split between two kinds of cultural capital, one of which is ‘traditional,' the other organic to the constitution of the professional-managerial class.” (45)
“the debate... will have to move beyond the curricular distinction between the canonical and the noncanonical; it will have to raise the much larger question of what is at stake in the relation between the kinds of cultural capital.” (45)
“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its /market/ value." (46)
“If the liberal arts curriculum still survives as the preferred course of study in some elite institutions, this fact has everything to do with the class constituency of these institutions. …it is only those students who belong to the financially secure upper classes who do not feel compelled to acquire professional or technical knowledge as undergraduates." (46)
“It is not quite the case, then, that the New Right wishes to purge the university of all linguistic or ethnic others, but that it sets the university the project of unifying the new possessors of cultural capital by cultural means, by means of a ‘common' curriculum which will identify them as (justly) privileged.” (47)
“If this analysis is correct it does not seem the most effective strategy for the left to cede to the right the /definition/ of cultural capital; but this is exactly what multiculturalism does when it…accepts the right's characterization of the canonical syllabus as constitutive of a unified and monolithic Western culture.” (47)
"This is finally why the project of legitimizing noncanonical works in the university produces an irresolvable contradiction between the presentation of these works as equal in cultural value to canonical works, and at the same time as the embodiment of countercultural values which by their very definition are intended to delegitimize the cultural values embodied in canonical works.” (47)
"Both the right-wing attempt to shore up the cultural capital of ‘great works' by advocating a return to a core curriculum, and the pluralist advocacy of multiculturalism respond to the same demographic circumstances, the heterogeneous constituency of the university. But neither version of culturalist politics responds to the heterogeneous constitution of cultural capital, and hence both movements are condemned to register this condition symptomatically, as a false perception of the mutual (cultural) exclusivity of canonical and noncanonical works." (47)
Gramsci proposes a unitary school to foster equal access to citizenship, as an antidote for the stratification encouraged by technical schools (49)
the things he proposes as unitary, in America move farther from the common public schools and end up happened only in the first two years of university (49)
"The point of the unitary school is that it is a school for everyone; by definition it is not the university.” (50)
“It is perhaps time for progressive teachers to take back the humanities curriculum -- all of it -- as an integrated program of study.” (50)
“we can imagine that an integrated curriculum would supersede the distinction between canonical and noncanonical works in the recognition that a syllabus of study always enacts a negotiation between /historical/ works and /modern/ works. There is no question now, not has there ever been, of the inevitability of curricular change: the latter-day curriculum is the archaeological evidence of its own sedimented history. When we read Plato or Homer or Virgil in a humanities course, then, we are reading what /remains/ of the classical curriculum after the vernacular revolutions of the early modern period.” (51)
"The fact that we no longer read these works in Greek or Latin, or that we read far fewer classical Greek or Latin works than students of premodern school systems, represents a real loss; but this loss must be reckoned as the price of the /integration/ of these works into a modern curriculum. The inevitable loss of older works in any humanities curriculum…is the result, as we have observed, of the /absolute/ accumulation of cultural works.” (51)
“The reactionary defense of the traditional 'canon' thus betrays itself as ignorant of the cultural history sedimented in the very syllabus it desires to fix.” (51)
the syllabus isn't about the actual titles at all, it is “the means of providing /access/ to cultural works, both historical and modern” (51)
“Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To content otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
teaching ‘minority' works is important because it reflects the real diversity of the nation, and they are therefore important to everyone, not just to separate minority constituencies (52)
“the school has the social obligation of providing access to these works /because they are important and significant cultural works/. In this way we will disabuse ourselves and our students of the idea that canonical or noncanonical syllabi have natural constituencies, the members of dominant or subordinate cultures respectively." (52)
“There is not, and should not be, one national culture, but there is, and there should be, one educational system." (53) in order to avoid social re-stratification
intercultural literacy as substitute for national culture (53)
university curricular reform can help reform the educational system as a whole by reaffirming the cultural capital of literacy as distinct from technical and professional knowledge (54)
Section: "Literature as Cultural Capital: An Alternative Analysis”
“Canonicity is not a property of the work itself but of its transmission, its relation to other works in a collection of works -- the syllabus in its institutional locus, the school.” (55)
“Whatever the relation of the / work to its initial audience, it must certainly have other relations as a canonical work.” (55-56)
"The canon is thus not grounded in an ‘institution of criticism’” but in schools (56)
“The school functions as a system of credentialization by which it produces a specific /relation/ to culture. That relation is different for different people, which is to say that it reproduces social relations." (56)
the structure of the institution subordinates the historical specificity of individual works to the ideology of the canonical form (tradition), which leads to a homogenizing of dogmatic content (57)
"Institution of reproduction succeed by taking as their first object not the reproduction of social relations but the reproduction of the institution itself.” (57) --MEMES. Do I need meme theory in the diss??
syllabus reform has little impact on the education system as a whole or society at large (57)
"Canons of texts belong to the /durée/ of the school as both an objectification of ‘tradition' and as a list of text (syllabus, curriculum) continuously changing in response to the frictional relations between institutional and social reproduction. Yet the significance of this tension between the two sites of reproduction is concealed from revisionists of the canon, who see a direct relation between the canon and social struggle but misrecognize the institution mediating this relation as a mythical 'interpretive community,' or an autonomous ‘profession.’" (59)
“The objective history of canon formation…exhibits enormous variation, but this history can be recovered only in the context of the school” (59)
history of the distinction of “literary" texts (60)
“social reproduction is not effected directly through the contents of the curriculum” -- example of Roman empire teaching old-fashioned literature, but this was fine because the real goal was to teach the Latin language itself (61)
Roman classical texts chosen in order to teach grammar -- much of what survives today is because it was anthologised for this purpose (62)
“selections of texts historically have the appearance of having selected themselves" (62)
"The literary canon has always functioned in schools as a pedagogic device for producing an effect of linguistic distinction, of ‘literacy’." (62)
"Only in this way can one explain the use of the /same/ canonical works to inculcate in different generations of students many different and even incompatible ideologies.” (63)
"Authors cannot be said to write /for/ the educational system but in a determinate relation to it, /as the subjects it produces/. The history of canon formation belongs to the history of literary production, therefore, as a condition of production” (63)
“Authors confront a monumentalized textual tradition already immersed as speakers and writers in the social condition of linguistic stratification that betrays at every level the struggle among social groups…over cultural capital in its linguistic form.” (63)
“When these authors are joined to the frieze upon which they formerly gazed, the record of struggle seems to pass into oblivion as the unwritten. Yet that record is immediately available in the works themselves as the /language of literature/, out of which literature is made, and in the process of canon formation [the record is available] as the institutional intervention by which the literary curriculum becomes the pedagogic vehicle for producing the distinction between credentialed and uncredentialed speech." (63)
the “ideology of tradition...collapses the history of canon formation into an autonomous history of literature, which is always a history of writers and not of /writing/“ (63)
“A history of / writing would... have to pose first the question of what genres of writing count as 'literature' in a given historical context” (63-64)
“the first theoretical movement in the twentieth century explicitly to reject the concept of tradition, namely, Russian Formalism” (64)
will be helpful to use "the Bakhtin circle's reformulation of the question of literary language as the question not of an /essentially/ different kind of language (literariness) but of linguistic differentiation as a social fact." (64)
“The ontological groundlessness of literature in no way diminishes it social effects as a means of marking the status of certain texts and genres.” (65)
"the polarization of linguistic practices into the poetic or literary, and the ordinary or practical, generated an attractively simple and elegant model of historical transformation conceived as an oscillation between the processes of familiarization and defamiliarization" (65)
“‘Literary language' does indeed ride the crest of a historical wave, but not as the defamiliarized or the new. On the contrary, it forms at the interface between the language of preserved literary texts and the context-bound speech that continually escapes total regulation and hence /changes/. It is different from both." (67)
“the ‘older poetic genres’, preserved as nothing other than canonical texts, exert a kind of drag on the velocity of linguistic change, the product of which interaction is 'literary language’” (67)
“Bakhtin's description of the novel as a genre, specifically the 'noncanonical genre,' by which he means that it never develops generic rules (canons) even as it accumulates a repertoire of works. The novel as noncanonical genre is privileged for Bakhtin as the genre which welcomes the heteroglossic” (67)
“Literary language also changes, if at a slower pace than extraliterary language” (68)
“Canonical texts, institutionally preserved and disseminated, constitute the paradigmatic basis of literary language, the guarantor at the lower educational levels of simple grammatical speech, the exemplar, at higher levels, of more expansive as well as more elite standards of linguistic use (stylistic or rhetorical rather than simply grammatical norms)” (68)
“If the term 'literature' can be retained to indicate a transhistorical phenomenon at all, it would have to be defined as the canonical genres of writing, whatever these genres happen to be in any particular time or place, and whatever name may have been given to them collectively. We are speaking, then, of certain genres of writing which become paradigmatic for a socially differentiated speech." (69)
“Diglossia defined as a differentiation of social/linguistic function" (70)
“comparing the medieval curriculum, founded upon specialized discourses of knowledge (the trivium and quadrivium) with the curriculum of the early modern humanist schools, founded on a canon of classical literary works… this transition, which relegated to obscurity a great number of medieval works, has unfortunately appeared to literary historians primarily as a revaluation of particular authors and texts.” (70)
The Historical Forms of the Literary Canon
"Within the history of canon formation we will always be able to discern the arrangement and rearrangement of (1) an institutional practice, or pedagogy; (2) a body of preserved and disseminated writings, or canon; and (3) a produced linguistic knowledge” (71)
his history of literary canons enters the 18thC
"it is only vernacular writing that has the power to bring into existence the category of 'literature’ in the specific sense of poetry, novels, plays, and so on. The brackets that close around a particular set of genres at this time increasingly distinguish it on the one side from philosophical and scientific writing, and on the other from scripture” (76)
“The very fact that the body of literary works can be analogized to the scriptural 'canon' betrays the fact that vernacular writing must borrow the slowly fading aura of scripture as a means of enhancing and solidifying its new prestige.” (76)
“the ends of nationalism were served not simply by the establishment of vernacular classics but even more crucially by the use of the texts in the schools as a means of standardizing the vernacular language." (77)
“The existence of the novel at the interface between literate and illiterate culture produced a crisis in poetic production itself, symptomatically registered by the Romantic break with the 'poetic diction’ of eighteenth-century poetry, and its turn to a prose paradigm of ‘generalized literariness.’” (77)
“while the standard or 'common' language seems to efface social stratification by making language itself the vehicle of common national identity, the 'literary’ language reinstates at another level a linguistic difference by which the upper classes can continue to mark their cultural distinction.” (78)
“the cognate programs of composition and literature, yet another way in which 'different practices of the same language are inculcated in the school." (79)
"the program of composition has never been so limited as to identify grammaticality as its sole end; it has on the contrary posited grammaticality as the means to emancipatory political ends which are not finally different from the posited political ends of literary education. Like the law, grammar is the same for everyone, except of course that it is not.” (79)
the language taught in composition classes “is employed in its place, the ‘office.’ It is not 'everyday' language.” (79), and “its production bypasses the older literary syllabus altogether.” (79)
“Mistaking the class-based sociolect for the language of 'humanity' is an Enlightenment dream from which the political subject is not meant to awaken.” (80)
"The crisis of the literary syllabus is that it is indeed no longer such a privileged agent because it is no longer the basis of the vernacular standard.” (80)
“The relative decline of literary study in the schools is proof that the status of literary works as cultural capital depends to a significant degree upon their status as linguistic capital." (81)
“I shall continue to insist that the project of political integration is distinct from the project of cultural assimilation, and is in fact the basis for the latter's critique.” (82)
"A politically effective critique of literary education would be better served now by discarding the problematic of representation for a problematic whose object is the systematic constitution and distribution of cultural capital. For if social groups now imagine that they are too different to speak the same language, or to be represented by the same cultural works in the schools, they are nevertheless always exchanging the same currency, even in the symbolic form of cultural capital. In the case of literature the problematic of cultural capital will always return us to the question of the relation between the means of literary production and the institutions of social reproduction within which speakers succeed or fail to speak for themselves." (82)

Footnotes
“The phenomenon of "political correctness," recently the object of so much com- plaint in the right-wing media, can be seen in this context as the paradoxical tri- umph in the university of an otherwise defeated liberalism. It is not surprising that a progressive discourse, more or less routed in American culture, should find itself driven to police the borders of its diminished territory. As everyone on the left knows, the concept of political correctness was formulated within left discourse itself to critique the tendency to moralistic posturing provoked by the dire situation / of an increasingly reactionary social order. The usefulness of that concept is cer- tainly at an end, but one may continue to speak of "identity politics" or what I would call "radical liberalism," a specific style of political discourse and practice distinct from the historical forms of socialism and Marxism. The argument of this chapter with liberalism, both traditional and radical, is not with any of its progres- sive objectives, but with those assumptions of its theory and practice which, be- cause they are uncritically shared with American political culture in general, have disabled an effective response to the resurgence of reactionary politics. Taking the long view historically, there is considerable evidence for arguing that "identity poli- tics" is now American politics, and that what we call identity politics exists on the same continuum of "interest-group" politics with positions that are manifestly conservative or reactionary. Identity politics makes no conceptual break as a poli- tics with its precursors, even in its radical forms. I do not doubt that to those who are traumatized by the demise of liberalism, the alternative of a class-critique will seem even more quixotic; but it seems to me that it is in just this circumstance that a mode of systemic analysis recommends itself, and that certain foreclosed truths may become visible once again.” (342-343)

“See Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: To- wards a Radical Democratic Politics (London: Verso, 1985). Also interesting in this context, and perhaps neglected by literary postmodernists, is the work of Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, particularly their Democracy and Capitalism: Prop- erty, Community, and the Contradictions of Modern Social Thought (New York: Basic Books, 1986). Because Bowles and Gintis, unlike Laclau and Mouffe, are / writing in response to an indigenous liberal tradition, they tend to emphasize the necessity for socializing the economy at the same time that it is democratized. Laclau and Mouffe do not disagree, but the very intimacy of their struggle with the Continental Marxist tradition, and the consequent vehemence of their post- Marxism, has had the unfortunate effect of underemphasizing for American readers the socialist commitments they also claim as their own.” (343-344)

Else- where, it should be noted, Gates has produced very effective critiques of certain as- pects of the "representation" view of canon formation, among them the fetishizing of authenticity and individual experience. For a more complete view of the complex evolution of Gates's thinking on the subject of the canon, see his Loose Canons: Notes on the Culture Wars (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992).” (344)
“In this context, see David Harvey, "Flexibility: Threat or Opportunity?" in So- cialist Review 21 (1991), 74: "The postmodern embrace of ephemeral images, spectacle-type events, 'invented' traditions and heritages of all sorts, and perpetual novelty in the realm of cultural production deserves to be understood. . . . In recent years the cultural mass has pursued a whole host of political and ideological strug- gles that have general significance: anti-racism, feminism, and struggles concerning ethnic identiy, religious tolerance, cultural decolonization, and the like. Because postmodernism is associated with a democratization of voice within the cultural mass, many of the struggles against a central source of authority and power (white, male, elitist, and Protestant, for example) have enlisted under the postmodern ban- ner. I think it is fair to say that efforts to counter various forms of gender, racial, ethnic, or religious oppression have been more successful within the cultural mass than in many other segments of society. The problem is that these fights are being / waged within a relatively homogeneous class context, where issues of class oppres- sion, though always on the agenda for political reasons, are by no means as strongly and personally felt as they would be among, say, women factory workers in the Phil- ippines or Mexico." Harvey's understanding of the socioeconomic forces driving postmodern culture leads him to a thoroughgoing skepticism about the "ideologi- cal struggles" of the newly constituted cultural minorities. While I do not share the degree of Harvey's skepticism about the political significance of these struggles, there is a sense in which we might see the critique of the canon in the context of the new social movements as the latest version of a kind of left Hegelianism. The ideal- ism of this critique consists in the belief that in order to change the world it is only necessary to change our image of the world. This is a question not of the reality of images but of the virtual absence of economic or class analysis in liberal pluralist theory. The absence of such analysis permits First World pluralists to construe the question of postcolonialism, for example, primarily as one of rehabilitating our im- ages of the native cultures and identities of postcolonial populations, a program that does not begin to address the steadily worsening effects of what Immanuel Wal- lerstein has called the"capitalist world-system." See also Harvey's The Condition ofPostmodernity: An Enquiry into the Origins ofCultural Change (London: Basil Blackwell, 1980); also Immanuel Wallerstein, Geopolitics and Geoculture: Essays on the Changing World-System (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991).” (344-345)

“'fhe concept of a "minority author" should itself be submitted to critique. The unresolved contradiction between the assertion of equivalence vis-a-vis the experi- ence of marginalization or oppression and the assertion of difference at the level of specific gender, racial, or ethnic identity is one consequence of identity politics, and accounts for at least some of the tensions expressed between different minority groups over the actually quite limited resources available for compensating disad- vantaged groups. These tensions follow from the fact that the name of "minority" is superimposed upon specific gender, racial, or ethnic identities as another identity, a general identity which paradoxically effaces the very specificity which is the basis for the claim to that general identity. This contradiction can only be superseded in the recognition that the concept of "minority" names a historically determinate relation between dominant and subordinate social groups in a specific social con- text. The tensions between such groups in the practice of identity politics suggests that in identity politics' practice of traditional interest-group politics, the interest of the group is defined on the basis of a hypothetically preexistent identity (essential, if not natural), and not on the basis of an analysis of the objective conditions giving rise to that identity. Hence the apparent absence of analogy between, say, one's ra- cial identity, and one's identity as a "consumer"-but the obvious contingency of such "identities" as the latter is also the reason why it is so difficult to translate class position into the identity of "minority author.”” (346)

“Giving class its due does not, it should be emphasized, reduce the phenomena of race and gender to aspects of class; the point of insisting upon the incommensurability of these categories is only that nothing explains class but class.” (348)

“The dovetail- ing of new forms of historical scholarship with a critique of the canon has produced the quite interesting misapprehension that writing about a given author is equiva- lent to canonization of that author.” (348)

“It is simply taken for granted that any woman writer not currently canonical is ipso facto "lost or undervalued," as though it really did not matter how such texts came to be, or what social condi- tions enabled or constrained the practice of writing for different social groups. 
While I have not undertaken to give a full account in the text of the relation bet- ween the distribution of cultural capital (access to the means ofliterary production) and the position of women in the system of distributions, the lineaments of such an account can be briefly indicated. We might begin by reconsidering two leading questions guiding the current account of women writers in the history of canon for- mation: First, is the fact of the transhistorical oppression of women sufficient to explain the exclusion of women from the means of literary production, if not from the canon itself? And second, does this fact imply that such oppression operates autonomously from class structure? Fortunately history does not enjoin upon us any choice between a transhistorical sexism and a historical class analysis. A prop- erly historical question would be: What determines women's access or lack of ac- cess to the means of literary production at any given historical moment? While transhistorical sexism always makes women available to occupy disadvantaged lo- cations in the social order, it is only the historical class system which determines how they will be so disadvantaged. In the premodern sexual division of labor, women occupy a different site in the system of production than they do after the emergence of generalized commodity production. The same system which "com- modifies" women in new ways also permits them to produce new commodities (such as novels), to become new kinds of cultural producers. The historical class system of capitalism produces a new sexual division of labor, or a rearticulation of transhistorical sexism on the system by which material and cultural capital is dis- tributed.” (349)

“We might also note here that the very American style of liberal pluralist critique has made the entire debate about the canon seem rather mystifying to European critics. See, for example, AliceJardine's and Anne Menke's interviews with fourteen French feminists in a recent issue of Yale French Studies 75 (1988). Jardine and Menke discovered to their surprise that French feminist writers found it difficult to become exercised over the problem of the canon, and that they were even incredu- lous that it had become a feminist issue in America: "It was hard for us to under- stand how so many could profess indifference to inclusion of their own work in the canon. And inclusion was not the only problem: for many of these women the word 'canon' does not refer to the literary tradition, and few of them see it as an area of feminist concern" (230). Here, to cite one response, are Monique Wittig's remarks, which are not untypical: "To say that writers have been excluded from the canon because they are women seems to me not only inexact, but the very idea proceeds from a trend toward theories of victimization. There are few great writers in any century. Each time there was one, not only was she welcome within the canon, but she was acclaimed, applauded, and praised in her time-sometimes especially be- cause she was a woman. I'm thinking of Sand and Colette. I do not think that real innovators have been passed by. In the university, we ruin the purpose of what we do if we make a special category for women-especially when teaching. When we do that as feminists, we ourselves turn the canon into a male edifice" (257).” (352)

“Commenting in an interview about the experience of editing the Norton An- thology o f Afro-American Literature, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., points to the differ- ence between a research program and the exercise of judgment in an institutional context: "When I was in grad school in the 1960s everything black that could be found was reproduced. But some of it was terrible. We've got to make discrimina- tions within the corpus of black literature, and to keep that which is worth keep- ing." These remarks are reproduced in Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education, p. 172.” (352)

“It is perhaps time to recognize that it is only the emergence in our own time of social identity as a positive criterion of judgment (as the basis, in Lauter's phrase, of establishing a "more representative and accurate literary canon") that requires a revisionist history in which social identity is the major neg- ative criterion of judgment.” (353)

“In fact there exists a large body of critique on the subject of the curriculum and its function within the educational system, critique of which the canon debate has remained largely oblivious. See, for example, Michael Apple, Teachers and Texts: A Political Economy ofClass and Gender Relations in Education (New York: Rout- ledge, 1988), and Michael Apple, ed., Cultural and Economic Reproduction in Ed- ucation: Essays on Class, Ideology and the State (London: Routledge, 1982); or Stanley Aronowitz and Henry Giroux, Education Under Siege: The Conservative, Liberal, and Radical Debate over Schooling (South Hadley: Bergin and Garvey, 1985). These works include extensive bibliographies as well. The absence of ref- erence to such work in the debate about the canon, and indeed the absence of comment about the relation between the university curriculum and the curriculum at lower levels of the system, testifies to how entirely the debate has been conducted in the pedagogic imaginary of university teachers. On the actual state of the public school system in the U.S., see Jonathan Kozol's vivid account, Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools (New York: Harper, 1991).” (354)

“See the entry for "culture" in Raymond Williams's Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, revised edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976.1983),87-93,foralucidaccountofwhatisatstakeinthedifferentmeaningsof "culture" historically. We might sum up the difference between our national culture and our school culture by acknowledging that for national culture "Nike" is the name of an athletic shoe, for school culture a Greek goddess.” (354)

“Bourdieu, "Systems of Education and Systems of Thought": "Because of its own inertia, the school carries along categories and patterns of thought belonging to different ages. In the observance of the rules of the dissertation in three points, for example, French schoolchildren are still contemporaries of Saint Thomas. The feel- ing of the 'unity of European culture' is probably due to the fact that the school brings together and reconciles-as it must for the purposes of teaching-types of thought belonging to very different periods" (352). What I have been calling a "text tradition" is obviously the site of critical judgment, in the sense that the entire do- main of intertextu~,lity, or response to earlier by later writers, is a powerful agency for the preservation of these writers. Nevertheless I have consistently argued for locating the site of canon formation in the school, for the reason implied by Bourdieu in the passage just quoted. The point of the sociological argument, for both Bourdieu and myself, is that authors learn whom to read and how to judge in the schools, and that even the judgment of recent but uncanonized work must even- / tually be validated in the passage of writers into school curricula in order for one to speak of canonicity. One should not forget that literary history is filled with the names of writers whose high standing with other, more famous authors was still insufficient to insure their canonicity.” (355-356)

“Alvin W. Gouldner, The Future ofIntellectuals and the Rise ofthe New Class, 21. Gouldner argues persuasively that" An investment in education is not simply a consumable. Something is left over, which produces a subsequent flow of income. It is cultural capital, the economic basis of the New Class" (27). On the other hand, I am not convinced that the problem-solving orientation of the New Class consti- tutes what Gouldner calls a "culture of critical discourse." This is not to say that the professional-managerial class has not produced some forms of social criticism-it has-but that this criticism is seldom systemic (it is usually anti-state but not anti- capital). I am also aware that arguments against systemic critique have been made on certain "post-Marxist" grounds. Foucault's concept of the "specific intellec- tual" might in this context be compared to Gouldner's concept of the New Class intellectual. My own argument follows Bourdieu, however, in his version of sys- temic critique.” (356)

“An example: If the sheer formal atavism of an institution such as the church suits the function of social reproduction, the prestige deriving from its atavistic fea- tures can as well become the ground of resistance in a complex agonistic game re- quiring the expenditure of that prestige as cultural capital. Consider the fate of the Sanctuary movement in the mid-1980s: This movement staged the literalization of the church's institutional autonomy as the autonomy of its physical space, the imaginary "sanctuary" within which political refugees from the right-wing Latin American dictatorships could take sanctuary. Before such an elegant atavism, even our authoritarian state paused, though not for long.” (357)

Viswanathan tends to date the for- mation of the English vernacular canon somewhat later than 1 do, but we share some assumptions about the nationalist motives which are in part the support of the school system and of the imperialist project.” (360)

“The implications of this fact within the developing discourses of Romanticism have been summarized most astutely by Michel Beaujour in an essay entitled "Ge- nus Universum," Glyph 7 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980): "If this segregation [of scripture from other forms of writing] corresponds but imper- fectly to the distinction between the uses of Latin and the Vulgar tongues in medi- eval culture, it seems clear that the coexistence of a priestly tongue and various lay languages resulted in the institutionalization of a dichotomy: it is no accident there- fore that the post-Romantic period attempted to re-instate this duality within var- ious vulgar literatures in order to counteract the tendency to homogenization and equality that accompanies the removal of a sacred hierarchical principle, and the fading away of a hieratic language used at the top (and beyond the top) of the scale" (18). The "re-instatement" took the now familiar but little understood form of a supposed transcendence of genre by truly "literary" works; these works form the super-genre or genus universum of literature itself. “ (360)

            <Title>these are all databases</Title>
            <Text>The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)

What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.
A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.
Another approach is to ignore the categories and use things like topic modelling; relies on a more intimate knowledge of the information being studies (i.e., humanities expertise)</Text>

            <Title>why Guillory matters to me</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation takes “the literary canon” as its primary urgent problem. “The Digital Humanities” often presents itself as a solution to, or a way to sidestep, the presumed exclusionist logic of “the literary canon.”

Like Guillory, I reject the ‘exclusion hypothesis’ of explaining canon formation.
“...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon.” (16)
“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The "means" in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)

DH scholars often call for a reconception of the object of literary study, or of the category of ‘literature’ — I agree, but want to do this in a way that focalizes class, as Guillory does
“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)
This is why DH scholars thing DH can ‘solve’ literary canons, but also how DH can fail: “The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)

Technical literacy can be its own barrier. But honestly, this is just still true about schools, and still important/relevant. The “public humanities” can be viewed with suspicion, as perhaps unscholarly or dangerous, because they try to make literature easy/accessible
“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education … as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (329-330)
"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction.” (340) — if a ‘canonical’ work is experienced as pleasurable this challenges the paradigm

I use the 1790s to figure out this stuff because the 1790s have a LOT of canon-related baggage, as Guillory focalizes
“the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel. Wordsworth and Coleridge responded to this crisis with a programmatic attempt to reaffirm the High Cultural status of traditional canonical works in English against, on the one hand, popular novels and narrative poetry, and, on the other, the quasi-Latinate "poetic diction" supposed to have characterized especially the work of Gray. The effect of that program, which was of course shared by a literary culture much larger than the circle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was to reserve the term "literature" for High Canonical works, and in this way to maintain the cultural capital of those works.”” (Xi)

I… think I reject the concept of ‘the literary’?
“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)

I bring Guillory’s mode of analysis into the digital age by exploring how ‘access’ has continued to be, in altered form, the ‘logic’ of literary debates. DH’s utopian drive comes from the idea of universalizing access, providing the real change in material circumstances that Guillory says is needed. Our limitations come from the way that we limit access in different places, now.
Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (Qtd in Guillory 339-340)
	⁃	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)

I agree with Guillory about the “crisis of the humanities”. DH promises to save the humanities by rescuing its market value, by aligning it with marketable technical skills. This might work but also I HATE it.
“The professional-managerial class has made the correct assessment that, so far as its future profit is concerned, the reading of great works is not worth the investment of very much time or money. The perceived devaluation of the humanities curriculum is in reality a decline in its market value." (46)

            <Text>Mary Robinson’s early biography shares striking resonances with that of Charlotte Smith. Robinson was also married at the age of sixteen to a man who squandered his income. Robinson spent more than a year in King’s Bench debtors’ prison with her husband and infant daughter, from 1774 to 1775, from which she published her first volume of poetry. Rather than immediately taking up the mantle of a professional author, however, in 1776 she became an actress. As an actress, she met increasing success for four seasons — so much so that she attracted the attention in 1779 of the 17-year-old Prince of Wales, who determined to make her his mistress. After a period of semi-public flirtation, Robinson agreed, and retired from the stage. “Although the affair lasted less than a year, 'the Perdita' was notorious from then on; her gowns, her carriages, and her alliances became a constant source of discussion and speculation in the newspapers” (Mark Ockerbloom). The Prince of Wales had given her a bond of £20,000 at the start of their relationship, but when their relationship soon ended, he refused to pay. “She demanded £25,000 for the return of the prince's letters. She apparently settled for £5,000, paid by George III ‘to get my son out of this shameful scrape.’ It was enough to stave off her creditors. In 1782, Mary obtained a further £500 annuity for herself, and a £200 annuity during the life of Maria Elizabeth, in return for the surrender of the Prince's bond.” (Mark Ockerbloom). Robinson continued to live in high society and the public eye, involved with Lord Malden, and then with Colonel Banastre Tarleton in a relationship which would be her longest. In 1783, Tarleton’s debts grew pressing, and his family attempted to sever his relationship with Robinson by promising to pay them if he moved to France without her. He left England in July 1783. Robinson, pregnant, borrowed money for his debts and set out alone to intercept him in Dover. The rough travel led to a miscarriage, the mistreatment of which ultimately paralyzed Robinson’s legs and left her with acutely painful rheumatism the rest of her life. For the next five years, Tarleton and Robinson lived variously in France, Germany, and England, variously together and apart. In 1788, Tarleton’s fortunes and Robinson’s health had recovered enough for her to move permanently back to England, and the two established neighbouring households on Clarges Street in London. Over the next decade, they continued their relationship, while Tarleton’s political career and Robinson’s literary one both flourished. In 1797, Tarleton ended the relationship, and in 1798 married a young heiress, to Robinson’s dismay. Her health worsened, and she died 26 December 1800, aged 43.</Text>

            <Text>Gothic and Romantic engagements he critical reception of Ann Radcliffe, 1789–1850 
Dale Townshend and Angela Wright 

“the numerous obituaries published in Britain in the months following the writer’s death indicate the considerable esteem in which Ann Radcliffe was held in 1823, a fact that seems all the more remarkable in view of the twenty-six years of creative silence that had prevailed since the publication of her fifth novel” (3)

Mingled with Scott even in her reclusiveness: “The Edinburgh Review in May 1823 seized the opportunity occasioned by Radcliffe’s recent demise in order to pay touching tribute to the writer in an extended footnote: ‘The fair authoress kept herself almost as much incognito as the Author of Waverley’” (Townshend and Wright 3)

“he nonetheless takes care to defend the unquestionable genius of Ann Radcliffe on at least three accounts: her presiding over ‘a separate and distinct species of writing’ (Scott 1824: xx); her ability to sustain her readers’ interest and attention across three major novels … / … and her exploration of extreme human passions in appropriately southern European settings” (Townshend and Wright 5-6)

“In the twenty-six years between the publication of he Italian and her death in early 1823, Ann Radcliffe entered what, for many of her readers and critics, was a profound and enduring creative interregnum. hough it was partially broken by the unauthorised publication of Poems by Mrs Ann Radcliffe in 1816, the material contained therein was largely an anthologisa- tion of most (but not all) of the poetry that had already been published in Athlin and Dunbayne, A Sicilian Romance, he Romance of the Forest and Udolpho and thus not, in effect, a new production by the author’s pen at all.” (Townshend and Wright 13)

“Irrespective of the various ways in which she was aligned with cultural heritage, that Ann Radcliffe even figured in a line of otherwise exclusively male writers was, in itself, both significant and extraordinary, for, since its inception in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the discourse of original genius had primarily served as a category somewhat narrowly reserved for men.” (Townshend and Wright 18)</Text>

            <Title>literary celebrity can inhibit legacy</Title>
            <Text>I… think I am actually interested in the role of “celebrity” as related to authors, and the observation that too much / the wrong kind of celebrity during an author’s lifetime counteracts the potential for long-lasting literary fame
though, Radcliffe was also like Austen quite reclusive and resistant to the “celebrity author” role, even after she achieved financial literary success
but, that just meant that salacious stories of her Gothic madness &amp; death circulated unchallenged after she stopped writing and scholars are still trying to figure out what really did happen to her
hmm-- it ties into my general interest of trying to pick my way through my decade of choice, trying on a range of different metrics for “important” and then paying attention to the bodies of texts that come forward as “important” for each metric
and my diss authors (other than Radcliffe) are all attempting to use and cultivate literary fame as one of the ends of their writing
(well, even Radcliffe is cultivating fame, but with less directly political ends)
I picked authors who wrote prolifically in a range of mediums and genres because I am interested in the emerging “reading public” and what it looked like in the 1790s when all that writing and reading got very high-stakes</Text>

            <Title>Scheuermann  - Hannah More and the English Poor </Title>
            <Text>Scheuermann  - Hannah More and the English Poor (2001)
The problem with More is that while she is a most interesting figure, her ideas are largely repugnant to modern sensibilities. Critics often deal with this inconvenience either by apologizing for their subject or by changing what she says so that she seems closer to us in spirit. But although More’s position on social issues is not in harmony with ours, it is entirely representative of her own times. Her full welcome into the most influen- tial circles—she was a Bluestocking and an intimate of Samuel Johnson and his friends—points to this acceptance by her peers. The extraordi- nary sales of her Cheap Repository Tracts attest to the chord she struck in her own society. And when we look at eighteenth-century laws regarding the poor, and contemporary commentary on those Poor Laws, we under- stand just how accurately More reflects the spirit of her time. (237)
More’s most recent biographer, Patricia Demers, makes a charmingly earnest effort “to deal justly with Hannah More,” although that “means admitting both the expansiveness and the limitations of her charity, methodology, and vision.”1 She worries about “how to accord justice” to this woman “who is—and, as some would argue, always was—so devastatingly out of step.... More’s central belief in a natural hierarchical social order...is now angering in its condescension and immobility” (p. 2). More’s work “is now widely assumed to have been a narrow exercise of knowing and keep- / ing one’s place” (p. 11); this line is particularly irritating to feminists: “Feminist criticism has been understandably and rightly severe about More’s dedication to the doctrine of the two spheres and her solemn dis- courses on submission” (p. 21). Gamely, Demers insists that More “is altogether more complex and conflicted than most detracting comments or piecemeal excerpts indicate” (p. 22). Mitzi Myers, delighted to have found a female eighteenth-century writer who was clearly successful, largely re-writes More so that her “didactic” works “scarcely stand second to the canonical novel in interest and importance” in terms of “what they reveal about women.”2 More becomes “a pioneer social novelist” (p. 267), although Myers is talking about short tales. Ignoring entirely the form More used for the tracts, Myers insists that “Transcribing her society’s exigent problems into fiction, More helped give the novel a new seriousness, relevance, and direction” (p. 267). More’s tales, designed to teach the poor to be satisfied with their lot in life and those better off how to help the poor without raising them too much, become in Myers’ reading (237-8)
fresh literary analogues of urgent social awareness; her thematic message of domestic heroism occasions a new domestic realism, ideas and aesthetics are generated from the woman novelist’s characteristic stance. In its complex mix of literary and cultural innovation, More’s Repository illustrates how women’s educative and caretaking role fed into new strains of social fiction, and her work exemplifies how women could translate female ideology’s didactic imperative into an authoritative voice capable of documenting and interpreting historical realities. (p. 268) (238)
Other recent readers fall somewhere between Myers’ and Demers’ readings; Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace, for example, presents a rather strange More who, along with sister Patti, has a morbid response to the physical nature of the poor; much of Kowaleski-Wallace’s discussion centers on “the ‘grotesque’ body” and More’s presumed need to tame it, especially in the poor. In other words, Kowaleski-Wallace, like Myers, reshapes a More who fits her own interests. The very title of her book, in fact, suggests a biased reading: Their Fathers’ Daughters: Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, and Patriarchal Complicity.3 (238)
So the More that contemporary critics discuss is troubling and, in Kowaleski-Wallace’s case, troubled. What we don’t get is much of an eighteenth-century More, and before I get to my own discussion of More’s work—my own discomfort with More’s perspectives apparent at many points—I want to present a context for her ideas by looking first at some aspects of the eighteenth-century’s Poor Laws.  (238)
“More’s assumptions here are central to her view of the compact between rich and poor. If the rich do choose to help the poor, their aid is strictly a matter of voluntary charity. That “kindness” is drawn forth by their own sense of the deserving nature of the individual case.” (246)

            <Title>Cronin, Politics of Romantic Poetry</Title>
            <Text>Good lit review. Major monographs: Marilyn Butler’s Romantics, Rebels, and Reactionaries; Jerome McGann’s The Romantic Ideology. Revised by Clifford Siskin, The History of Romantic Discourse.
“Butler and McGann share an ambition to ‘historicize’ Romanticism, and both assume that to historicize is also to politicize. Butler’s account is admirable in its directness and clarity, but its virtues are expensively purchased by maintaining a system of values which, if consistently applied, would support the view that Erasmus Darwin is a better poet than Wordsworth. McGann, by comparison, adopts values which are certainly flexible enough to avoid any such uncomfortable consequence, but he achieved his flexibility only at the risk of inconsistency.” (9)
Siskin is very into sonnets, which I like.
“Butler, McGann, and Siskin… tend to the view that all poetry is political, because, to put it more crudely than any of them would agree to, to write a non-political poem is itself a political act, something like abstaining in a General Election.” (12) “On the face of it, this could be true only if the field of politics were coextensive with reality, and there are some who have argued quite persuasively that this is indeed effectively the case, for in writing reality cannot be encountered, but only represented, and any representation of reality might be said to serve political ends.” (12)
“the kind of political poetry with which I will be concerned, poetry that speaks to a divided society in an attempt to constitute its readers as citizens of what Hill calls, remembering a passage from Hopkins, the just kingdom, and that I prefer to nominate in an echo of Wordsworth ‘the pure commonwealth’. … This will be a book committed to the notion that the political import of a poem is a function of its style quite as much as of its sentiments, and that a poet’s most effective political act is the forging of a new language.” (13)

“It may be that Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads affiliates his own verse with the oral tradition of popular ballads that might seem the best recourse for a poet dedicated to the ‘principle of equality’, but it would be hard to claim that Wordsworth’s poems show a knowledge of that tradition equal to Walter Scott’s, nor that they were so deeply influenced by it, nor that they succeeded in addressing so wide an audience, and no one would claim either that Scott’s Muse was a levelling one, or that Scott developed a poetic style, whatever the claims Lukacs has made for the novels, that expressed the principles of the French Revolution.” (16)  “There is no simple equivalence that allows us to judge the relative radicalism of a text by the width of the readership it addresses… Simpson’s book, for example, is lucid, vigorously written, and free from forbidding jargon, but one would have to accept, surely, that its idiom excluded from its readership the great bulk of ‘ordinary men and women’, and it does not follow from this that Simpson’s politics are latently conservative.” (16)

Summary of book:
“Like Butler and McGann, I will divide the Romantic period into three phases: the early period dominates by the Revolution and the Revolutionary war, the time when, as Wordsworth recalled, he and many of his fellow poets found themselves in support of their country’s ‘nominal enemies’; the period of the Napoleonic wars when Britain was in danger of defeat, even invasion; and the immediately post-war period, dominated in Britain by popular unrest. In each case my purpose will be, not to offer a survey of poetry written in the period, but to identify a dominant discourse, and to analyze its limitations.” (16)
“The first period is characterized by the attempt to frame a universal language, a language in which it might be possible to address all of humanity. The most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status was the language of science, and hence it is appropriate that the most celebrated poet of these years, Erasmus Darwin, was concerned ‘to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science’. The language framed by Darwin justifies its claim to universality, in part, by rejecting supernatural in favour of natural explanations of phenomena, that is, by excluding religion. Given that differences of religious belief were among the most powerful forces of division in his world, his tactic is entirely logical, but it results in a paradox. Darwin framed a languages that addresses all of humanity only by rigorously excluding the large majority of human individuals / who were united in their possession of a religious faith, however much they may have been divided by the faiths that they professed. Darwin’s poetry forces one to the conclusion that a universal language may be among the more exclusive idioms available to a poet. I turn then, as a counter to Darwin, to his most talented illustrator, William Blake, who in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell framed a language designed to reconcile the kind of intellectual radicalism shared by Dawin, Priestley and the rest of the literary set that gathered around the publisher Joseph Johnson with the radicalism of the streets, which was apt to express itself in the mode of Biblical prophecy, and to flaunt its own outrageous credulity as a flamboyant rejection of godless common sense. In The Marriage of Heaven and Hell the attempt to produce a work that could be read by all of Blake’s fellow-radicals results, and count only result, in a text remarkable for its massive idiosyncracy. Finally, I turn to Southey and Landor, who courageously continues to write an international poetry at a time when the nations were at war. In them, the attempt to devise a universal language assumes its latest guise: it becomes the mark of the traitor.” (16-7)
“The book’s second part begins with Walter Scott, for Scott, like Erasmus Darwin before him, framed most powerfully the language of the new period, which was not a language designed to unite all mankind but to unite the nation in its war against the French. But all Scott’s poems are set in the past. … no description of Scott’s Britain could avoid encountering the economic, geographical, and political differences that divided the kingdom, a fact which emerges with some clarity when I turn to Wordsworth’s Poems in Two Volumes, a collection which attempted to resolve the differences of his fellow citizens, and succeeded only in provoking a hostility so intense that Wordsworth was deterred from publishing his poems for some years. This section ends with another paradox, the emergence at the very end of the war years of a new poet to usurp Scott’s place as … the chief poet of the nation. It was a station that Byron earned by systematically and flamboyantly refusing any suprapersonal loyalty.” (17)
“The book’s third part is concerned with the post-war years, when the conflict between nations was supplanted by an internal conflict between classes. In the work by Byron and Shelley discussed there the poetic identity that the two poets had chosen as ‘genteel reformers’ becomes itself problematic, with the consequence that, as both recognize, poetic style could no longer disengage itself from class conflict. The book ends / with the Cockney poets, with Leigh Hunt and Keats, who cannot find, any more that Byron or Shelley, a poetic language that subsumes class difference, but who devise a language in which those differences may be uncomfortably contained.” (17-8)
“In his great preface Wordsworth defines the poet as ‘a man speaking to men’. It is the project that unites all the poets that appear in this book, and it is a project in which all of them failed, and not simply because they neglected to address women. They failed because they wrote at a time when there was no language aailable that could address itself to the ‘one human heart’ that they were confident all of us share. This book charts that failure in each of its three phases, each of them presided over, perhaps, by a single iconic figure. Presiding over the first phase is Anarcharsis Cloots, so touchingly dedicated to universal revolution that he once confessed his ambition to establish a republic on the moon, and so confident of the universal power of his own rhetoric that he designated himself ‘Orator of the Human Race’. Nelson presides over the second phase, at the moment when he ordered the signal flags raised before the Battle of Trafalgar, conscious that, despite all his personal peculiarities, at this moment he speaks for ‘England’. The characteristic figure of the third phase is ‘Orator’ Hunt, ‘Bristol’ Hunt, or simply Henry, ascending the platform to make his speech to the thousands gathered at St Peter’s ield in Manchester, recognizable to everyone by virture of his trademark white top hat. That speech was never made, but was forestalled by a cavalry charge by the local militia, a graphic enough demonstration that in 1819 the language that spoke to one section of the population instilled in another only a fierce desire that it should be silenced.” (18)

Section One
Introduction
“the poem never seems confident of whom it is addressing” (24) on Coleridge’s “Religious Musings”
“Its hesitation summarize those of a decade in which poets tried to locate some commanding position from which they could survey the political turmoil through which they were living, only to find that the prophetic voice, the voice removed from time, was unavailable to them, and a decade in which they tried to locate a voice that could harmonize, like Coleridge’s ‘glad stream’, the diverse and contradictory currents that together constituted the English radical tradition only to find that no such voice was available.” (28)

Chapter 1: Erasmus Darwin: From the Bastille to Birmingham
“Erasmus Darwin was the most popular poet of the 1790s, and his The Botanic Garden (1791), in which The Economy of Vegetation formed the first part, and The Loves of Plants (1789) the second, was the decade’s most popular poem.” (29) “The beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden published by Joseph Johnson in 1791, with its elegant typefaces, and its engravings from Fuseli and others, in itself proclaims a confidence in the book’s unusual importance. … His edition of Darwin’s poem registers his recognition of the book’s commercial prospects but also his recognition that the poem gave vivid expression to a set of / beliefs shared by Johnson’s stable of authors, and his confidence that in 1791 such beliefs could be expressed triumphally, by the publication of a volume as costly and elegant as one of Wedgwood’s copies of the Portland Vase, itself reproduced by Blake in the book’s most elaborate engraving.” (29-30)
P. 39-40 — Darwin uses poetry as sugar to make the medicine of rational essays/footnotes go down more smoothly
P. 45 - Darwin’s poem leaves out the very poor, who riot in 1791 and damage property of Priestly, who wants to enfranchise them
“It was not Erasmus Darwin who developed a poetry that could speak to, and out of, the popular radicalism of the 1790s, but the most inventive of his illustrators, William Blake” (47)

Chapter 2: Williams Blake and Revolutionary Prophecy
“The central difficulty of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is the problem of who it was written for.” (48) - a takedown of a Swedenbog piece written for the Johnson circle?
“Throughout the period treated in this book successive governments made a more sustained and vigorous attempt to prevent the publication of Paine’s writings than those of any other radical propagandist, and the reason is obvious enough. They correctly detected in Tom Paine’s prose the achievement of the alliance between intellectual and popular radicalism that they most feared. Their campaign was strikingly unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent Paine’s works becoming more widely available through cheap reprints than the works of any other contemporary writer, and yet the consequence they feared never came to pass.” (59)
“But it would be idle to deny that it remains for all that an entirely eccentric text. Up to a point Blake’s printing methods in themselves account for this. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell exists in nine complete and two incomplete copies, and it seems improbable that very many more copies were ever produced. The contrast with the thousands of copies circulating of Paine’s Rights of Man needs no underlining. But it would be idle to pretend that the Marriage, even if Blake had devised a way of printing that made possible a wide circulation, would ever have achieved wide popularity, and this was not because Blake as an eccentric, but because his project was.” (60) “in making such an attempt Blake is likely to succeed only in writing the manifesto of a party of which he is the only member” (60)

Chapter 3: The English Jacobins
“1798 was the year of The Anti-Jacobin. In its first incarnation, as a weekly review, it survived for only 37 issues, but by 9 July 1798, when the last of these appeared, its work was done.” (61)
“The Anti-Jacobin succeeded by being more Jacobinical than its enemies, by being itself so uncompromising that it successfully forced compromise on its opponents. The Jacobin was established as a compound beast, made up of impiety, lack of patriotism, profligacy, sentimentality, inhuman rationality, murderous violence, a character so Protean, adepts at assuming so many disguises, that it seemed monstrous even to the ‘Jacbobins’ themselves.” (69)
“Only two substantial Jacobin poems were published in 1798. One of them was Southey’s second edition of Joan of Arc, the other a poem of which Southey was the first and greatest admirer, Landor’s Gebir.” (74)
“Landor found the story of his poem in a translation from the French by Clara Reeves, ‘The History of Charoba, Queen of Egypt’, appended to her The Progress of Romance, a lengthy dialogue in which a pair of learned ladies defend, to the astonished admiration of their male adversary,the claim that prose fiction, the romance, should be granted a status equal to that of epic poetry. Landor, he tells us, came across the book ‘on the shelf of a circulating library’, and he affects a loftily dismissive response to it… But there is reason for suspecting that he was more receptive to Reeves’s argument than he finds it politic to admit.” (74)
“It is a Jacobin vision, and it concludes the last Jacobin poem to be published in England until Shelley was to reinvent a modified version of the kind some fifteen years later. Gebir is Jacobin in its internationalism, in a geographical sweep that takes the poem from the Iberian peninsula to Egypt, and then to the new western world, presumably America… it is Jacobin, too, in employing this internationalist rhetoric to articulate a condemnation of Britain in its war against France. It is Jacobin in its contempt of / royalty, in its fierce anti-militarism, and in maintaining the myth of an original, natural state of peaceful plenty, the birthright of all, until mankind was cheated of it by the machinations of warmongering kings. It it Jacobin in its distrust of the recalcitant prejudices of the ‘vulgar’, and in its desire to redraw the boundaries both of gender and of  genre. But by 1798 it was already a Jacobin poem written out of its time, and it carries the marks of its belatedness.” (79-80) “In part the poem suffers simply from the accident of its timing. It was unlucky to publish a poem that figured the English war against France by an Iberian invasion of Egypt at a time when Napoleon was about to sail for Egypt at the head of his army of occupation.” (80)
“The brave ambition of Jacobin poetry is to escape from history, like the French revolutionaries to rewrite the calendar so that time might begin again, all the distinctions that deformed the old world obliterated” (81)

Section Two
Chapter 4: Walter Scott and Anti-Gallican Minstrelsy
“Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means — the original two volumes of the Minstrelsy sold for a guinea. James Ballantyne’s printing of the volumes works in tandem with Scott’s editorial work to secure this effect. Typefaces elegantly distinguish the ballads from their editorial matter, and the ballads themselves are displayed with an opulent disregard for economy, no more than eighteen lines to the page, so that the 134 lines of ‘Johnnie Armstrong’ occupy eight pages of the first volume.” (94)
“By the time that Scott began to write the economic intregration of Scotland and England was well advanced. The publication history of Marmion itself serves to indicate this.” (105)

Funny quips
“Anyone offering yet another book on the politics of Romantic poetry might reasonably be asked to present a fairly convincing excuse.” (2)
“But then we read that Wordswoth’s ‘secondary’ period is ‘brief to the point of / non-existence’, because, at the date when Wordsworth ought to have begun writing secondary poems, 1808, he started to write bad poems instead.” (7-8)
“It is [Erasmus] Darwin’s treatment of gender and of sexuality that is most distinctive in his verse. His enthusiasm for breast-feeding is predictable enough, as is his hostility to mothers who are ‘bless’d in vain with timid bosoms’, and respond to the ‘tender wailings’ of their infants with ‘unfeeling ear’.” (36)</Text>

            <Title>print culture proof of Locke's importance</Title>
            <Text>It is clear that in the first decade of the eighteenth century ‘Locke on government’ did in fact achieve distinctive status. In 1703 Leslie was provoked to his assault by the reputation of ‘the great L—k’ who, dangerously, ‘makes the consent of every individual necessary’ (RLP, ii, p. 62). In 1709 a cartoon depicted the Whig polemi- cist Benjamin Hoadly at his writing desk with ‘Locke on government’ on his bookshelf. By 1716 the Two Treatises was quoted in parliament. Locke’s influence was facilitated by informal means of transmission. The anonymous Vox Populi, Vox Dei (1709) was a bestselling anthology comprising extracts from Whig-approved texts, including the Two Treatises. Extracts from the Two Treatises also appeared in John Toland’s Anglia Libera (1701) and else- where. Some early readers of the Two Treatises saw it as a handbook for political education, designed to wean the gentry elite from the dangerous (and largely clerical) absurdities of pre-Revolution doctrine. It represented a guide to ‘polite’ citizenship, free of the sycophantic dogmas of absolutist Court society. This role is explicit in William Atwood’s Fundamental Consti- tution of the English Government (1690) which urged that people should ‘take every morning some pages of the Two Treatises of Government, for an effec- tual catholicon against nonsense and absurdities’ (RLP, i, p. 39). The Two Treatises continued to be an instrument of instruction against the follies of the ‘divine right of kings’ in Hoadly’s works and in John Shute Barrington’s The Revolution and Anti-Revolution Principles Stated (1714).

            <Text>Hannah More’s Art of Reduction 
Andrew Heisel 
abstract 
Hannah More is widely viewed as a major figure in the rise of evangelicalism, but how she played her role is still in doubt. She can be read as a conservative interested in maintaining social hierarchy or even as a radical who levels social strata by insisting that only spiritual classifications are important. An underlying network of theological uncertainties in More’s writ- ing creates this divide in the criticism of her work. More insists on the plainness of the Bible, but, since readers nonetheless err, she suggests its plainness must first be matched in the reader in order for the text to be understood. She contradictorily indicates that the Bible or morally sound fictional works may improve the reader and that readers must already be purified before a text can have saving effects. On the one hand, this theological ambiguity can be liberating. On the other hand, the Pauline universalizing rhetoric on which More relies, rather than having the salutary impact recently described by philosophers Giorgio Agamben and Alain Badiou, creates a constant interrogation of self and others in order to reduce individual particularity. More’s fiction continually figures forth the need for an “annihilation of the self” that is to be admired for its saving power and yet also pitied for the suffering it creates—suffering which is the vehicle of both that annihilation and attendant salvation.

            <Text>My ECCO metadata presented particular challenges. I had access to MARC records, which stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue. At several points, I read this data with my feeble non-machine eyes in order to guide my data processing. Using MarcEdit, I converted these MARC records to csv files which could, on OpenRefine, be read, manipulated, and merged like my other corpora. Since I was not able to simply convert “all the MARC headings that exist” using MarcEdit, I used all numbers 1 to 999 and [will] delete empty columns.
ECCO encodes much of its data in “unassigned” columns, rather than the standardized LOC categories.

            <Text>My fourth chapter turns its attention to the radical press. It will use social network graphs of writers and printers to study the personal connections making up this underground print culture. (Look for political clusters in graphs, and printing circles / overlapping circles)
Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft &amp; Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these texts? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Authors choosing publishers strategically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?

            <Title>ch 1 - what's not novels?</Title>
            <Text>Chapter one takes up the eternal problem of archival gaps, and asks how we might interrogate or fill these gaps with computational methods. It asks how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to fascimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disaparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.
Current materials acquired include:
	•	51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue
	•	42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online

p.559: n analysis of the most performed plays of the decade reveals that audiences enjoyed complicated plots, comic resolutions, traditional scenes of young love winning out over all odds. This is especially true of the theater up to the Terror; "patriotic entertainments" abound under the Terror, perhaps because so many other plays are prohibited or severely censured. After the Terror, for the last five years of the decade, the notion of good and bad revolutions is born, the Terror being in the latter category and seen as an aberration. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.559: informative chapters on the creation and evolution of genres (in particular, mixed genres, melodramas, and the like) -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.560: the ratio of comedies to tragedies performed was an astonishing 14 to 1 -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.560: We also learn, somewhat to our surprise, that theatergoers even in the darkest days of the Revolution "remained attached to the pre-Revolutionary repertory or that part of the new repertory that mimicked the old" (p. 90), although it must be said that very few indeed of the authors repertoried in the second part of the book are those canonized today. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561:  Racine's position in sixty-first place, with only 298 performances, corroborates the public's preference for comedy over tragedy; and "approved" playwrights of the Revolution also fare poorly: Marie-Joseph Chénier comes in sixty-ninth place, with a total of only 283 performances (sixty two of them for Charles IX), while Jean-Louis Laya's four plays had a mere sixty performances, of which L'Ami des Lois had only eighteen. It is clear that these authors would be even less discussed if earlier critics had had access to the kind of information contained in these pages. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561: very useful and thought-provoking charts showing the top ten plays by year -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018
p.561: A book like this can correct many misconceptions that we have of the theater in Paris during the Revolutionary era; it can lead us to understand more clearly than ever before what people actually wanted to see, and permit us to make reasonable conjectures about why. We can, on account of the mass of easily accessible data now available to us in one place, more fully appreciate what living the Revolution was like for the man (and woman) in the street. -- Highlighted Nov 7, 2018</Text>

            <Title>Facer, Ruth. Bio of Radcliffe</Title>
            <Text>”According to The Edinburgh Review (May 1823), ‘She never appeared in public, nor mingled in private society, but kept herself apart, like the sweet bird that sings its solitary notes, shrouded and unseen’. In fact, so little was known about Radcliffe’s life in the nineteenth century that Christina Rossetti abandoned a projected biography due to a lack of material” (Facer).
“We do know, however, that Ann Ward Radcliffe was born in Holborn, London, on 9 July 1764. She was the only child of William Ward, a haberdasher, and his wife Ann Oates. Her mother was relatively well connected. Oates’s cousin was Sir Richard Jebb, physician to George III, while her brother-in-law, Thomas Bentley, was the partner of Josiah Wedgwood. In 1772, William Ward moved with his wife and young daughter to Bath, where he would manage a china shop partly owned by Wedgwood. The young Ann was reasonably well educated… In 1787 Ann married William Radcliffe, a hardworking Oxford law graduate who became part-editor and owner of The English Chronicle. He often came home late and in order to occupy her time, Radcliffe began to write, reading aloud the lines she had written during the day on his return.”
“The Radcliffes’ marriage, though childless, appears to have been happy. In her Preface to A Journey made in the Summer of 1794 through Holland and the Western Frontiers of Germany (1795) Radcliffe touchingly referred to her husband as her ‘nearest relative and friend’ and acknowledged that the account of the journey had ‘been written so much from their mutual observation, that there would be a deception in permitting the book to appear, without some acknowledgement, which may distinguish it from works entirely her own’. The couple loved travelling together and used some of the money made from the publication of Radcliffe’s novels to finance their trips.”
“Like her novels, Radcliffe’s last years are shrouded in mystery. She was said to be depressed in 1797. By the end of her life, rumours abounded that she had become insane as a result of her Gothic fantasies and had been incarcerated in a Derbyshire asylum. The truth may never be known. Radcliffe had suffered from asthma for the past twelve years and her death on 7 February 1823 may well have been the result of a fatal attack. Talfourd’s Memoir of the Author, undoubtedly written under the instruction of Radcliffe’s husband, categorically denies that she was insane: ‘while some spoke of her as dead, and others represented her as afflicted with mental alienation, she was thankfully enjoying the choicest of blessings of life’. Her doctor issued a statement after her death, maintaining that she was in perfect mental health. Ann Radcliffe was buried in a vault in the Chapel of Ease belonging to St. George’s, Hanover Square, in Bayswater, London.” (Facer)</Text>

            <Text>THE LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF THE ESTC STEPHEN KARIAN 
The English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC) has been described as “one of the greatest scholarly ventures ever conducted” and “the largest humanistic research project of the twentieth century.” Even one of the most trenchant critics of the ESTC’s recent developments is confident that “biblio- graphical and library historians will . . . judge [the ESTC] as one of the heroic scholarly enterprises of the twentieth century.”2 For once, such superlatives are well deserved. As a union catalogue of nearly all printed matter before 1801 published in the British Isles and colonies or written in the English language, the ESTC has transformed eighteenth-century scholarship. It has enabled scholars of this period to imagine and pursue research questions that would otherwise have been extremely difficult if not impossible to answer. For many research projects concerning the English-speaking world before 1801, the ESTC is one of the best resources to identify relevant printed materials, determine their publishing histories, and find out where they can be examined.  (283)
Those responsible for laying the foundations of the ESTC in the 1970s exhibited considerable foresight in their decision not to compile a printed catalogue along the lines of the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640 or Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700. Instead, they chose to exploit the resources of computing power, which meant that ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work. The ESTC was also a remarkable collaborative effort that spanned the Atlantic and encompassed scholars as well as librarians. Visionary thinking was essential to the ESTC’s emergence, and I believe a similar kind of visionary thinking is needed now, especially in anticipation of the needs and goals of twenty-first-century scholarship. (283)

ECCO uses ESTC data for bibliographical information, though many users of ECCO don’t realize the extent to which it depends on the ESTC. Users of ECCO also might not know how many eighteenth-century items it lacks. The ESTC contains over 340,000 eighteenth-century records; ECCO has about 180,000.5 ECCO contains searchable images of the books’ contents, which is especially desired in our search-crazed digital culture. Like ECCO, Google Books has searchable, digitized images, but unlike ECCO, it is free. Google, however, has for some unknown reason neglected to catalogue exactly what was being scanned from books held by the Bodleian Library, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, the New York Public Library, and other libraries. If, therefore, scholars want to know which eighteenth-century editions of Tom Jones appear in Google Books, they had better be prepared to embark on their own bibliographical quest because Google has made no effort to match what it has scanned to standard bibliographical reference tools, including the ESTC. In contrast, ECCO can be directly searched using ESTC numbers, and in the summer of 2011 the ESTC added links to ECCO. Bibliographically minded scholars trying to exploit the great resources of Google Books are currently forced “to tread the dreary paths without a guide.”6  (284)
p.284: So on the one hand, the ESTC has become more widely available and accessible than ever before. On the other hand, it appears to have been superseded by full-text databases, one of which costs a considerable amount of money to access.
Indeed, writing about the ESTC means acknowledging its omissions, errors, and inconsistencies. Many of these problems have been discussed in a series of essays over the last two decades, two of the most detailed of which are by James E. May. May has found many instances in which the ESTC does not identify a book as being a reissue of another edition; such an omission might cause a scholar to assume that the book had not been published before this reissue. He also found many pagination errors, inconsistencies in recording frontispieces, numerous errors in linking individual copies to the appropriate editions, outdated information regarding attribution, unreported copies at libraries that generally reported their holdings to the ESTC, and distinct editions that appear nowhere in the catalogue. His conclusion is a sobering one: “there is a one-in-three or -four likelihood of finding in the ESTC record an error or serious oversight in the description, in the item’s identity relative to other recorded items, or in the copies listed.” (285)
While researching this article, I discovered a small number of errors regarding bibliographical format. Some of these would be amusing to bibliographers, who know that formats such as 3o, 5o, 6o, 7o, and 9o do not exist.8 (All of the errors I found have since been fixed.) Some of these minor mistakes probably resulted from transcription errors (285)
“We spent an awful lot of time recording stuff manually. And for some years we put this all down on sheets of paper and keyed it in later. Because even though the British Library was building machine-readable files, everything was done manually and sent to a typing service and then keyed in by a typing service. That’s why there are so many, there were tens of thousands of errors created by that typing service. They’re still in there; we’re still getting them out.9 “	9.	Daniel J. Slive, “Exit Interview: Henry Snyder,” RBM 2, no. 1 (2001): 73–92, on p. 86. 
“A broken record occurs when information added to a record has not been checked against the copies already listed under that record” (Karian 285)

Tabor’s discussion offers one answer to James May’s pressing question, “Who will edit the ESTC?” The answer seems to be: users will. Now when viewing an ESTC record, users can click on the “Error Report Form” and describe the errors they have noticed. Such reports do in fact generate a helpful and timely response, as I have discovered after making a series of reports that elicited responses from Simon May at the British Library. One hopes that the British Library staff will be able to handle the volume of submitted error reports so that the accuracy and completeness of the ESTC file will continue to improve. But posting these corrections can’t fix the ESTC, because so many errors and inconsistencies pervade the file.  (286) 
Why then did my search using the “Word(s) anywhere” field not find any of these records? 
Upon closer inspection, I saw that all of these records contain references to “not in Foxon” in the Uncontrolled note, which is MARC field 509.12 For the results of my initial search, all the references to “not in Foxon” appeared in the General note (MARC field 500) or Citation/references (MARC field 510), sometimes in addition to the Uncontrolled note. It seems, then, that informa- tion in the Uncontrolled note can be viewed but not searched. I don’t under- stand why this distinction would be made for a freely available online database that is undergoing constant revision. The Uncontrolled note is presumably a field for information that still needs to be verified (the ESTC’s help page does not mention this field at all), but the tentative nature of the information in this field could be indicated and the relevant information should be accessible to users’ searches. As long as information in the Uncon- trolled note is unavailable to searching, users will be prevented from exploring the full resources of the ESTC.13  (287)
“Only a thorough and  / painstaking search through all 1,255 records would reveal exactly how manyof them are Foxon items that do not appear in Foxon. Given that all of thisinformation has already been digitized, conducting such a search is anunnecessary expenditure of scholarly energy” (287-288)
This example demonstrates not only some limitations of the ESTC, but also the existence of two ESTC interfaces, one publicly available with some information visible but not searchable, the other available on a limited basis. This example also reveals a serious inconsistency in the way miscellaneous information has been stored. (288)
To consider fully the limitations and possibilities of the ESTC requires examining it as a database rather than merely as a large-scale online library catalogue. And here is where the ESTC promises to be especially important, given recent interests in using quantitative information to study literary and cultural history. When applied to book production, this approach is sometimes referred to as bibliometric analysis, an approach that should expand our knowledge of publishing history in a way that was previously impossible. These projects may well challenge widely held views that are based more on legend and assumption than on fact. Recent illuminating examples of such approaches include Franco Moretti’s graphical analysis of the rises and falls of the novel in nations throughout the world, David L. Gants’s study of the early seventeenth-century book trade, and Steven N. Zwicker’s exploration of the category of Restoration literature.16 With its extensive collection of data, the ESTC promises to be an essential resource for similar investigations. (289)
However, two key problems with the ESTC’s structure and its data will vex any effort to use the database for such purposes. The first problem relates to the unit of classification. A clearly defined unit is necessary to ensure that a study of change over time is reliable and based on consistent terms. What is the unit that the ESTC uses? Scholars sometimes answer by using the terms “edition,” “issue,” or “title” interchangeably. But since the ESTC does not rely in a consistent manner on any of these terms for its unit of classification, one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC. (289)
An edition (using the bibliographical meaning of an edition) encompasses all copies printed from essentially the same setting of type. An edition of a book may be reissued, perhaps with a new title-page referring to a “second edition” or a “corrected edition.” Despite the claims on the title-page, however, this new “edition” is not a new edition at all if the setting of type has not significantly changed. In these situations, bibliographers would refer to multiple issues of the same edition. A title is an ambiguous and nonbibliographic term, possibly referring to all editions of a particular work (all editions of Hamlet, for example) or to a publication with a specifically phrased title. (289)
For the most part, the ESTC contains a record for each issue (289)
The ESTC’s practice of handling multi-volume sets is highly variable, sometimes assigning one record for an entire set, sometimes one record for each volume, and sometimes for both the set and each volume. Reissues of individual volumes complicate this kind of situation even further. … The ESTC’s somewhat ad hoc method of assigning multiple records in these instances stems from the complexity of the bibliographical situation.17 Anyone who studies early printed books for a brief but intense period will quickly learn that it is no simple matter to untangle the knots of multiple issues and states. In addition, the ESTC’s use of multiple records often assists cataloguers trying to match their holdings to the ESTC. It is much easier to compare a title- page to its ESTC transcription than it is to investigate the history of a work’s multiple editions, issues, and states. But the consequence of this ease of use for cataloguers is that the database cannot serve the interests of certain areas of scholarly inquiry. Because of the highly variable meaning of the term “ESTC record,” the results of any large-scale search cannot be reliably compared to the results of another search.  (290)
“the only way to avoid such a problem with the ESTC in its current form is to check every single record of a search, an astonishingly laborious process.” (291)
And none of this gets us any closer to an appropriate unit of classification. Even if the ESTC used a bibliographically defined “edition” as its unit, a broadsheet would be treated as equivalent to a 1,000-page volume, an equivalence that would usually distort our understanding of publishing trends. One way to avoid using such an equivalence would be to adopt the unit of the “edition sheet” for the number of sheets of paper needed to produce one copy of the edition. Thus a broadsheet would be equivalent to a sixteen- page octavo edition.19 This unit still cannot tell us how many copies of each edition were printed—the evidence for such information is usually lost to us— nor can it tell us how many readers there were for each copy. But it would certainly offer a standard definition that could be used in a comparative manner and allow us at last to compare apples to apples. An ideally con- structed ESTC would be multidimensional in a way that would allow users to select a preferred unit of classification and change it at will. (291)
The second problem with using the ESTC to investigate publishing patterns derives from how it dates books whose imprints lack dates of publication. Dates in an ESTC record appear in two MARC fields: 008 and 260. A search for a particular year will find a record with that year in either of these fields. The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records—for example, everything from 1720—there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720, such as items known to have been published in 1721 before March 25 (those records read “1720 [i.e. 1721]”); items with uncertain dates (namely records dated somewhere around 1720); or items with dates given in a range in which 1720 is on one end of that range. If, therefore, one wants to find the total number of records that can be confidently dated to a particular year, one should expect a degree of overcounting. (291)
The years 1720 and 1730 (and to a somewhat lesser extent 1725) contain more total records than the other years represented in this table, and they also contain significantly more records of uncertain dates. The major fluctuations in this table do not necessarily reveal anything about publishing patterns in this decade, but rather the manner in which ESTC records are dated when their dates of publication are not known: they are assigned to the closest year possible, which often means the year at the nearest five- or ten-year interval (in this respect, the ESTC follows British Library cataloguing rules). Thus any study of changes over time will reveal artificial “peaks” in the data at five- and especially ten-year intervals, which in turn will vitiate efforts to study press production within a narrowly defined window. (292)
Clearly, MARC records were not originally designed for early printed books. Therefore the use of MARC records is an uncomfortable fit with the kinds of items the ESTC catalogues. It seems to me that the only way to improve the ESTC as a database would be to supplement MARC records with another database structure.  (293)

            <Text>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 
I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.</Text>

            <Title>1990s canon debate</Title>
            <Text>In other words, Gamer and Taylor both affirm the key conclusion of John Guillory’s Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation, that “in fact ‘aesthetic value’ is nothing more or other than cultural capital" (332). Guillory’s sociological history of literary canons is a well-established part of literary studies, which will take on new dimensions as I apply to to the current moment of digital databases. In the eighteenth century, he argues, the cultural capital of vernacular English literature is defined by its use within the school system to enable and restrict social mobility. English vernacular literature first begins to accumulate cultural capital in middle-class schools where it is “a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97) that would allow readers to improve and signify their social standing. The public re-assessment of literature described by Gamer and Taylor is, for Guillory, “the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel” (xi), which seem in danger of affording too much social mobility by offering too little literary distinction for social elites. The ‘solution’ is institutionalization, in which “the school becomes the exclusive agent for the dissemination of High Canonical works,” and therefore, he argues, “the prestige of literary works as cultural capital is assessed according to the limit of their dissemination, their relative exclusivity” (133). Under this system, ‘serious’ literature may not be identifiable linguistically, but it can still be identifiable by the difficulty of accessing it. This history of canonization has important implications for the field of literary study. As Guillory himself insists, if the aesthetic value of a text is determined by the social operations of class, it undermines the notion of literature itself as a category of writing distinguishable in aesthetic terms from non-literary writing. Guillory’s book is motivated by the canon debates of the 1990s, which were driven by an urgent re-valuation of literature by women and people of colour. His response insists that it is untenable to conceive of the problem in terms of increasing the ‘representation’ of individual works or authors within existing systems. Instead, for Guillory problem lies in the institutionalization of literature itself. “If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain,” he says, embedding his prescription in that “if,” “it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon” (265). In other words, assigning the cultural capital of “literature” to different works cannot change the underlying system.</Text>
            <Comments>‘Too much’ and ‘too little’ are here, of course, defined from the point of those with cultural capital which they wish to maintain.
Q for Gillespie: should I still research “the new formalist work to reclaim the literary qua the literary - and e.g. Steve Conner's - ‘nah’” ? What is useful/important to address in this work, given what I say here?
Part of Guillory’s argument is that, although the rhetoric of the canon debates generally sought to re-value authors of any number of oppressed categories, often using the phrase “gender, race, and class” as a single unit, the work undertaken was in fact unable to address class, since class operates differently from gender and race.
Do I need to say more about this? I feel like I’ve already spent a long time on Guillory.

Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (Qtd in Guillory 339-340)</Comments>

            <Text>My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair’s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer’s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the “parade of authors” and “parliament of texts” models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the “footprint” left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski’s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “resonance,” which takes Brewer’s “footprint” as the primary object of study to trace the “busy afterlife of the literary artifact” which “refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.” This “busy afterlife” can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work’s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. </Text>

            <Text>In spite of her generosity and dedication, More’s activities as an educator and social worker have been harshly criticized by later writers. In her scholarly 1952 biography Hannah More, the historian M. G. Jones wrote that More’s involvement with the Mendip poor is 
responsible in great part for the unsympathetic portrait of her which has been handed down to posterity. In it she appears as a masterful, dogmatic woman, a high Tory in politics, a rigid Evangelical in reli- gion, using her undeniable talents for organization to dragoon the wretched, ignorant, ill-nourished population into schools which did not attempt to offer opportunity to children and adults to improve their material conditions. (Jones, 152) 
Unable to refute these charges, Jones can offer only the partial excuse that More’s attitudes were typical of her time. Like “the bulk of her contemporaries,” More attributed poverty “to the depravity of [the working] class,” rather than “to the failure of the Great Society to realize its responsibilities. . . . Hannah More reacted to the problem of poverty in a manner characteristic of reformers throughout the eighteenth century. To her the problem was a religious, not an economic one” (Jones, 152–53). (Nardin 268)
Most of the scholars who have followed Jones condemn More in similar terms. She has generally been portrayed as an unbending Burkean conservative, who undertook to educate the lower classes primarily, if not entirely, as a means of indoctrinating them in the principles of social sub- mission. For example, Patricia Demers argues in a recent study that More’s “belief in a natural hierarchical social order,” a belief which Demers finds “angering in its condescension and immobility,” prevented More from doing anything significant to improve conditions among the poor (Demers, 2). Elizabeth Kowaleski-Wallace takes an even darker view of the relationship between More’s Tory convictions and her philanthropic projects. Her 1991 book admits that the More sisters did indeed offer economic aid to their protégés, but argues that their efforts were “controlled by a class politic,” rather than by a genuine desire to relieve suffering /(Kowaleski-Wallace, 72). Though Kowaleski-Wallace acknowledges that “literally” it was “charitable” of the More sisters to distribute “warm clothing” and other material benefits, she unmasks their true motive as the desire “to establish a particular kind of bodily discipline” among the poor by forcing them to dress and behave like members of the middle classes (Kowaleski-Wallace, 68). Like Jones, Demers and Kowaleski-Wallace argue that More’s attitudes were “characteristic” of the period.1 (Nardin 268-9)
There are two problems with these judgments. First, they greatly exaggerate More’s dedication to church and state. Though it is true that the “mainstream” Tory position incorporated constructive criticism of existing institutions within a generally conservative framework, More was angrier and more deeply critical of both church and state than the scholars discussed above allow. And her disaffection increased markedly during the 1790s. Second, these judgments do not relate More’s activities to their historical context in a sufficiently nuanced manner. No “characteristic” or “typical” attitude toward the poor marked the years from 1789 to 1803. An acrimonious debate over the cause and cure of poverty characterized the period, a debate to which More responded in an idiosyncratic manner. As her own views changed, a period of reaction set in, and this conjunction of events prevented her from negotiating a wholly satisfactory public stance. (Nardin 269)
The aim of this essay, then, is to re-examine More’s opinions about poverty, paying particular attention to the contemporary situation and the cross pressures to which it subjected her. I hope to show that, although More was a less enthusiastic believer in the “hierarchical social order” than most scholars have argued, the evasions and compromises she engaged in as a practical reformer helped to damage her reputation with posterity.

            <Text>Reading Feeling, Writing Timeliness:
Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature
To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two contentious elements of literature, the complex and variable interrelationship of which my study foregrounds, are feeling and timeliness. Both concepts shape eighteenth century writing, and my approach to it. “Feeling” as a central idea refers both to the literature of sensibility as an evolving counterpoint to enlightenment rationalism, and to contemporary processes of reparative reading which foreground the limits of scholarly critique. “Timeliness” encompasses both the urgent responses of the eighteenth century mediascape to a perceived historical rupture, and to an exhaustively particular methodology of historicized textual study. Although my project remains quantitative and computational in its technological foundations, my central interest remains with the field of eighteenth century studies, rather than the field of the digital humanities.</Text>

            <Title>Robinson, Nobody</Title>
            <Text>“Mary Robinson (1757?-1800), [1] née Darby, achieved great celebrity during her lifetime as an actress, courtesan, fashion icon, and prolific author of poetry, essays, novels, and plays. Over the past twenty years, her life and work have received fresh attention from scholars and biographers who have become fascinated, as her contemporaries once were, with her dazzling personality, social prowess, thespian skill, and literary artistry. [2] Despite this resurgence in interest, however, relatively little is known about Robinson’s dramas, The Lucky Escape, a Comic Opera (Drury Lane, 1778; never published), Nobody (Drury Lane 1794; never published) and The Sicilian Lover: A Tragedy in Five Acts (never performed; published 1796). [3] Though they comprise an important component of Robinson’s histrionic and literary legacy, they have received less critical attention than her poems, essays, and novels, due in part to academic prejudices and to access issues: Romantic-period plays have traditionally received the short end of the canonical stick, so to speak, and, as a result, Robinson’s contributions to the genre have only ever existed, until just recently, in manuscript or rare book form. [4] Even in the face of these setbacks, Robinson’s dramas are worth investigating because they provide a key to understanding Romantic-period society, the late eighteenth-century stage, contemporary satire, the birth of celebrity culture, and Robinson’s engagement with the theater during and after her acting career, when she took on her new role as a woman of letters. [5]” (Robinson, n. pag.)</Text>

            <Title>micro archives</Title>
            <Text>Smaller collections allow for more scholarly curation, but have corresponding limitations. Whereas the ‘main players’ of the the mega-archives can be easily enumerated, these specialized collections are numerous. Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle (1,950 references to fiction in issues from 1772-1829), the Index to the Lady’s Magazine (14,729 articles from 1770 to 1818), or the Novels Reviewed Database (1,836 reviews from The Critical Review and The Monthly Review, 1790-1820). Feminist scholarship in particular has seen the creation of resources like the Orlando Project, the Chawton House library Novels Online, Northeastern University’s Women Writers Online and UC Davis’s British Women Romantic Poets. The virtue of these collections is that they achieve even greater accuracy and comprehensiveness within their defined scope. The Shelley-Godwin Archive, for example, can reasonably aspire to digitize every known manuscript of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, and to provide these manuscripts in hand-encoded plaintext transcripts. However, as is inevitable, these specialized archives have the vices of their virtues: their specialized focus allows them to adapt precisely to their materials, and their idiosyncratic data structures can rarely be combined with other resources. The William Blake Archive, for example, benefits enormously from designing its archive around the unique images of each page of each copy of each of Blake’s works. But because this approach is so well-suited to Blake, it cannot be applied beyond Blake. Even if the archive’s resources were available for download, they could not be directly compared to materials from another source which does not record its information at such a minute level of detail. As a result, although a great deal of excellent digital scholarship is contained in specialized micro archives, I do not examine them further in this dissertation.</Text>

            <Title>research methods for corpora comparisons</Title>
            <Text>My biggest-scale question is: I have all of these different corpora of stuff from 1789-99. How can I compare what they contain? If people only worked with the absolute easiest corpus to access (ECCO-TCP), what would they be leaving out?

I want to develop a consistent ontology (in the computer science definition of the word) to apply to all of the corpora, so I can directly compare what kinds of materials each includes. It's important for this ontology to be able to tell me things like "this corpus consists entirely of plays" (because one of them definitely does) but I don't know how to know in advance what categories I'll need. (I'm going to ask my mom about this, ontologies are her jam.)

Then I want to look at each individual corpus and classify its contents into my ontology categories. I'll probably do this computationally also, but it's important to me to classify at least some of each corpus by hand, to check (or train?) my computational approach. Since I can't classify 52,000 things by hand (1 minute per thing = 866 hours) I want to take a random sample, classify *that*, and say "the whole thing probably looks roughly like this." I'll probably be classifying just by title / title page so they should all be able to "respond," but if I want to look at how well those titles reflect the actual content I might start bumping up against works that I can't access (and also I'll want to use smaller samples so I can spend longer on each item.)

I'd like to use the smallest sample that is still acceptably trustworthy. I don't know what is considered acceptably trustworthy: 70%? 98%?

I have several corpora -- smallest one 466 items, biggest one 52,000 -- so I am looking for a calculation to run each time I decide to sample a new corpus. (My first instinct was to pick one number and sample that many of each one, but on reflection, that's... not right, is it? Should I sample the same *percentage* of each one?)

I'm basically treating each corpus as a non-random sample of the platonic ideal of "Printed Works In Britain 1789-99" and trying to see how each corpus represents that platonic ideal, and also trying to inch closer to that platonic ideal.</Text>

            <Title>critical context</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. </Text>

            <Text>Sandvoss, Cornel. “The death of the reader: literary theory and the study of texts in popular culture.” Fandom: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World, edited by Jonathan Gray, C. Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrington. NYU Press.

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.
What do you think?
(via fanhackers)
“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!
I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.
Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle.

            <Text>History of vernacular literature entering schools
	•	“the impetus behind the / standardization of speech does not come from the landed nobility but from a much wider and more heterogeneous group, which is beginning to recognize itself not as other than aristocratic but as part of a society of ‘gentlemen,’ defined according to norms of behavior and education rather than blood” (98)
	•	"The fact of increased upward mobility is at once the premise of ‘bourgeois ideology' -- that anyone can succeed -- and its prime source of social anxiety. … there must be neither too little nor too much social mobility.” (95)
	⁃	"Historians are now inclined to emphasize a disparity between the perception of up- ward mobility and the actual rate at which this mobility occurred. … Setting aside the question of whether this use of statistics is not intended to confound the very possibility of a class analysis, one may at least argue that the perception of upward mobility, which was ubiquitous and even hysterical in the eighteenth century, is a real event with real historical consequences.” (363)
	•	“since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless’ knowledge comes to stand… as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent." (96-97) "This ambivalence... is ultimately resolved with the entry of vernacular literature into the new, middle-class schools. The study of vernacular literature is thus at first a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97)
	•	“Just as the late medieval nobility acquired literacy but did not care to master the scholastic canon of the clergy, the middling sort wished to acquire polite speech but not necessarily a knowledge of Latin or Greek." (100)
	•	"The anxiety expressed by Sheridan is that, in the absence of an institutional form of dissemination, literary culture cannot be entrusted to preserve English works of the past; vernacular works must be revalued as equal in value to classical works and therefore worthy to be taught in the schools. This is the crucial point: the judgment of vernacular works throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries already elevates some works over others, but only the institutionalization of these works as a curriculum can revalue their cultural capital as the equal of the classics.” (101)

Merging of poetry and prose
	•	18thC prose, unlike Renaissance prose, eschewed "neologism, archaism, complex figuration, and foreign borrowing,” defined itself as being "a normalized language” (121) -- raising the stakes of prose and poetry merging
	•	elision of poetry and prose puts entire English canon in question, since "in the two previous centuries, all literature was poetry and only poetry was literature" (121)

Serious vs popular is the new high vs low
	•	the distinction between 'serious' prose and 'popular' prose is a new form of the high/low culture schism, because unlike poems vs ballads, the forms of prose are the same form (131)
	⁃	“When the successful dissemination of the standard permits production in genres which have no canonical authorization, but which are nevertheless unimpeachable vehicles of polite speech, a canonical crisis arises in the form of an anxious discrimination of ‘serious’ from ‘popular’ writing.” (132)
	•	“canonical /forms/, the categories of textual appropriation and reproduction in their institutional sites, operate as mechanisms of selection before individuals exercise judgments, of whatever kind." (123)
	•	Wordsworth, like Gray, presents “the socially distinct character of the poet threatened with effacement of obscurity in the very identification of his language with the language of the rustics” -- fear of failure of social distinction (128)

The school makes the canonical distinction
	•	what now distinguishes "serious" literature from “popular" literature is its penetration into the school system: reserving a work until higher in the school hierarchy is what grants it higher status (133)
	⁃	“As the school becomes the exclusive agent for the dissemination of High Canonical works, replacing the quasi-educational institutions, the coffeehouses, literary clubs, and salons of eighteenth-century literacy—the realm of the bourgeois public sphere—the prestige of literary works as cultural capital is assessed according to the limit of their dissemination, their relative exclusivity.” (133)
	•	the school "as the site at which social mobility is choked off" (95) -- the poor should be actively deprived of education in order to minimize too much mobility
	•	“the distinction between serious and popular genres produces no corresponding linguistic differentiation within the reading public.” (133)
	⁃	“The division of literary production into ‘literature’ and the genres which are by definition subliterary or nonliterary does eventually produce a corresponding linguistic distinction when genres are distributed by the curricula of the educational system in order to separate them out according to the levels of the system” (133)

Implications for the concept of ‘literary language’
“When a finite set of genres becomes the supergenre of ‘literature,’ all canonical works can be regarded as exemplifying a language essentially different from the language spoken by ‘real men,’ namely, ‘literary language.’ But from the vantage of the longue dureé, ‘literary language’ is nothing other than the successor to poetic diction, the reduction of all literature to a written language which produces a difference in speech, a social distinction, among those who have access to this second language through the schools. … The fact that it is still possible to speak of the intrinsic difference between literary language and ordinary language is a measure of how successfully the conservators of literature have erased its origins even in the act of writing its history.” (Guillory 132-133)


Gray’s Elegy
	•	“the proposition that the noble makes a better peasant than a peasant. ... The poem does not really address the peasantry. While the noble habitus can be represented by the imperturbably and natural nobility of literary peasants, these peasants cannot at the same time be represented as miserably impoverished. The peasants, in other words, cannot be both literary and real peasants.” (113)
	•	“The hypothetical achievements of the peasantry can be represented in the poem as at once tragically repressed; but on the other hand, no achievements are named in the poem which are not deplored as instances of Ambition, Luxury, and pride: hence Milton is flanked by Hampden and Cromwell.” (112)
	•	“Gray's landscape contains no historical social institutions, no historical aristocrats or peasants, and that is just the point of it. It is a landscape of abstract repression: ‘Penury' represses 'rage’.” -- this contrasts with Barbauld critiquing laws that blocked Dissenters from schools. (106)
	•	the lack of class mobility is “stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it. ... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that the man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities. ... Many people, without being communists, have been irritated by the complacence in the massive calm of the poem, and this seems partly because they feel there is a cheat in the implied politics” (Empson 4-5, qtd in Guillory 94)
	•	“impression of an immediate but sophisticated accessibility” -- a sense that it is all made up of familiar poetic phrases — due to the 'commonplace book’  (87)
	•	"The affect of complacence is produced... by the relation of the commonplace... to the ‘universality and impersonality’ of the style. I would like to propose that this style is produced by the systematic linguistic normalization of quotation … The cento of quotable quotations which is the poem thus generates a reception-scenario characterized by the reader's pleased recognition that 'this is my truth,' while at the same time concealing the fact that this pleasure is founded on the subliminal recognition that 'this is my language.’” (92)
	•	“The Elegy is thus at once peculiarly accessible to a wide reading public at the same time that its narrative reinscribes this access as innate rather than acquired. ... The cultural entitlement that for Gray is defined by classical literacy, by his immense learning, is thus acquired by his readers at a discount, at the cost only of acquiring the vernacular literacy requisite to reading the poem." (121)

Barbauld’s poem
	•	“Gray's poem... is followed by a poem enitled ‘Warrington Academy,' by one 'Mrs. Barbauld,' a writer no one would regard today as canonical. The adjacency of so titled a poem to Gray's call attention either to itself or to Gray, or to both." (103) No -- I don't think it CALLS attention to anything, though it might REWARD attention. Also weird that he dismisses Barbauld as if I've never heard of her, even though I totally have; she's still in the anthologies. I guess the feminists put her back in the 90s?
	•	"Barbauld was very much in the vanguard, then, of that anthologizing movement by which English literature was given a canonical form. In this context the pendant position of ‘Warrington Academy' in relation to Gray's poem is, as we may now demonstrate, not at all accidental: Barbauld's poem reads Gray's /Elegy/ and so enacts its reception.” (104) DISAGREE - could be completely accidental, or placed because it, too, describes a place.
	•	“Behind the generic veil certain social facts come sharply into focus: the struggle of individuals and social groups to rise. Gray's peasants of course do not struggle. Barbauld's word for the social fact she firmly grasps is "emulation,” which here has all of the senses to which I have assigned it, preeminently ‘to compete by imitiation.’" (104)
	•	“The important point here is that the opening lines express the fact of struggle through a rhetoric of literary culture; that culture is where the struggle takes place.” (104)
	•	“The significance of middle-class women in this movement has been recently stressed by Nancy Armstrong, "Literature as Women's History," Genre 19 (Winter 1986),367: "Today few of us realize that many features of our standard humanities curriculum came from a curriculum designed specifically for educating polite young women who were not of the ruling class, or that the teaching of native British literature developed as a means of socializing children, the poor, and foreigners be- fore we became a masculine profession." Barbauld was uniquely privileged in he / educational opportunities (she even persuaded her father, Dr. Aiken, to teach her Latin and Greek), although she was not an advocate of schools for women. She seems to have promoted instead the more unofficial instruments of literary culture as a means of disseminating knowledge to women.” (365-366)

            <Title>debate summary</Title>
            <Text>A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer &amp; Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.” Blayney’s “detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays” (F&amp;L 4) argues that playbooks “never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books” (B, qtd in F&amp;L 3) and that, based on their reprinting rate of “only” 48% of first editions, “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years” (B, qtd in F&amp;L 4). F&amp;L argue that “ like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books” (F&amp;L 4). In response, therefore, “Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends.” (F&amp;L 4). Total number of editions and frequency of reprinting To properly contextualize market share, they carefully compare plays only to other “speculative” non-monopoly works (L&amp;F 14). “Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest.” (F&amp;L 6). F&amp;L stress that they study playbooks, not playtexts.
The crucial intervention of F&amp;L’s first article is the comparison of playbooks to the marketplace at large, and to another genre (sermons), since “popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (F&amp;L 4). Also useful is the disentanglement of different metrics of popularity, since “Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (F&amp;L 26): “Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”? … For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (F&amp;L 27)
Blayney’s response take issue, first, with the books which Farmer &amp; Lesser choose to exclude, and, second, with their comparisons of percentages rather than counts. Many of his critiques rest on Early Modern historical details not relevant to my inquiry, such as his argument against Farmer &amp; Lesser’s claim that “patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (L&amp;F 17, qtd in B 38). His methodological critiques, however, are immediately applicable: regarding the comparison of reprinting percentages, he notes, “the authors ignore an elementary arithmetical truism that completely vitiates their main conclusion. Simply put, a small percentage of a large number can be much bigger than a large percentage of a small number” (B 43).
This is where I am inclined to be sympathetic to Farmer &amp; Lesser — Blayney seems to be ignoring the viewpoint from which the matter is being considered. Blayney seems to think that Lesser &amp; Farmer argue against the position that “early modern readers could really have found books of divinity more desirable than Shakespeare quartos,” (47) but this was not the question. If you have a playbook in one hand and a sermon-book in the other, which one is more likely to be reprinted? The answer to that question will have nothing to do with the total number of playbooks and sermon-books printed each year; since the question is predictive, rather than evaluative, it relies on percentages. Farmer &amp; Lesser ultimately want to contend that publishers would have published more plays if more plays had existed, that any given playbook had decent odds of turning a profit. [Why would you pose a question that way? It’s partly analogous to the question I posed re: Gothic gender, but also has a historical element. It bifurcates into one question about what kinds of books were really the best investments, and what kinds the publishers believed to be the best. F&amp;L are a bit guilty of conflating those. Blayney misses both questions, distracted by market share: see quote below from p 40] — Farmer &amp; Lesser explicitly express their wistful longing in the face of the reality that “we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books… if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists” (F&amp;L 16), whereas Blayney dismissively sniffs that “The apparent share could be artificially raised by adopting the methods by which the modern book trade constructs “top ten” lists that include only recently-published books of a specified kind” (B 47).
Blayney’s ultimate goal seems to be: “Unless we recognize and accept just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers, we will never fully understand the background of the dramatic literature we now value so much more than they did.” (B 47)
I do agree with Blayney’s central argument is that “Market share in the real world is not always greatly affected by what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell, and is not determined at all by what academics subsequently choose to study. What counts is what the customers actually buy.” (B 40). But this seems to miss Farmer &amp; Lesser’s core point that market share is not the only metric of popularity, and that “what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell” is its own valuable kind of popularity to examine.
Moreover, even if, as Blayney persuasively supports the numbers showing that, of the playbooks, “no more than 107 (32.2 percent), and perhaps only 104 (31.3 percent) were reprinted during the lifetimes of their first publishers” (45), he still has not addressed Farmer &amp; Lesser’s need to address the choice of the qualifier “only” (L&amp;F 3). By his own numbers, [what’s the fate of sermon-books??]</Text>

            <Text>Ch 1: This chapter focuses on the writing of the 1790s and illustrates the role that poetry played in the effort to mobilize Great Britain against France and to resist that mobilisation. If poetry was linked to other cultural forms in this struggle over the war in the decade that followed the French Revolution, it was also a form for which special claims were made, often presented in gendered terms. Poetry's links with ‘fancy,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘feeling’ were seen to make it crucial for representing the war and poets constantly called on these faculties as vital to their own representational strategies and to their readers' ability to respond to their visions of conflict. While poetry's feminised powers were frequently invoked, the wartime reconceptions and reformulations of poetry were often presented as a need for poetry to become more manly, a major factor in the remasculinisation of poetry in the romantic period.
Ch 2: This chapter discusses the poetic imaginings of war in the 1790s, particularly those of Charlotte Smith and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Smith's reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the 18th century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. In Fears in Solitude, Coleridge addresses a nation distant from the scene of conflict and ultimately offers his own imagining as a model for the nation. The imagining of war, then, plays a major role in the development of the romantic imagination.
Ch 3: This chapter discusses the war and poetic identity in the writings of Robert Southey and Wordsworth. In Southey's blank-verse poem, ‘History,’ he asks himself the repeated question ‘Was it for this…?’ This familiar narrative of an overwhelming sense of personal and political crisis producing a turn away from ‘History,’ often figured as here as a retreat to a bower, has been a major feature of accounts of canonical romanticism, and still holds considerable sway. Like Wordsworth's The Prelude, also begun in 1798 with the repeated question ‘Was it for this…?’, ‘History’ is a poem of poetic dedication at a time of historical crisis, but while history emerges only at the end of the two-book Prelude, in Southey's poem it is ‘History’ itself which offers the solution to the crisis.
Ch 4: This chapter discusses poetry, war, and gender in Wordsworth's political sonnets. Wordsworth's political sonnets of 1802-1803 were part of the huge outpouring of verse produced to unite, inspire, and animate the nation during the invasion scares if 1797-1798 and 1802-1805, the period that has been named ‘the Great Terror.’ This vast body of verse played an important role in the wartime forging of the British nation, both mediating the war to the British public and providing a means of patriotic expression. If poetry shaped understandings of the war in these years, the war in turn shaped poetry, limiting the kinds of writing that could be produced in such an atmosphere of national crisis. The chapter also details one example of poetic construction of the manly nation and its links to the remasculinisation of poetry, Wordworth's political sonnets.
Ch 5: This chapter discusses Walter Scott's picturesque romance of war. Scott was the bestselling and most popular poet of the Napoleonic wars and his metrical romances played a crucial role in mediating conflict to a nation at war. His phenomenally successful tales of ‘Border chivalry’ transformed the imagining of war, presenting it as heroic, shaped by the codes of romance, and framed by the conventions of the picturesque. Scott's poetry were about 16th-century wars but became popular during the Napoleonic wars. With his verse, the 18th-century emphasis on war's horrors gives way to the 19th-century stress on its glory. In addressing his readers as ‘Warriors’ in his last extended verse romance in 1814, Scott completed his remasculinisation of the reader and of poetry more generally contributing to the wartime revalidation of poetry as a manly pursuit for both writer and reader.
Ch 6: This chapter discusses the relationship of poetry and the Peninsular War. Robert Southey showed the extent to which the unfolding events in Spain has already been imagined, and written, as romance. Southey was not alone in responding to the war in the Peninsula as already shaped by the representations of ‘poets and romancers.’ The combination of geography and genre in the imaginative shaping of the latest stage of the war was compounded by the fashion for romance produced by the popularity of Walter Scott's poetry which coalesced with the sense of Spain as a land of romance to provide the major poetic framework for the British understanding of the war. The author also examines the poetic use of romance to shape and give meaning to the war, looking at the representational challenges this presented and at the poetic questioning and subversion of this generically inflected understanding of the conflict.
Ch 7: This chapter examines the works of Lord Byron and Felicia Hemans, whose obsession with war developed out of their engagement with the Peninsular War and whose poetic identities were profoundly shaped by their continued reflection on conflict. The chapter also focuses on one way in which these two writers represented war, the siege. They found in the siege a means of representing to their readership the entirety of modern war. The siege illustrates war's effects on the whole of society and it conflates within one site — the fortress, the citadel, or the walled city — the two spaces poetry frequently strives to link, the scene of conflict and the home. Both writers use the siege to explore the relations between war, gender, and history, exploiting the figure siege's rich allegorical and symbolic potential and ultimately find in it a figure for their own poetic identity.


Overall: This opening chapter, which will focus primarily on the writing of the 1790s, will begin by illustrating the role that poetry played in the effort to mobilize the country against France, and to resist that mobilization, But if poetry was linked to other cultural forms including song, theatre, and the visual arts in this struggle over the war in the decade that followed the French Revolution, it was also a form for which special claims were made, an area which will be examined in the second section of this chapter, poetry’s links with ‘fancy’, ‘imagination’, and ‘feeling’ were seen to make it crucial for representing the war and poets constantly called on these faculties as vital to their own representational strategies and to their readers’ ability to respond to their visions of conflict. As 1 will argue in the third section, the special claims made for poetry were often presented in gendered terms, While poetry’s feminized powers (and powers to feminize) were frequently invoked, the wartime reconceptions and refer, nidations of poetry were often presented as a need for poetry to become more manly, a major factor in the remasculinization of poetry in the romantic period. Finally, as an introduction to the major poetic (p.3) transformation in the imagining of war during the conflict, the fourth section will investigate some of the key tropes used to represent the war in the 1790s and the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott.</Text>

            <Title>my corpus</Title>
            <Text>My own sliver of the ESTC was generously provided to me by the British Library in January 2017. It contains all items matching the query I specified, “(Words= alldocuments and W-year= 1789-&gt;1799 and W-Country of publica= enk),” which requests all documents published between 1789 and 1799 (inclusive) with a place of publication encoded as “England.” Running this search on the ESTC website at the time returned 52,001 records. The tools used to create the file, according to the librarian with whom I corresponded, returned 51,965 records, 36 records having gone missing; however, the file itself contains only 51,860, another 105 mysteriously lost. These 141 missing records are currently an unsolved mystery. My records come from the British Library’s ESTC database, rather than the STAR file. The corpus itself consists of a csv file with fifteen columns of information. The columns are: “Type of resource” (“Monograph” or “Serial”); “ESTC citation number”; “Name” (e.g., of an author, editor or illustrator); “Dates associated with name” (generally, the years they lived); “Type of name” (“meeting/conference,” “organization,” or “person”); “Role” (e.g., “author,” “cartographer,” or “bookseller”), “All names”, “Title”, “Variant titles”, “Place of publication”, “Publisher”, “Date of publication” (a single year), “Date of publication (not standardised)” (e.g., a year in roman numerals, or a date which includes a month or day), and “Publication date range” (for serials). In other words, it includes the very basic information of author, title, publisher, and year, in a complex structure which belies the apparent simplicity of these “basics.” Some of the ESTC records included in this corpus do not necessarily match my selection criteria (England, 1789-99), which is inevitably true of every corpus collected, and which I discuss in more detail in SECTION, Data Cleaning.</Text>

I'm currently fascinated / mesmerized by this 1960s song "The Masochism Tango": youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOe…
Like, it's actually a fun kinky song, right? Except for what feels like a few points that go "too far" (I think strategically) and thus safely turn the whole thing into a "joke" (and therefore something that can be said in public)
Especially the bit at 3:20 about cigarette burns; it gets a laugh, but he sings it straight, and I know folks who'd be into that.
It makes me have more sympathy for people who want to argue that some 18thC Gothics are trying to subversively smuggle in radical ideas despite not fully committing to those ideas
even if you have to pretend that you're only kidding or otherwise 'take it back', to simply say certain things outright in the first place can be powerful..
..and the self-censored versions can circulate publicly in order to get into the hands of people who know how to decode them
So now I'm thinking of how the Toronto gay scene (in the 70s?) would use newspaper articles "warning" people away from dirty sinful gay hotspots, using lots and lots of detail in order to let other gay people know where to go and what to do
I dunno how to put all of that together, but it feels important somehow! How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers?</Text>

            <Title>background</Title>
            <Text>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.</Text>

            <Text>I am not sure what I now know about Charlotte Smith that I didn't before, but I feel like I know something. Mostly, I think, spreading all these poems out in my timeline helps to clarify that Elegiac Sonnets (like Tristram Shandy!) is not actually a single unified work representing one moment of time, but rather an assemblage that can react to the events it shapes. The re-introduction of chronological gaps makes it easier to identify where she is developing her thoughts or changing her mind, and highlights the trial-and-error of her experiments as sets of poems are entered into the record.</Text>

            <Text>account for the impact over time of works which cannot extend back in influence to before they were written, but most certainly do extend forward infinitely; no work is confined to a single moment.
Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.
When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.
(Am I impressed by longevity?? I think what matters to me here is that this is a way that "normal", "average" books have great impact: they form a context/mediascape that only makes sense as a whole.)</Text>

            <Text>Eliot's "devaluation of Milton along with major Romantic and Victorian poets, and his revaluation of the seventeenth-century ‘metaphysical' poets" -- 
"Eliot's canonical reformation remains significant for having enabled... the most important new literary pedagogies in the first half of the twentieth century, the first associated with the name of F.R. Leavis and /Scrutiny/, the second with the New Criticism. Despite the real differences between the more or less explicitly 'ideological' tenets of these movements -- Leavis's progressive by anti-Marxist critique of modernity, the New Critics' conservative advocacy of Christian ‘agrarian' values -- both set out from the same revisionist judgments about English literary history, for which the authority of Eliot as critical arbiter was constantly evoked." (134)
even though Leavis and New Critics had different ideological values, they could agree on canon reassessment because "the two movements could be seen to provide different solutions to the same social or cultural problems.” (135)
"the revaluation of vernacular works in English as the equivalent of the Greek and Roman classics provided the emergent bourgeoisie with a means of emulating the cultural capital of the aristocratic and clerical estates. The project of installing a 'literary sensibility' in the largest possible constituency was on the contrary intended to have the social function of neutralizing the very political ideologies which set the classes in opposition to one another. The literary sensibility was to unify the nation culturally just as Standard English was supposed to unify it linguistically.” (136)
"all ideology aspires to the condition of doxa" but instead encounters orthodoxy and heterodoxy ... “not even feudal culture managed to establish Christianity as a doxa, else there would have been no heresy in the Middle Ages” (137)
"As a historical substitute for doxa, however, literature seems to stand in a relation of orthodoxy to beliefs that / are no longer dominant, that is, literature stands as a testament to the absence of doxa.” (137-8)
"Or... literature itself can be installed as a sensibility that performs the social function of doxa— producing a state of cultural homogeneity, or unquestioned belief-- without ever requiring the 'imperfect' supplement of orthodoxy, without specifying directly what these beliefs are. Precisely because sensibility is not the same thing as belief, it is never subject to decay into mere orthodoxy." (138)
"literary culture and its institutions... so far from establishing a cultural doxa for the social order as a whole, or even establishing a potent ‘orthodoxy' on the basis of the literary canon, remained culturally /marginal/ to the social formation of modernity." (139)
Leavis's way of valuing a work relied on its heterodoxy: thus institutionalizing it in schools removed the grounds of its critique (140)
New Critics were the opposite -- wanted literature to support orthodoxy that could replace the church, without uni becoming church; treated orthodoxy as something covert to be discovered (140)
Leavis sees judgment as the role of the critics; New Critics see it as interpretation (which works very very hard to find exactly what it wants to find) (141)
"we shall have to examine first Eliot's systematic valorization of minor poetry, and then Cleanth Brooks's transformation of that evaluative principle into a technique of interpretation" (141)
for Eliot, “in the most desirable of historical circumstances, the individual poet has less and less to do, the form more and more. Ideally all poets are minor in a world of major form." (146)
Eliot's valorization of "minor" poets has the same problem of paradox as an embrace of "noncanonical" authors (147)
“the appearance in Eliot's criticism of a shadowy, alternative 'tradition' of minor poets has a good deal to do with the legitimation of his poetic practice, with the emergence ... of a 'modernist' poetic." (147)
Eliot wants to establish Christianity as a doxa -- “Eliot would like to see ‘Christian faith' as enabling poetic production in general. This conviction is responsible for his tendency to backdate his own religious inclinations, and thus to dispute the reading of /The Waste Land/ in which it stands as a modernist document of ‘disillusion.’” (150)
Eliot: “‘The continuity of literature is essential to its greatness; it is very largely the function of secondary writers to preserve this continuity, and to provide a body of writing which is not necessarily read by posterity, but which plays a great part in forming the link between / those writers who continue to be read.’ Such statements, as usual, empty out the category of majority on behalf of a claim for the more essential cultural function of minor writers.” (151-152)
"The tendency of Eliot's later criticism is finally to identify 'tradition' with 'orthodoxy’" (152)
Eliot's fantasy is that literary figures / literary culture can produce the social order / culture at large (152)
literary culture as partial substitution for clergy, semi-unsuccessful, esp as “The decline of the public sphere in the nineteenth century transforms the agents of literary culture into exclusively traditional intellectuals who nevertheless continue to imagine their relation to the social order as organic on the clerical model” -- literary institutional hierarchies follow clerical model (153)
"The sense in which most criticism remains, as Edward Said has argued, 'religious criticism,' is by no means simple or easy to explain, because the element of the 'religious' occupies a realm of social fantasy, which yet testifies to a certain reality about literary culture." (154)
"the social inhibition that disallows literary culture from making doctrinal claims of the 'orthodox’ sort drives these claims back into the refuge of literary form." (155)
“the emergencce of the ‘literary critic' within the generalist faction did not imply a simple repudiation of the disciplinary style of the philologist, but rather the development of a more or less rigorous countermethodology of 'interpretation' which could be put in service of ‘Generalist' aims, the aims of cultural criticism." (155)
"Eliot's narrative of English literary history as the story of a split between an orthodox minor tradition and a heterodox major line is thus displaced into allegorical explications of the 'internal structures' of the canonical texts, which all exhibit the features of paradox, irony, or ambiguity formerly attributed specifically to the metaphysicals and the moderns.” (157)
Well Wrought Urn: “If that text discovers that all canonical literature (or literature per se) speaks the 'language of paradox,’ it still reads paradox as the evidence of a 'unity of experience' no longer available to dissociated moderns, though we moderns may continue to contemplate what we have lost in the experience of the literary artifact." (157)
“doxa (what is unquestioned, impensé) and what is openly advocated, an ‘orthodoxy.’” (157)
hidden depth / revelation / centrality of the seemingly minor -- rhetoric of criticism (158)
heresy of paraphrase (158)
poetry's form as battling science, which is to blame for the dissociativeness of modernity (159)
interpretation as also a powerful alternative to science (159)
because poems achieve paradox, they don't mean what they say they mean (159)
Cleanth Brooks' approach was to look for similarities between "masterpieces" rather than historical differences, and esp similarity between "masterpieces" and metaphysicals and moderns (160)
Brooks is competing against philologists. “The school becomes the site at which the practice of reading can be cultivated in such a way as to preserve the cultural capital of literature (signified in the Brooksian allegory as a kind of /sacredness/), just because its social space can be conceived as a space of deliberate and strategic withdrawal, as the withdrawal of literary culture from 'the world’” (165)
“It remains to be seen whether the retreat of literary culture to the university was really strategic." (167)
New Critical close reading pedagogy was useful in mass educating university students who don't already have elite historical knowledge -- but it wasn't intended to be (168)
“One may... say that difficulty itself was positively valued in New Critical practice, that it was a form of cultural capital, just by virtue of imparting to cultural objects a certain kind of /rarity/, the very difficulty of apprehending them." (168)
“The revaluation of difficulty on behalf of both metaphysicals and moderns is a consistent objective of /The Well Wrought Urn/" (169)
Brooks has to make the established literary curriculum seem difficult, in order to show that all poetry is inherently difficult, in order to show that modernist poetry is justified in being difficult (170)
1920s and 30s taught a bunch contemporary poets I don't know as *modern* poets, *because* they accessibly expressed positive identification with their contemporary culture (170)
"the very existence of a ‘popular' literary modernism testified to a temporary blurring of the cultural capital embodied by literature and by the artifacts of mass culture. Hence the anthologies of the period... included as representative modern poems... works which it is difficult to regard not as anything other than kitsch, perhaps the least interesting ‘popular' artifacts of the twentieth century." (171)
the successful distribution of Standard English (via literature) at lower levels of schooling left no way to distinguish higher levels of schooling: hence the need to revalue difficulty (171)
“the valuation of difficulty in New Critical practice never had to be expressed, and could not be expressed, as the devaluation of Standard English itself" (172) even though difficulty served the function of being more valuable than simple standard english
“In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, these new students also discovered at the sae moment why it needed to be studied /in the university/“ (172)
“Literature... presents a united front, in the form of its intrinsic /difficulty/, against the artifacts of mass culture” (173)
“Therein lies the peculiar power of mass culture, since the waning cultural centrality of literary works in the face of new mass cultural forms never entailed a denial of the nominally superior value of literature” -- readers of mass media “would no doubt have concede the cultural superiority of literature, whether or not [they] ever felt inclined to read any works so designated" (173)
In 1976 4th ed of Understanding Poetry, Donne's "The Canonization" “is contrasted not with secular, scientific culture, its antagonist in The Well Wrought Urn” but with a popular song from the 1920s (173)
“the mass culture of modernity never coveted the institutional space to which literary culture retreated" -- uni students dutifully studied &amp; accepted the value of literature but “continued to consume both kinds of artifacts in the distinct spheres of their consumption" (174)
“The capacity to experience the social space of the schools and the social space of mass culture as disjunct effectively institutionalized two modes of consumption, one consequence of which was to make literary works more difficult to consume outside the school." (174)
alludes lightly to the fact that "mass culture can be stigmatized by association with the lurid taste of the female consumer” (175)
Brooks praises older literature for its ability to inhabit ambiguity, but “When the choice is between literary culture and mass culture, however, there is no question of 'both-and.’ ... [but] neither the polemic against secularity nor the polemic on behalf of Eliot's canonical choices proved capable of imposing Brooks's ‘either-or’ upon the generation of postwar readers. The effect of New Critical pedagogy was rather to produce a kind of recusant literary culture, at once faithful to the quasi-sacred authority of literature but paying tribute at the same time to the secular authority of a derogated mass culture. For the recusants the artifact of mass culture might be consumed with a certain guilt, or a certain relief; but for those whose allegiance was sworn to secular authority, that culture provided everything there was to consume." (175)

Footnotes
7 “A particular passage of Eliot's is worth noting in "What Is a Classic?" opp: "The predecessors should be themselves great and honoured: but their accomplish- ment must be such as to suggest still undeveloped resources of the language, and not such as to oppress the younger writers with the fear that everything that can be done has been done, in their language” (58).” (369)
“Another consequence, which may have been equally serious, was that literary education relieved one of the necessity of "reading" mass cultural artifacts. If the refusal of reading (that is, of interpretation) in the domain of mass culture no longer has the excuse it once had, it has not been without considerable resistance that in- terpretation has been wrested from its privilege as the High Cultural mode of con- sumption. Witness the struggle of Film Studies to establish its legitimacy in the university.”  (370) — by which he means that the existence of literature as the site for interpretation/criticism frees mass culture from interpretation/criticism, to the extent that it was difficult for film studies to establish its right to conduct interpretation (or more recently, video game studies)</Text>

            <Text>“in fact 'aesthetic value' is nothing more or other than cultural capital." (332)
	•	“Bourdieu's sociology radically historicizes the ‘aesthetic disposition' by insisting upon its determination within a class-structured society" (337)
	⁃	“the mode of consumption demanded by the products of restricted production offered to the dominant classes a more reliable means of restricting access to the work of art than the mechanism of price itself. This was a consequence of the fact that the mode of consumption appropriate to the objects of restricted pro-/duction assumed the possession of the cultural capital provided by a particular kind of education” (329-330)
	⁃	"as cultural works recede into the past, they simultaneously gravitate into the realm of 'restricted production'... by virtue of the fact that the knowledge required to decipher them is the cultural capital of the school." (330)
	•	"To say that the aesthetic disposition determines the relative cultural capital granted to any particular work is to say that the act of judgment is the assignment, or even the recognition, of cultural capital. Judgment is the act by which the aesthetic disposition expresses or externalizes itself, according to criteria which are relatively internalized, that is, neither capable of being fully rationalized, nor materially caused in the manner of a biological predisposition.” (332)
	•	"It is no accident that the problem of a specifically ‘aesthetic value' should arise most urgently in the debate on pornography, for it is just in this context that the distinction between aesthetic discourse and the discourse of value evinces the pretensions of both discourses to 'universalize’ / within the boundaries of 'local' communities a particular value." (279-80)

He has a LONG history of the discourses of economics, aesthetics, and ‘moral philosophy’
Key concept: the problem of (in?)commensurability
	•	"the practice of judging works of art need make no reference at all to the concept of value before the emergence of political economy… the comparison of authors or works to one another need not at that time be expressed as the comparison of their relative 'aesthetic values,' because neither the concept of the aesthetic, nor the concept of value, are as yet defined in such a way that they can be yoked together.” (303)
	•	“the market is the historical /condition/ and not merely the proper analogy for the extension of the value-concept to all acts of judgment." (324)
	⁃	“In order to reestablish the proportion of production and consumption, political economy must invent the concept of 'use value,' on the analogy of 'exchange value.’ Casting its lot with an ahtropology of needs, it has to forget the aesthetic theory which posited the surplus of beauty over use as the motor of production, as the engine of social life. The theory of taste becomes irrelevant to political economy, and the 'invisible hand' can be reconceived" (315)
	⁃	“just as bourgeois political economists found it necessary to discard aesthetics, in order to make sense of the system of production and exchange, so did the bourgeoisie find it necessary to take up a 'pure' aesthetics supposedly uncontaminated by economic considerations, in order to distinguish itself /culturally/ from the class which produced what it consumed." (316)
	⁃	“aesthetics immediately reasserted, against the universality of economic commensurability, a theory of the incommensurability of aesthetic and economic values, on the basis of the inutility of the aesthetic object.” (317)
	⁃	"The premise of our social life is the absolute commensurability of everything. The language of judgment has been transformed into the discourse of ‘value-judgments’” --&gt; "cultural relativism's celebration of the plurality of values” (323)

Actual aesthetics are everywhere
	•	Bourdieu - “while there are two fields of production-- the restricted (High Art) and general (cultural commodities)-- there are three principles of legitimacy specific to these fields” aka 1, ‘“art for artists” (“'art for art's sake’") for High Art; 2, art for the social elite, “‘bourgeois' taste”, also for High Art; 3, "the principle of legitimacy which its advocates call 'popular’,” mass consumption, for cultural commodities (330)
	•	"For Bourdieu, aesthetic judgment comes in two forms: an elite aesthetic of the dominant classes, the ‘aesthetic disposition' proper, and a ‘popular' aesthetic of the dominated." (332)
	⁃	What appears in the place of aesthetic pleasure in the dominant classes is the pleasure of _distinction_, pleasure in the possession of cultural capital." (333)
	•	“the largest effect of the discourse of canonicity: the illusion that aesthetic experience is really restricted to the experience of High Cultural works." (336)
	⁃	“As Michael Denning has recently reminded us, there are innumerable examples in working-class cultural forms of formal experiment and variation; it is precisely the experience of formal innovation which engages interest and admiration in these consumers, even though such manifestly aesthetic experience... may fail to be recognized as aesthetic.” (336)
	⁃	"The recognition of cultural capital, otherwise known as aesthetic judgment, must deny, as a condition of its exercise, the ubiquity of aesthetic experience, the fact that such experience utterly pervades the field of cultural production." (336)

What other worlds are possible?
First, have to actually reform access.
	•	Bourdieu: “‘[T]o deny evaluative dichotomies is to pass a morality off for a politics. The dominated in the artistic and the intellectual fields have always practiced that form of radical chic which consists in rehabilitating socially inferior cultures of the minor genres of legitimate culture. ... To denounce hierarchy does not get us / anywhere. What must be changed are the conditions that make this hierarchy exist, both in reality and in minds. We must—I have never stopped repeating it—work to universalize in reality the conditions of access to what the present offers us that is most universal.’" (339-340)
	•	"In a culture of such universal access, canonical works could not be experienced as they so often are, as lifeless monuments, or as proofs of class distinction. Insofar as the debate on the canon has tended to discredit aesthetic judgment, or to express a certain embarrassment with its metaphysical pretensions and its political biases, it has quite missed the point. The point is not to make judgment disappear but to reform the conditions of its practice. If there is no way out of the game of culture, then, even when cultural capital is the only kind of capital, there may be another kind of game, with less dire consequences for the losers, an aesthetic game. Socializing the means of production and consumption would be the condition of an aestheticism unbound, not its overcoming. But of course, this is only a thought experiment." (340)

Then, works will still compete, but differently.
	•	“The idea of production for the producers (which by definition entails /consumption/ by the producers) projects onto a utopian screen the disarticulation of cultural capital from the system of class formation, and thus from ‘distinction' based on inequality of access to cultural goods. Bourdieu calls this condition 'total autonomy from the laws of the market.' Such a condition does not, however, prophesy the disappearance of cultural capital. The universalization of restricted production would rather transform cultural capital into pure 'symbolic distinction.’” (339)
	⁃	“Even were such an educational system no longer to regulate access to cultural capital in the grotesquely unequal way it presently does, cultural producers would still compete to have their products read, studied, looked at, heard, lived in, sung, worn, and would still accumulate cultural capital in the form of 'prestige’ or fame. But social distinctions reinstated on such an aesthetic basis would have to be expressed in social relations as distinctions in ‘lifestyle,' in other words a vast enlargement of the field of aesthetic judgment." (339)
	⁃	“What we call canon formation would then become a much larger part of social life, because not restricted to the institutions of the materially advantaged.” (339)

            <Title>coda? - gothic</Title>
            <Text>A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.</Text>

            <Title>Korshin, Paul. Review of ESTC history</Title>
            <Text>“Exploratory studies, poorly funded and inadequate though they were, began in the next decade, but not until 1975 did the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies take the initiative in North America, which was swiftly followed and far surpassed by the interest of the British Library, that has led to the present Eighteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue Project.” (Korshin 209)

"The British Library Project maintains a number of manual files based on the works they have catalogued (by mid October 1978, the team had cataogued mor ethan 110,00 items, with a total of 75,000 entries; the difference represents multiple copies), and one can see from this account how usedul the completed work will be to the scholarly and library world. Indeed, as scholars who visit the Project at the British Library or who have been in touch with Alston and Jannetta by letter have already found, even the incomplete British Library file is tremendously helpful to the researcher.” (210)

“The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,” especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). “Panizzis ‘Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book inhis or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.” (Korshin 211)

“By 1984, it is expected that a joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file to that point will be published in computer-output microform (COM).” (Korshin 212)

            <Text>My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.
I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” </Text>

            <Text>me I think I've talked to you about this also? the escapist fantasy, in a novel where women are powerless to do anything but cry when kidnapped, is that the crying will work
hbbo oh, huh--I don't think we have had this conversation, but that makes a lot of sense
me I've been thinking, also, about the virtues of the Gothic as a narrative mode which doesn't truck with any bullshit about women's place in the world. Powerful men are tyrants who can destroy you! Your feelings are correct on that front! You are excruciatingly vulnerable! And now here is a story where everything turns out okay anyway.
hbbo yes. a space in which to really lug out all those repressed anxieties and blow them up as big as they're able to go can be very cathartic for sure and not only cathartic but useful
me yeah, yeah The contemporary narrative of an "empowering" story for women is about women having power, and indeed a lot of criticism looks at these works to try to find the particular womanly kinds or spheres of power that make the texts "subversive" or "progressive"... and I do see some of that, there is a compelling thread of women having access to emotional manipulation of men as an effective strategy that makes men look foolish and less powerful
hbbo /me nods
me but I think for the most part they're not trying to say, "you have the incredible power of emotional manipulation!" -- I really think they're wallowing in the abjectness of acknowledging powerlessness and, this is the part that has been firing up my soul, the thing you can do, when you have no power, is you can refuse to endorse your oppressor's actions
hbbo /me nods
me this is a bit of a fantasy too, really, but it's one that speaks to me -- the idea that as long as you make them FORCE you, as long as you don't capitulate, that's -- it's not POWER, but..... hands in the air this is where I don't know what I'm saying yet
hbbo no, yeah, it's at the very least a sort of sovereignty over the self
me ooooooh, yeah sovereignty is a good term for it
me hmm, I'm thinking now that there's also a sort of exposure of tyranny, too. If you refuse to walk with your kidnapper and force him to carry you, you deprive him of some of his illusions
hbbo right I feel like this comes up a lot in like idk, narratives of long captivity, I'm trying to think of examples
me oh, yeah, there would be a connection there
hbbo like in 1984, he talks a lot under torture but it's not until he voluntarily betrays his lover that his selfhood is really broken
me ohhhh, yeah man, I read that novel like a decade too young to get anything out of it, I should revisit it
hbbo I mean, DEBATABLE how voluntary that really is if your alternative is getting your face eaten off by rats, but still
me well, the 18thC heroine ideal is to literally die before, say, signing paperwork allowing someone to take her ancestral property
hbbo yeah I read it ages ago as well ahahahahaha yes
me but that feels like part of the fantasy, this idea that you actually will just get your face eaten off by rats before you betray your own self even if in all other interactions you are timid and delicate 1984 of course not being interested in fantasy</Text>

            <Text>Review Reviewed Work(s): Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation by John Guillory Review by: David Punter Source: The Yearbook of English Studies, Vol. 25, Non-Standard Englishes and the New Media Special Number (1995), pp. 229-230 Published by: Modern Humanities Research Association Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3508832 Accessed: 01-06-2019 21:45 UTC 


“John Guillory sets out to describe aspects of the formation of the literary canon within a specific theoretical framework, which he develops as the book foes on. His essential argument is aimed against the notion that the canon can be seen as typified by specific inclusions and exclusions; this, he says, is ot see it as bodelled too closely on social formations and to confuse different meanings of the term ‘representation.’ Instead, he presents us with a more materialist account, owing a great deal to Bourdieu, which connects the canon directly with issues of literacy and which offers as as its crucial site the 'school’.” (Punter 229)
“This argument is advanced in five stages. First, Guillory offers a summary of the current debate about canonicity and non-canonicity, an account which is devoted principally, and rightly, to pointing up the incoherence of much current thinking on the topic. After this he moves to three 'case studies' in what one can only call canonization: the institution of a vernacular canon in the eighteenth century; the canonical changes inaugurated by the rise and dominance of the New Criticism / in the universities; the appearance and consolidation of a 'canon of theory' over the last decades. Finally he turns to a series of reflections on the question of value, a question which has clearly been latent in his argument from the beginning.” (Punter 229-230)
Critique: not specific enough about “the school,” esp its national context
“We may, as Guillory contends, be in 'the twilight years of theory', a phrase with an oddly post-romantic flavour, but I am not convinced that his book makes a real contribution to thinking us through these years: we know, of course, that literacy is a crucial social weapon, but what we do not know, and what Guillory appears not to know either, is what we do about this dangerous but politically useless knowledge.We know also that canonicity is all too dependent on specific notions of the 'master' and that 'theory' has all too frequently intensified this nexus of suspect relationship and thus of monolithism within the institutions; but what the conditions would be for a wider distribution of authority within the domain of literacy remains a puzzle.A puzzle honourable to perceive, indeed, and honourably worked at; but I did not feel that the parts of this book, excellent as some of them are, added up to a wholewhich could mobilize a countervailing force of the strength Guillory himself says would be necessary against the forces of recapitulation which, as he also rightly says, currently govern the processes of canon formation and act, by ignoring the real and complex psychodynamics of the pedagogic, to purge the field of any trace of the subversive.” (Punter 230)</Text>

            <Text>Chapter five takes the complex methodologies developed in the preceding three chapters, and stress-tests them on More’s difficult publication history. The many Cheap Repository Tracts are difficult to comprehensively identify and attribute authorship to: how have digital resources dealt with these challenges? I am particularly interested in examining publication details which More might have exaggerated for promotional purposes: what grounds can be identified for her claims of exceptional circulation rates? Of particular interest is the fact that More reprinted some Cheap Repository Tracts in different formats for different price points and audiences. Can these differences be captured in the databases I examine? Examining More’s oeuvre also raises questions of literariness: if, as I expect, the Cheap Repository Tracts are excluded from more selective databases, is this appropriate? What kinds of “non-literary” writing is included in each database? This question brings my bibliographic research back home to the core questions about canon-building which drive my inquiry. To this point, I have sought ways to evaluate authors’ popularity and their importance in the print marketplace, as related metrics which underly the authors’ reputations. With More, I explore directly the use of literariness as an inherently unquantifiable metric of selection.</Text>

            <Text>Betty T. Bennett’s estimate that there were over 3,000 short poems on the war published in newspapers, periodicals, and magazines supports such contemporary claims (BWP&gt; p. ix). Over 200 individual volumes of poetry with titles referring to the war, battles, or military or naval figures, were reviewed in periodicals between 1798 and 1820, a count which obviously excludes those works not reviewed and. does not give any idea of the number of war poems contained in collections of (p.4) verse with non-specific titles.

During the period of the invasion crisis, from 1797 to 1805, poetry, along with, other forms of writing, was seen as almost exclusively devoted to the French threat; as the Gentleman’s Magazine commented, ‘[i]n poetry or prose the universal, object of patriotic Britons is, to pursue and expose the Invader of the rights of human kind’ (p 4)

The British war effort was indeed huge, ‘prima facie at least as big. as France’s’, according to Geoffrey Best, with the regular army expanding from 40,000 men in 1793 to 250,000 in 1813 and the navy from 45,000 sailors in February 1793 to 145,000 in 1812.11 These regular armed forces (p.6) were supplemented by volunteer forces which at the height of the invasion crisis of 1803 numbered as many as 400,000 men.12 It has been estimated that during this period of invasion crisis, from 1797 to 1804, as many as one in six, or even one in five, of all adult males was involved in the armed forces in either a voluntary or an enrolled position.13

They have also been estimated to have cost 315,000 British lives, which, as Best argues, by one statistical method can be presented as a higher proportion of servicemen than that lost in the first world war«15 As David Gates has shown, the casualty rate of the wars was high, with 18,596 dying in 1794 on active service and 40,639 men discharged ‘on account of wounds or infirmity’ over the next two years. The attrition rate remained high throughout the Napoleonic wars, 16,000–24,000 casualties being incurred each year,16 (p. 6)

For example, the broadsheet ballad ‘Millions be Free: A New Song, Tune—“To Anacreon in Heaven”’, part of the Bodleian ballad collection, was also printed in a less radical version as ‘An Ode on the Restoration, of Freedom to France’ in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in January 1793.30 The broadsheet version of this poem, ‘Millions be Free’, written in the context of the French decree of November 1792 offering ‘fraternity and assistance to all peoples who seek to recover their liberty’31 concludes each stanza by looking forward to the spread of revolutionary ideology with a variant of the couplet—‘While FRANCE rises up, and proclaims the DECREE, | That tears off our Chains, and bids MILLIONS BE FREE’. The ‘Ode’ ends each stanza with ‘That tears off their our chains, and bids millions be free’ (emphasis added), which like its title (‘An Ode on the Restoration of Freedom to France’) and certain subtle but significant changes in tenses, allows the poem to be read as a celebration of the Revolution in France without the broadsheet’s call for the future spread of revolutionary freedom, The ‘Ode’ version illustrates Michael Scrivener’s argument that ambiguity was a necessary feature of much of the radical verse published in newspapers and magazines, enabling a text to satisfy different factions or ‘sides’ (PR.28–9), whereas the anonymous broadsheet version was able to present a more direct and extreme message. As this suggests, texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration (PR 26). (P. 10)

In this context, it is unnecessary and reductive to make too careful a distinction between ‘poetry’ and ‘song’, given that the same text could be experienced in these different ways, though it is important to bear in mind how different realizations of the text may have an impact on its mediation of the war. (P. 11)

As well as its links with the ballad and song tradition, poetry had strong connections to theatrical and visual culture, which also mediated the war to the British public, frequently calling upon a deep-rooted Francophobia which held a strong place in the popular imagination. The theatre provided one arena for the singing of patriotic songs and the performance of bellicose poetry. As Gillian Russell has argued in an excellent study of the interrelation between the theatre and the war, the various elements of ‘an evening’s entertainment at the theatre consisting of music, song, interlude, occasional addresses, afterpieces, pantomime, pageants, and spectacle … considered together. «.… reveal the extent to which the whole enterprise of the theatre at this time was dedicated to the commemoration of the war and the enhancement of patriotic values’.37 ) (P. 12)

Similarly, poetry and visual culture were frequently mutually reinforcing in their constructions of the war. The interrelation of the two forms is well illustrated by the republication in the government-controlled newspaper The Star in December 1793 of David Garrick’s two (p.13) inscriptions written to accompany William Hogarth’s pair of prints, The Invasion39 These prints had been published in March 1756, shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years War with France, and Garrick’s verses read like a collection, of the clichés of French and English national identity … The republication of these verses illustrates the extent to which at the outbreak of the war in 1793 there already existed a powerful set of ideas about British and French national identities that could be easily invoked (p.14)through stock, images and phrases.

The poetry of the 1790s often stresses the continuity of the French threat, even if Hogarth’s and Garrick’s embodiment of it in the figures of priests with ‘their axes, wheels and ropes’ are replaced by sansculottes with their guillotine. For example, a widely read poem of 1793, ‘A Word to the Wise, A New Ballad on the Times’,45presents the French ‘Mounseers’(echoing the word used by Garrick) as threatening ‘Englishmen’ in various ways, including stealing their food, teaching them to dance, talking in clubs, murdering women and priests, destroying the institution of marriage, and indulging in wife-swapping and cannibalism, With its (p.15)presentation of dance teachers as a kind of advanced guard, the poem draws on eighteenth-century anxieties about French fashions and interests making England, ‘a province of France’.
— How does he know it’s widely-read?

Just as anti-Gallican and pro-war writers and editors had a range of sources from which they could draw in their representations of the war, so too did ‘the friends of peace’, the various groupings who held a variety of anti-war convictions during the period.47 For example, a feature of the early issues of the Cambridge Intelligencer, which was founded in July 1793 and gained a ‘national reputation as it promoted anti-war opinions’,48 was its republication of earlier poems of anti-war protest, such as John Scott’s ‘The Drum’, first published in his Poetical Works (1782) and widely reprinted (BWP 80). (P. 15)

The continued power of ‘The Dram’ during the wars is illustrated by the pro-war, patriotic parody of it. beginning ‘I love that drum’s inspiring sound’, published in the Gentleman’s Magazine in 1804 (BWP 330). Like its republication of ‘The Drum’, the Cambridge Intelligencer’s publication of a sixteen-line extract from a poem by Bielby Porteous, who became Bishop of London in 1787, written when he was a student at Cambridge in 1759, shows how the anti-war sentiment of the opening years of the war drew on the eighteenth-century enlightenment critique of international conflict. Printed under the title ‘The Bishop of London’s Opinion on War’, the lines present a powerful critique of war as the product of kings’ ‘Ambitions’

While Scott crucially transformed the way in which conflict was imagined during the Napoleonic period, as I will argue his emphasis on poetry’s power in enabling the reader to imagine battle exemplifies one of the era’s key ideas about the representation of war. As a number of critics have observed, for the majority of the population, war, at least in the form of battle, was something that took place outside their immediate experience, Mary A Favret has put this case most forcefully in her essay ‘Coming Home: The Public Spaces of Romantic War’, in which she sees print culture as protecting the population from the conflict, arguing that in ‘the years between 1793 and 1815 when England was almost constantly at war with France, publicity raised a paper shield—a shield of newspaper reports, pamphlets, songs and poems—against the destructive violence of war’.53 Denied the empirical, contact with war’, the population experience it only through the mediating, filtering, and altering forms of intellectual, and. verbal conventions which ‘shield’, ‘cloak’, and even make ‘invisible’ ‘the first major European war in. the era of the public sphere’ (539). In this book I want to counter Favret’s argument by stressing that writers were acutely aware of this sense of distance between the reading public and the war and that they saw the imagination as the means of bridging this gap and of making war visible (p. 18)

For example, when the publication of the Wickham-Barthélemy correspondence in April 1796 brought to an end Coleridge’s hopes that negotiations between Britain and France would lead to peace, he responded by publishing in The Watchman extracts from An Accurate and Impartial Narrative of the War describing the British campaigns of 1794–5, prefacing them with the (p.19) comment: ‘The horrors of war must therefore be re-commenced.—Let those who sit by the fire-side, and hear of them at safe distance attentively peruse the following’.54 Here Coleridge places his faith in an eyewitness account of the treatment of the wounded and of the casualties of war to bridge the gap between the safety of the fireside and the scene of war, but in much of the war writing of the period it was through the ‘imagination’ or ‘fancy’ that readers could themselves become eyewitnesses to the conflict (p. 18)

Though, probably written in 1791 prior to the outbreak of the war with France,72 Southey published ‘To Horror’ in. Poems (1797), where it becomes an important part of the anti-war strand of that volume (in which it was followed by two of Southey’s best known anti-war poems ‘The Soldier’s Wife’ and ‘The Widow’) and he heightened the poem’s attack on war and linked it to the current conflict by attaching to it a lengthy footnote which presented a ‘picture of consummate horror’ in the form of the eyewitness account of the campaign of the British expeditionary force in Flanders in 1793–5 that Coleridge had quoted in The Watchman.73 (P. 24)

If the imaginative grand tour of the sublime ode provided one means of transporting the poet and reader to the battlefield, another poetic (p.25) means of paying an imaginative visit to the scene of conflict was provided by the sub-genre of ‘The Field of Battle’ poem, a category which I have named after Thomas Penrose’s highly popular mid-eighteenth-century work of that name.74 Penrose’s poem remained popular throughout the romantic period; it was republished in the Gentleman’s and London Magazine in May 1794 and The Courier in January 1800 and included by Thomas Campbell in his Specimens of the British Poets (1819), as well as being widely adapted.75  (P. 24-5)

As these versions of the ‘Ode to Fancy’ and ‘The Field of Battle’ illustrate, throughout the 1790s poetry was adopted as a form through which the imagination could ‘paint’, ‘picture’ or ‘portray’ war. … The picturing of war through the poetic imagination was used by both those who sought to celebrate war and those who wished to condemn it. (P. 27)

Fawcett reinforces the overall claim of this poem, and of the volume as a whole in a note to this stanza in which he provides a prose equivalent to his poetic strategy, arguing that the cold reports of the newspapers disguise the individual histories of war, in which each statistic: (p.30) “stands for a long pathetic story (which, if told at length, could not fail to bring tears into all eyes) of a dying man, extended on the cold, uncurtained, unpil-lowed, unattended, conch of earth; trampled on, or passed by, with savage neglect, instead of being surrounded with soothing ministers to his final necessities; and encompassed, instead of the silence of the chamber of death, with scenes of tumult and distraction! Who, that contemplated, in the sum of the slain, at the conclusion of a battle, an accumulation of such affecting pictures as this, could read the tragical amount, without a horror that should cause his head to swim, and strike a sickness into his heart?” (11)
As this Hymn suggests, representations of suffering on the battlefield were central to- anti-war poetics, contrary to influential recent arguments that the British, reading public was protected, from the horrors of war by print culture. After all, the Anti-jacobin identified the portrayal of the physical damage of war as one of the central features of Jacobin poetry: ‘we are presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered peasants, and deserted looms’.85 To use the terms of the texts themselves, the war poetry of the period is a poetry of piercing and boring,86 of wounding and bleeding,87 of mangling, shattering, breaking, (p.31)maiming and scarring,88 of agonizing pain and groaning,89 and of dying.90 The ‘horrid scene’ of ‘The Field of Bailie”, strewn with ‘Slaughter’d men and mangled cattle’,91 becomes the crucial site for the representation of war’s damage, whether represented in the poetic diction of the eighteenth century as ‘th’ensanguin’d plain’ and ‘the blood-empurpled plain’, or in the graphic terms used to describe the scene of conflict in January 1795, ‘Belgia’s reeking plain’ where ‘Alternate horrors rise and reign!’92 Rather than, protecting, the British public from the destructive violence of conflict, much of the poetry of the period aimed to make the reader feel war’s pain and suffering; war poetry was more like a paper bullet than a paper shield.

As much recent theoretical work has shown, war is inextricably linked (p.33) to the production, reproduction, and circulation in society of ideas about gender and gender roles.93 It has been argued that, after biological reproduction, war is the activity where the division of labour along gender lines has been the most obvious and where sexual difference has seemed the most absolute and natural

In all these cases the enactment of a specific role demanded by the emergency of war enables women to move beyond what is perceived to be their natural role, a process which can be presented as either only a temporary necessity before the natural role is resumed or a more radical questioning of the construction of such roles. (P. 34)

But for other poets war threatened to overwhelm poetry and to render it irrelevant, an anxiety expressed by Elizabeth Moody in the “Preface’ to her collection of poems of 1798, Poetic Trifles:
I am well aware that this is no period favourable to the Muse.
	•	This is no time for calm, familiar talk,
	•	Like man and maidens in an evening, walk.
	•	War is our business. POPE’S HOMER
At a season, therefore, like the present,—when the monster WAR is sounding his terrific alarms;—when the spirit of discord is in the air, and pervades every Atmosphere,—when it not only stimulates the combatants in the field of battle, but in the field of Literature,—when the fiend POLITICS is sharpening the pen to make it like a two-edged sword; and the Pamphleteer builds his hopes of Celebrity on the basis of Spleen and Acrimony—How I presume to ask, may the compilation of a few harmless Numbers be expected to engage the public attention?106
Here Moody locates, poetry within the context of the ongoing pamphlet war of the 1790s, and suggests the tension between the dominating political concerns of the decade and poetry’s supposed ability to transcend (p.38) such historical crises. While displaying the diffidence required of a woman poet in the later years of this decade (especially in a volume beginning with a poem entitled ‘Thoughts on War and Peace’), Moody’s comments raise a number of the major concerns of this book. How could poetry, ‘a few harmless numbers’, engage the attention of the reading public in wartime? Was there a role for it when confronted with ‘the monster WAR”? If poetry was constructed, as feminized, particularly in its elevated forms, in a period when the nation was demanding manliness-embodied in the active figures of the soldier, the sailor, the volunteer, and even the nation itself, how could poets—be they men or women-speak on international events with authority? And at a time when ‘Literature” itself was becoming defined by the field of battle, what would be the impact on poetry of more than two decades of conflict between Britain and France?107 (p. 37-8)

As mentioned above, it has been estimated that one in four families was directly involved in the wars and like much of the poetry of the 1790s ‘Effects of War’ emphasizes that while war is fought abroad its effects are felt at home. Much of this poetry focused on widows and orphans, calling on their tears and sighs as the ultimate indictment of war» a technique with biblical and classical precedent.114 Already an important figure in the literature of sensibility, the widow was used in numerous poems to represent the cost of conflict  … The widow also became the subject of the writing of some of the most ambitious poets of the decade, including Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, and Robert Southey, whose work will be examined in the next two chapters. These writers made particular use of one of the sub-genres of war poetry in the period, the ‘ruined cottage’ poem which figures war’s impact on the domestic sphere through the image of the increasingly dilapidated building, often a symbol for the widow herself.116 Poets also used the ‘ruined cottage’ form to represent the more general social and economic crisis caused by conflict (p. 40)

Robert Merry’s poem ‘The Wounded Soldier’, written circa 1795 and printed in The Spirit of the Public Journals in 1799, illustrates this fusion of war’s damage to the soldier and to the home in startling fashion (BWP, 242).

Other poems rewrite returning soldier narratives to contain the troubling implications of the figure. One such piece, ‘The Soldier’s Return’, published in the Scat’s Magazine in April 1804, reads like a rewriting of Merry’s ‘The Wounded Soldier’ as a returning soldier worries that his sudden reappearance might produce a similarly fatal effect on his loved ones (p. 43) … ‘The Soldier’s Return’, then, repeatedly invokes the tropes of anti-war poetry only to present them as fictions; the soldier’s injuries are lies and his story ‘feign’d’. Published in the year after the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens and during the period of invasion crisis, ‘The Soldier’s Return’ reclaims an anti-war figure for patriotic purposes, making the returning soldier a figure in a comic narrative of war that ends in marriage rather than the grave. Yet it is a narrative shadowed by its tragic other, in a poem of illusions, the father’s exclamation that he and his wife may ‘escape the grave’ strikes a note of romantic fantasy that emphasizes that it is the soldier’s own escaping of the grave that is the poem’s real illusion. (P. 44)

While the writers of such verse may not really expect their poems to be read by ‘the self-call’d great’ or ‘Monarchs’, they use such figures as a means of illustrating poetry’s potential power on the reader, calling especially on the language and models of sensibility. (P.45)

Published in November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin’s lament predates Nelson’s much celebrated triumph at the battle of the Nile of 1 August 1798, yet even before this ‘glorious victory’ there was no lack of poets keen to sing the actions of British heroes, with the naval victories of Howe over the French on the ‘Glorious First of June’ 1794 and Duncan over the Dutch at Camperdown in 1797 providing popular opportunities. Similarly there did exist a poetic register for overwhelming the ‘horrors of war in its glory’, seen, for example, in a poem by ‘Panormus’ published sixteen months before the declaration of war entitled ‘The Triumphant Warrior’ which celebrates war as a uniting force that provides an opportunity to prove one’s bravery and to gain honour and fame (p.47)

One poet who might have hoped that he filled the Anti-Jacobin’s role of ‘one good and true poet’ was Henry James Pye, appointed Poet Laureate in 1790, whose ‘duteous Muse’ produced two ‘Odes’ each year, one for the New Year and one for the king’s birthday, as well as other occasional pieces to celebrate particular occasions.128 These odes were set to music by the court musician and sung before the king at the state drawing rooms, after which they were widely published.129 (p. 48)

In his non-laureate verse, Pye sought to use poetry to urge the war’s continuation and to inspire his readers’ participation in it, publishing translations of the elegies of the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus in 1795, for example.135Pye’s attempts to inspire martial fervour met with a mixed reception, however, and an amusing account included by T. J. Mathias in a note to the 1796 edition of The Pursuits of Literature illustrates the varying appeal of his poetry to different sections of society. According to this account, ‘[s]everal of the ReviewingGenerals … were much impressed with (the] weight and importance’ of the translations and had them “read aloud at Warley Common and at Barham Downs, by the adjutants, at the head of five different regiments, at each camp, and much was expected. But before they were half finished, all the front ranks, and as many of the others as were within hearing or verse-shot, dropped their arms suddenly, and were all found fast asleep!”136 (p.50) The laureate’s failure to inspire the troops reinforces the Anti-Jacobin’s sense of the lack of ‘One good and true poet’ and suggests the need for a different poetic mode to bolster the war against France, a mode that would be supplied by the metrical romances of Scott, who would become the unofficial laureate and whose poetry was capable of inspiring soldiers even in the arena of conflict.
Over the next few years the Gentleman’s Magazinewould adopt Tasker as their version of the bard whose work was ‘so well calculated to animate loyal Britons against invaders, and to inspire the necessary unanimity and concord’ and was ‘exceedingly well adapted to the present times; since it breathes a threefold spirit of Poetry, Loyalty, and Patriotism’.151 Over a nine-month period from December 1798 to August 1799 it reprinted the ‘Ode to the Warlike Genius of Great Britain’, originally published in 1778, in which Tasker presents the Bards as divinely inspired figures whose role was to ‘Inspire the sons of Mars in dreams, | And fire their souls in warlike themes’.152 But the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott. (P. 53)
A bold claim!!! Is it also possible that a reprinting offers something important that contemporary poetry does not…?

While this opening chapter has looked at a wide range of examples, subsequent chapters will focus more closely on particular writers and texts produced at key moments of crisis or emergency to show how poetry was conceived and employed as a vital form in representing and imagining war and how the conflict with France shaped the self-conceptions of individual poets as well as broader formulations of the function of poetry itself. The next three chapters will look at the issue of the poetic (p.54) role in wartime in the writing of four of the major poets of the opening decade of the conflict, Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. Chapter 2 argues that Smith and Coleridge responded to wartime moments of crisis (the declaration of war and the invasion threat respectively) by making the imagining of the conflict a crucial function of their poetry and a key element of their identities as writers. Chapter 3 examines how Southey and Wordsworth defined their poetic identities in relation to war, war poetry, and each other during the years 1798–1802, while Chapter 4 argues that in his political sonnets of 1802–3, written during the invasion crisis, Wordsworth reconceived his poetic role, and poetry and the nation more generally, as ‘manly’. Chapter 5focuses on Walter Scott, who transformed the poetic imagining of war during the conflict (and for a century to come), shifting the emphasis from war’s horrors to its picturesque excitements in his metrical romances. The influence of this transformation of war is examined in Chapter 6 which examines the way in which the dominant new understanding of the war as romance was deployed and resisted in poems written on the Peninsular War by Felicia Hemans, Lord Byron, and Robert Southey, as well as by Scott himself. The final chapter will look at two poets writing in the decade after Waterloo whose identities were shaped by their sense of themselves as war poets, Byron and Hemans, and argue that looking back on the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars they find in the siege a figure for the total and dominating conflict that defined the age through which they had lived.

Charlotte Smith’s reconception of the role of ‘fancy’ in her blank-verse poem The Emigrants, begun during peacetime but completed in April 1793, two months after France’s declaration of war on Britain, forcefully illustrates the way in which the outbreak of war led one of the most popular and influential writers of the closing decades of the eighteenth century to transform her ideas of the imagination and to reconceive her poetic role. Smith begins the poem, with a model of fancy as a delusive power to which women are especially vulnerable, a continuation of her conception of it in Elegiac Sonnets. But. the encounter of her poetic persona with the figures of war in boo-k II forces a reassessment of the poetics of sensibility that had characterized the collection of poems which had made her famous. Moving away from a poetics which finds its metaphors for the self in the suffering other, in The Emigrants Smith presents the victims of war as beyond the limits of suffering known to either her persona or to the British public, all of whom are ‘safe’ from the conflict, ‘by the rude sea guarded’ (II. 210).1 It is through imagining war in poetry, and insisting on the public’s imagining of war, that the poet can bring the war home to the reading public and bring the conflict to an end. In conceiving of the wartime role of the imagination in this way, Smith transforms the function of a faculty that was becoming particularly associated with women (p.56) and constructs her poetic role as specifically feminine, finding her model for the poet in the figure of the mother.

writing five years later in ‘Fears in Solitude’ Samuel Taylor Coleridge addresses, what he sees as a national failure to imagine the war. Like Smith in The Emigrants, in ‘Fears in Solitude’ the poet addresses a nation distant from the scene of conflict—’Secure from actual warfare’ (l. 88)2—and, like her, he ultimately offers his own imagining as a model for the nation. But while Smith represents her imaginative powers through the feminine figure of the mother, the Coleridgean poet is a specifically masculine figure, mature and paternal If in Smith’s text the imagining of conflict will lead to war’s extinction, Coleridge’s poem is driven by an opposition between the poet’s imagining of war and the nation’s failure to do so that threatens, to bring ‘actual warfare’ to Britain. While ‘Fears in Solitude” emphasizes the challenge of war to the poet and war’s role in the development (and remasculinization) of this figure, it also occupies a place as an important document in the evolution of Coleridge’s ideas about the imagination, A text which supports Nigel Leask’s ‘demand of Imagination’ that it occupy ‘a position of accountability in the practical realm’,3 ‘Fears in Solitude” illustrates the political function that Coleridge outlined, for the imagination in much of his writing of the 1790s. Yet in creating an opposition between the ‘imagined’ and the ‘actual’, Coleridge was establishing the framework for his influential post-Waterloo accounts of the imagination, the poet, and the absolute genius which would detach them from the world of “realities’. The imagining of war, then, plays a major role in the development of the romantic imagination. (P. 56)

Smith develops this concern with fancy in book I of The Emigrants, her two-book blank-verse poem which, describes the encounter on the south coast of Britain, of her poetic persona with various religions and aristocratic exiles from revolutionary France, Smith began the poem in 1792,7 three years after the publication of her sonnet, and throughout book I emphasizes the delusive nature of fancy which she associates with women, especially a series of mother figures and her own poetic persona. (P. 58)

It is the demands of war on Smith as a poet that leads her to redeem fancy in book II of The Emigrants and to reconstruct her poetic identity and role’ France declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793 and, by positioning the two books, of The Emigrants either side of this date, Smith emphasizes how the change in historical moment from book I to book II is crucial to her poetic reconceptions. Whereas book I is set on ‘a Morning in November, 1792’ (p. 135), book II is dated ‘an afternoon in April, 1793’ (p-149); and while the events of war that Smith describes in book II are those of the civil war in France of the previous year, 1792—‘The Summer past’’ (II. 213)—as described by the emigrants, it is Britain’s entry into the war that leads to the change of emphasis, No longer a poem about exile, in book. II The Emigrants becomes a poem about war (a shift emphasized by the epigraph from Virgil (p. 149)) and Smith constructs a very different model of the role of fancy in response to this changed context.

In The Emigrants Smith puts her faith in the émigrés’ first-hand accounts of the war to provide the basis for her own and her readers’ imaginings of conflict. Her attachment of detailed prose footnotes to her poetic pictures of the war seeks to further emphasize the accuracy of her text’s representations of the events of summer 1792.13 However, to guarantee the impact of her recounted depictions of war on her readership, Smith frames them through cultural forms that evoke an emotional response enacted by her poetic persona. (P. 63)

Smith’s depictions of ‘savage War’ in these pictures and tales culminate in a daring and powerful denunciation of ‘the closet murderers’ whom we style | Wise Politicians’ (II. 320–1 ) and the polemical nature of her poem is suggested by her use of the phrase ‘plunder’d peasants’ in her description of the pictures of war (II. 229). When in 1797 the Anti-Jacobin outlined the favoured topics of Jacobin poetry, it commented that ‘we are presented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered peasants, and deserted looms’.15 While the Anti-jacobin may not have had The Emigrants specifically in its sights here (though I have not found the phrase elsewhere), its use of the phrase does locate Smithes text within a political poetics that the periodical sought to counter and which it strikingly sees as characterized by its emphasis on the physical damage of war. (P 64)

While Smith’s quotation from Gray’s ‘Elegy’ emphasizes both her poetic-identity and the- role of sensibility in her work, she here insists on sensibility being directed away from ‘selfish sufferings’.16  (p. 65)

But. six months after she-had completed The Emigrants, the nature of her relation with the war would again change, and with it her sense of the authority of her poetic role, For on 6 September 1793 her seventh, son Charles, an. ensign in the Bedfordshires, was wounded during the Duke of York’s campaign on the borders of France and Holland.17 (p. 66)

‘Written in. April 1798, During the Alarm of an Invasion’, as its subtitle announces, ‘Fears in Solitude’ has long been regarded as one of the (p.68) crucial accounts of Coleridge’s shifting response to the war with France, with the strident anti-war poet, lecturer, and journalist of the mid-ijgos seeking to realign his political position as a result of international developments, especially the French occupation of Switzerland in early 1798, itself the subject of Coleridge’s ‘The Recantation: An Ode’, published in the same quarto pamphlet by Joseph Johnson.22 Yet while a poem of political crisis on both international and personal levels’ ‘Fears in Solitude’ is also a poem which presents the threat of invasion as at least in part the product of a poetic crisis, and. specifically a national failure of imagination and feeling. Like Charlotte Smith, Coleridge identifies the separation of the British public from the scene of war as crucial to their response to it (p. 67-8)

As Coleridge argued in a piece entitled ‘Insensibility of the Public Temper’ in the Morning Post in February 1798, the familiarity of European, events to the reading public meant that their impact on the imagination had lessened: ‘What is familiar to the imagination ceases to-be terrible; and what ceases to be terrible we no longer feel a strong inducement to resist’ (EoT, I. 22), (p 69)

The euphemistic language of war has become detached from what. Coleridge elsewhere terms ‘realities’, realities registered here through the physical damage to the soldier’s body, the emotional response of the widow (a variation of a figure previously used in ‘On the Present War’ and ‘Religious Musings’)25 and through divine Judgement. (P. 70)

Like Smith, Coleridge imagines war through the figure of the fleeing widow and baby, but whereas for Smith such a. scene was unimaginable in Britain, in 1793, except as an. imagining, for Coleridge the feared invasion threatens to turn a literary trope into a reality in his native isle. (P. 73)

Writing in the 1790s, Charlotte Smith and Samuel Taylor Coleridge both offer the imaginative poet as a model for the nation’s response to war, and their detailed poetic examinations of the functions and effects of the imagination reveal the extent to which they saw this faculty as having an essentially political function, contrary to influential accounts of the imagination which see it as transcending, compensating for, or displacing, the political.38 Yet paradoxically ‘Fears in Solitude’ can also (p.78) be seen as a text which begins the detaching of the imaginative from the political on which such later accounts are built For while Coleridge could appeal to the nation’s ‘truth-painting Imagination’ in his 1795 slave-trade lecture, ‘Fears in Solitude’ distinguishes between the poet’s imagining of the war and the nation’s failure to do so. The poem differentiates the poet from the rest of the nation and establishes an imaginary world created by him and peopled by the creatures of his imagination

Coleridge’s definition of the faculties of the poet remain much the same as in the 1790s, but if in that decade feeling and imagination were the base of his politics, twenty years later they have become entirely separate from it. While the poet’s imagination (or ‘fancy’, as it is now) continues to paint, it is no longer ‘truth-painting’ and its images would no longer be confirmed by the fleshly eye; indeed the very power of the poetry is proof of the lack of observation of war. Rather than the poem having its origin in ‘realities’, it is the poet and his ‘seething imagination’ who becomes its source, in an anticipation of Abrams’s expressive model of romantic poetry.43 In this ‘Preface’, Coleridge completes one of the major transformations of the imagination in the romantic period, but even while seeking to discredit and disclaim his earlier construction of his poetic identity, his account, emphasizes the extent to which his highly influential ideas about poetry and imagination were formulated in relation to the era of war in which, he lived. (P.79)

———

IN ROBERT SOUTHEY’S blank-verse poem ‘History’, written between mid-1798 and early 1799, the poet asks himself the repeated, question ‘Was it for this …?’1 Examining the development of his ‘young mind’ and ‘swelling heart’ and his aspirations to ‘love | his fellow kind’, the troubled writer finds himself confronted by the ‘crimes’ of history and calls on ‘gentle Poesy’ to receive him from, scenes such as ‘the fields of war’ so that he may ‘nurse | My nature’s, better feelings, for my soul | Sickens at man’s misdeeds’ (II. 1–8). This familiar narrative of an overwhelming sense of personal and political crisis producing a turn away from ‘History’, often figured as here as a retreat to a bower, has been a major feature of accounts of canonical romanticism, and still holds considerable sway. (P. 80)

It seems likely that Southey and Wordsworth drew on the same sources in Ariosto, Milton, Thomson, and Pope for the phrase “Was it for this …?’ but less certain is whether either knew of the other’s use of it in their contemporaneous explorations of poetic identity. (P. 81)

Wordsworth was probably the first to use the formula, beginning his first draft of The Prelude with the phrase in October 1798 in Goslar.5 Southey’s poem was published in January 1799 and the evidence of his Common-Place Book suggests it was written shortly before this, though in later editions he dated it to Westbury 1798, which would mean it could have been written any time after June 1798.6 At 31 lines to The Prelude’s eventual 8,000, ‘History’ may seem more like a reductio ad absurdum of Wordsworth’s epic than a genuine answer to it, but it does offer a manifesto for a different poetic mode to the one normally defined as romantic, one that is politically committed and speaks with what Southey terms in another poem of 1798 ’the calm, collected public voice’.7 (p. 82)

If Southey’s poem opens by establishing an opposition between two kinds of writing’History’s ‘Chronicle’ and the strains of ‘poesy’, only to collapse that distinction in his own historically inspired song, this opening opposition invokes and parodies the way poetry was often feminized in the writing of the 1790s as a trembling or timid Muse who turns away from the subject of ‘war, horrid war’, seeking like the poet of ‘History’ the shelter of the bower, removed from ‘the court’s polluted scenes, … dungeon horrors, … [and] … the fields of war’ (II 4–5). This chapter will examine the way in which Southey and Wordsworth responded to the war in their poetry and show how the war played a major role in the shaping of their poetic identities. (P. 82)

These developments in Wordsworth’s writing, particularly as they affected the relationship between his poetic role and his response to the figures of war, can be examined through a discussion of one of his encounters with history in ‘The Discharged Soldier’, a blank-verse fragment describing an incident that probably took place in 1788 and that Wordsworth would later include in book IV of The Prelude.26 Written in 1798, the year Southey’s encounter with history in the form of Clio prompted his poetic rededkation, Wordsworth’s encounter also produced a moment of poetic dedication, but one in which ‘History’ remains an other that troubles the poet’s sense of vocation. Wordsworth represents the experience of war through encounter and tale-telling, as his wandering poetic persona, on turning a corner, finds ‘Presented to my view an uncouth shape’, who he later sees is ‘clad in military garb’ (II. 38, 54).27 Like the figures of war in Wordsworth’s earlier poetry and like the many returning soldiers of the newspaper and magazine poetry discussed, in the opening chapter, the soldier tells his tale:
	•	when erelong
	•	I asked his history, he in reply
	•	Was neither slow nor eager, but unmoved,
	•	And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,
	•	A stalely air of mild indifference,
	•	He told a simple fact: that he had been
	•	A Soldier, to the tropic isles had gone,
	•	Whence he had landed now some ten days past;
	•	That on hts landing he had been dismissed,
	•	And with the little strength he yet had left
	•	Was travelling to regain his native home.   (II. 94–104)

(p.89) The soldier’s history is a familiar one, and Toby R. Benis has given, a powerfully contextualized reading of the poem as one that ‘criticizes Britain’s leaders’. seeing the soldier as a figure ‘whose sickly condition and wanderings are direct products of government policy and military service’.28 Yet in the context of the newspaper and magazine verse on wounded and returning soldiers, what is striking in Wordsworth’s presentation of the soldier’s telling of his tale is its lack of political and polemical force and its failure to produce the conventional poetic responses of sympathy or indignation on the part of the poet, In its attack on the Jacobin Poet in the second issue of 27 November 1797, the Anti-Jacobin had criticized the political use of sensibility ‘by-many authors … in sonnets and elegies without end’, giving an outline of the standard poetic techniques used by the writers of such verse:
A human being, in the lowest state of penury and distress, is a treasure to a reasoner of this cast. He contemplates, he examines, he turns him in every possible light, with, a view of extracting from the variety of his wretchedness new topics of invective against the pride of property. He indeed (if he is a true Jacobin), refrains from relieving the object of his compassionate contemplation; as well knowing, that every diminution from the general mass of human misery, must proportionally diminish the force of his argument29

In his treatment of the discharged soldier, it is as if the Wordsworthian narrator is responding to this attack, recommending that he accompany the soldier to the dwelling of a labourer who ‘will give you food if food you need, | And lodging for the night’ (II. 114–15). And reinforcing the soldier’s failure to fulfil the polemical and emotive role that would be allotted to him in political poetry, the poet again questions him about his ‘history’, this time providing him with a veritable checklist of the radical agenda of anti-war poetry:
	•	While thus we travelled on I did not fail
	•	To question him of what he had endured
	•	From, war and battle and the pestilence.   (II. 137–9)

But again the soldier’s answer fails to produce the ‘topics of invective’ we have seen in other treatments of the figure: (p.90)
	•	He all the while was in demeanor calm,
	•	Concise in answer: solemn and sublime
	•	He might have seemed, but that in all he said
	•	There was a strange half-absence and a tone
	•	Of weakness and indifference, as of one
	•	Remembering the importance of his theme,
	•	But feeling it no longer.   (II. 140–6)

The soldier’s delivery of his tale, like the fact that ‘He appeared | To travel without pain’ (II. 122–3), undermines the poet’s expectation that he would encounter one of the physically damaged victims of war, akin to Robert Merry’s ‘The Wounded Soldier’, discussed in Chapter 1. The normal ‘feeling’ response to tales of war is blocked by the poet’s sense that the soldier himself no longer ‘feels’ the importance of his theme and rather than producing expressions of just indignation against contending governments the encounter leads only to silence (II. 149).

Southey’s and Wordsworth’s poetic, encounters with ‘History’ in 1798, in the forms of Clio and the discharged soldier, exemplify the developments (p.92) of their poetic identities, evolving out of and continuing to inform their treatment of the figures of war. Their different trajectories as poets and their contrasting poetic responses to the war can be traced through their poetic dialogue over the next few years. While Southey reviewed Lyrical Ballads for the Critical Review in 1798, mo-re revealing of his response to the collection and to Wordsworth’s poetry of the late 1790s in general were the many poems he wrote in 1798 and 1799 which directly echo and rewrite Wordsworth’s published and unpublished poetry of the period.35 As Mary Jacobus has argued, these borrowings should not be seen as plagiarism but as ‘a deliberate attempt [by Southey] to put right what he had criticized in his review’, restoring the Ballads to the context from which they had been taken, replacing what Jacobus terms their new sophistication, oddity, arnbitiousness, imagination, universality, and symbolism with topicality, simplicity, and familiarity.36 Developing Jacobus’s argument, I think Southey’s rewritings of Lyrical Ballads counters what I have been arguing is one of the fundamental manœuvres that characterizes the development of Wordsworthian romanticism, the shift from a polemical humanitarian concern with suffering individuals to a psychological interest in their state of mind. Instead, Southey writes history back into Lyrical Ballads. (P. 91-2)

Wordsworth had himself subscribed to the fifth edition, of Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets of 178937 and ironically, given his failure to acknowledge her influence over his own sonnets in the account of 1843, he described Smith in 1835 as ‘a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered’.38 (p. 108)

——

Epilogue:

ADAM FERGUSON’S READING of The Lady of the Lake to ‘the rough sons of the Fighting Third Division’, with which this book began, and Felicia Hernam’s poetic imagining of war in response to the ‘magic page’ of The Talisman, with which it has ended, illustrate the centrality of Walter Scott’s writing to the envisioning of conflict during the romantic period. While the popularity of Scott’s metrical romances was superseded by the phenomenal sales of Byron’s poetry and his own success as a novelist in the years after the war, his reimagining of war remained tremendously influential throughout the nineteenth century, playing a major role in the chivalric revival, in the elevation of the warrior to heroic status, and in the romanticization of war that Michael Paris has seen as defining the ‘warrior nation’ from 1850 to 2000.1 For example, Scott’s description of the battle of Flodden in Marmion continued to be regarded by many as the greatest ever battle poem throughout the nineteenth century. In 1833, W. B. O. Peabody described the ‘glorious battle scene’ as ‘one of the finest passages of narrative poetry in the language’,2 while in the 1880s John Ruskin assessed it as ‘the truest and grandest battle-piece that, so far as I know, exists in the whole compass of literature’, adding in a note: ‘I include the literature of all foreign languages, so far as known to me: there is nothing to approach the finished delineations and flawless majesty of conduct in Scott’s Flodden’.3 Indeed, (p.226) Marmion became the benchmark for assessing all poetic accounts of war. Thomas Hardy once responded to criticism of Homer’s Iliad, Oh, but I admire the Iliad greatly. Why, it’s in the Marmion class!’4
The continued influence of Scott’s poetry on the imagining of conflict can be felt in verses written at the opening of the First World War» such as Julian Grenfell’s ‘Into Battle’ with its emphasis on ‘the joy of battle’ and Herbert Asquith’s ‘The Volunteer’ with its portrayal of a clerk fearing that ‘his days would drift away | With no lance broken in life’s tournament’,5 And the attacks of the poets of that war on the idealization of conflict were in part a response to a verse tradition, as well as a broader cultural movement, that can be traced back to Scott. For example, when Siegfried Sassoon condemns the conception of the war as romance in ‘Glory of Women’—’you believe | That chivalry redeems the war’s disgrace’6—he does so by invoking and undermining a typically chivalric moment in The Lord of the Isles when the King sends his cavalry into battle:
	•	‘Forward, each gentleman and knight!
	•	Let gentle blood show generous might,
	•	And chivalry redeem the fight!’ (VI. 24)

And Scott’s influential transformation of the imagining of war was not limited to Great Britain. In Life on the Mississippi (1883), Mark Twain diagnosed the ‘Sir Walter disease’ which infected the Southern states of America prior to the American Civil War through Scott’s creation of a ‘Middle-Age sham civilization’ (while Twain’s particular target is the novel Ivanhoe, his account of Scott refers equally to the poetry).7 The ‘Sir Walter disease’ attacked the imaginative self-conception of Scott’s readers» turning many of them into warriors (as the Eclectic Review argued Scott’s poetry had done to his British readers). Twain writes that ‘It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major or a Colonel, or a General or a Judge, before the war’ (469) and that ‘Sir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the war, (p.227) that he is in great measure responsible for the war’ (469). While Twain qualifies this argument by describing it as a ‘wild proposition’, it remains one for which ‘something of a plausible argument might» perhaps» be made’ (469). And Twain concludes by restating his argument, commenting that ‘The change of Character [responsible for the war] can be traced rather more easily to Sir Walter’s influence than to that of any other thing or person’ (469). Scott’s influence was such» Twain argues, that he can be held responsible for the American Civil War. While Twain symbolically enacted the end of Scott’s influence in Huckleberry Finnwhen he named the wrecked steamboat the Walter Scoff»8 it was the First World War which marked the culmination and the conclusion of the cult of chivalry and of Scott’s century of influence. But to borrow the formula of Twain’s ‘wild proposition’, in his poetry Scott transformed the writing of conflict during the Napoleonic wars and it is to the influence of Walter Scott» more than to that of any other thing or person» that we can trace the changed imagining of war in the nineteenth century.

            <Text>“To hear Charlotte Smith talk about her writing, you would think she was a drudge or even a hack, ‘compelled,’ as she now famously put it, ‘to live only to write &amp; write only to live’ … Except that she is continually ordering or borrowing books… she seems to have her nose to a grindstone and her eyes shut to all literary value. … one suddenly discovers someone who is reading every principal piece of literature available and commenting sharply on the success or lack thereof of many contemporary productions.” (Curran 175)

“If we want to know about Charlotte Smith’s views as a literary critic… we must turn to her novels and poems, where she holds almost obsessive dialogue with other literature.” (175)

“In English she returns again and again to Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Thomson, Gray, Collins, Goldsmith, Sterne, and, her favourite contemporary poet, William Cowper. Among French writers her taste is highly eclectic, though she returns often to La Rouchefoucauld, Rousseau, and, especially, Voltaire… Her Italian favourites are Petrarch’s sonnets and Mestasio’s operatic arias… She knows no German, but is keenly aware of the distinctive place occupied by Goethe’s Werther in the literature of sensibility. There is one other literature in which she is not only proficient but, for a woman author, surprisingly forthcoming: Latin. She certainly admires Cicero, Horace, and Ovid, but she reserves a special place for Virgil.” (Curran 176)

For the first time in one volume we read of her as novelist, poet, playwright, letter-writer — and literary icon, gaining and then losing a posthumous identity through how others wrote about her. Perhaps because of the ways in which she has subsequently been recovered — moving from minor novelist and pre-Romantic poet to proto-feminist ‘personal is political’ figurehead, to central 1790s novelist and essential Romantic poet — Smith occupies several different rhetorical positions. This can be seen, for example, in how the several editors of her novels and poetry have read and presented her, as well as how she writes and presents herself. Smith, significantly, composes herself anew according to genre; readers both recognize and complicate this process.” (2)

“Very few Smith scholars work actively on both the novels and the poetry, and consequently we have been learning about two separate Smiths, each closely linked to the genre she writes in, neither closely linked to the other. Because the novel during the Romantic period is undergoing an extraordinary amount of change and innovation, as it moves closer to its modern form, editors of the novels (myself included) tend to focus on Smith’s techniques and innovations, her use of tropes and themes, her facility with genres and description. Conversely, because Romantic poetry in the Smithian tradition is so closely tied up with explorations of selfhood and subjectivity, memory and a personalized past, editors of the poetry tend to present it as reflective of a personalized state of mind, of ‘woman’s’ experience, treating its manifold themes and narratives as, finally, reducible to and manifested from Smith’s life. Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres? Genre, it seems, carries a greater force in constructing our preconceptions of identity than has been recognized, and Smith is a case in point, a case we can crack by studying closely Smith’s style and techniques across genres.” (Labbe 5)

“In its fourteen essays, this collection illustrates Smith’s depth and versatility as an author. It offers varied and astute readings of her work as deeply informed by history, culture, and politics, and through Behrendt’s and Duckling’s essays on her posthumous reputation and her literary afterlives, it shows how Smith’s centrality transmuted into a marginality derived from cultural insistences on seeing her as a woman who wrote, rather than a writer who was female. Countering the few lingering descriptions of Smith as obscure or minor, the essays in this volume aptly demonstrate how seriously scholars need to treat her work, and how vital and central she is to our understanding of British Romanticism.” (10)</Text>

Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what are now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.</Text>

The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!
Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

            <Title>Farmer &amp; Lesser 2 Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade</Title>
            <Text>“So the debate centers not on facts or figures but rather on a more fundamental issue: how to theorize the meaning of *popularity* in the book trade and, specifically, how to interpret the relationship between market share and reprint rates when assessing popularity. We developed the concept of *structures of popularity* because we believe that these two criteria should be considered in dynamic relation to each other, to total number of editions, and to profitability. Blayney, on the other hand, argues that the total number of editions (and thus the market share) of sermon-books "completely vitiates" the usefulness of playbook reprint rates as an index of popularity.” (207)

“we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

"a reprint indicates that the previous edition had sold out (or was about to sell out) and that the publisher anticipated enough continuing demand to justify a further edition. The reprint rate for an entire class of books tells us how frequently a given title within that class achieved this type of economic success and, consequently, how often a publisher had the chance to enjoy the increased profits possible with reprint editions. Reprint rates, therefore, allow us to auge both the demand among retail customers for certain classes of books and the investment risk faced by speculating publishers.” (208)

Need to look at reprint rates, not just total number of reprints; playbooks twice as likely to be reprinted, even though there were twice as many second-ed sermon books

"Readers interested in how the chi-square test is performed can consult &lt;http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/ballc/webtools/web_chi.html or any introductory statistics textbook.” (209)

Blayney's semi-bad-faith argument about Tomkis v Shakespeare turns out to be solved with chi-square test -- samples are too small for variation to be statistically significant

"What the comparison of playbooks and sermon-books reveals is that neither market share nor reprint rates tells the entire story of ‘popularity’.
Thus while we agree with Blayney about the facts concerning the market shares of sermon-books and playbooks, we differ over how those facts relate to reprint rates and to ‘popularity' in the book trade.” (211)

“...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low.” (213)

“An approach based on structures of popularity this attempts not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (213)</Text>

            <Title>inclusion/exclusion in canons</Title>
            <Text>“Smith aspired to a place in posterity, but her contemporary success failed to secure her a place within the newly-emerging national canon. Whilst the absence of women poets from our literary histories has been a ubiquitous complaint, Smith was not entirely forgotten: her contribution was assessed in a variety of nineteenth-century anthologies, dictionaries and celebrations of ‘lost’ female talent. This essay will evaluate Charlotte Smith within these publications to reveal her colourful fate in posterity.” (Duckling 203)

“Smith was excluded from Housman’s A Collection of English Sonnets (1835) on the grounds that her sonnets were ‘mawkish effusions’.” (Duckling 205)

“Because traditional literary history has customarily privileged male writers at the expense of female ones, for much of the last century and a half Smith (like many other women) was routinely relegated to the margins when she was remembered at all. Thus William Lisle Bowles was widely credited with resurrecting the sonnet with the publication of his Fourteen Sonnets in 1789, a misperception to which Coleridge perhaps unintentionally contributed in the Biographia Literaria, where he praises those sonnets without mentioning Smith, whose own sonnets predated Bowles’s by some five years and demonstrably influenced them. At the time, thought, many writers saw matters correctly” (Behrendt 196)
“Not surprisingly, few authors of the period wrote in much detail about Smith’s direct influences upon their works, although it is clear from sonnets like Bowles’s, Coleridge’s, Wordsworth’s, Opie’s, Hanson’s, Dark’s, Keats’s, and even Anna Seward’s that her influence was wide, formative, and powerful, just as it was in prose fiction for novelists like Austen, Radcliffe, Opie, Scott and others. Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain), while there is no question that her life itself continued to hold real interest for many — and especially for many women — in the first several decades following her death.” (Behrendt 201).

“In English she returns again and again to Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Thomson, Gray, Collins, Goldsmith, Sterne, and, her favourite contemporary poet, William Cowper. Among French writers her taste is highly eclectic, though she returns often to La Rouchefoucauld, Rousseau, and, especially, Voltaire… Her Italian favourites are Petrarch’s sonnets and Mestasio’s operatic arias… She knows no German, but is keenly aware of the distinctive place occupied by Goethe’s Werther in the literature of sensibility. There is one other literature in which she is not only proficient but, for a woman author, surprisingly forthcoming: Latin. She certainly admires Cicero, Horace, and Ovid, but she reserves a special place for Virgil.” (Curran 176)
— Cf Guillory: she OUGHT to be succeeding on all the metrics for cultural capital, but gets left behind when we change those metrics..?

“In its fourteen essays, this collection illustrates Smith’s depth and versatility as an author. It offers varied and astute readings of her work as deeply informed by history, culture, and politics, and through Behrendt’s and Duckling’s essays on her posthumous reputation and her literary afterlives, it shows how Smith’s centrality transmuted into a marginality derived from cultural insistences on seeing her as a woman who wrote, rather than a writer who was female. Countering the few lingering descriptions of Smith as obscure or minor, the essays in this volume aptly demonstrate how seriously scholars need to treat her work, and how vital and central she is to our understanding of British Romanticism.” (10)

“As Mary Poovey has argued, the ultimate effect of the revolutionary decade was to set women on their journey towards the ‘Victorian pedestal’, as increasingly idealized imaged of femininity took hold: female artists were expected to embody purity and goodness in their art and in their lives. Concurrently, women writers were being marginalized by what Gary Kelly has described as a ‘remasculinization’ of literature and culture.” (Duckling 208) Smith stopped being anthologized as a poet, and entered anthologies as a poetess.
Brydges and Barbauld anthologize/praise Smith as an artist in a mixed-gender field 1808-1810 (though still in gendered terms). This shifts: Dyce (1825) and Rowton (1848) and Bethune (1848) and Adams (1857) anthologize in separate women-only collections, praising both her art and her life. Women anthologize her differently: Elwood (1843), Williams (1861), and Kavanagh (1862) see more literary importance.
“From a critical perspective, Charlotte Smith lost intellectual ground by the end of the nineteenth century, but women’s poetry was still a commercial venture and her poems frequently appeared in popular anthologies.” (Duckling 216). But Robertson’s 1883 poetesses anthology dismisses the poetry as unpleasant to read, even though Smith was admirable.
More recent critical history: “In the early twentieth century, critical accounts focused on Smith’s contributions to the novel. In 1913, Saintsbury believed Smith was ‘something of a person in herself, but less of a figure in history, because she neither innovates nor does old things consummately.’ Even the first extensive study of Smith by Florence Hilbish, whilst highlighting many areas of innovation, arrived at the conclusion that she produced ‘little strikingly original’ material … the twentieth century was not yet ready to truly appreciate Charlotte Smith. This is evident in Ernest Bernbaum’s / indifferent review of Hilbish’s work, which concluded that ‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable.’
The feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s generated a surge of interest in women’s writing, predominantly focused on the novel. Simultaneously, a revived interest in the historical context of literature enabled Bishop Hunt to demonstrate the influence of Smith on Wordsworth in 1970, although Smith remained a minor poet. By the 1980s the situation was changing rapidly. Perhaps this is because, in many respects, the critical climate began to reflect the same cultural preoccupations of Smith’s own age: a fascination with recovering the poetry of the past, a market predisposed to female anthologies and biographies, and a feminist interest in the plight of the woman in history. Smith had maintained a place in the popular female histories and collections in the nineteenth century, and had begun to be taken seriously by the academy in the twentieth century. In the 1990s, however, Smith enjoyed a popularity matched only during her own lifetime, with three separate reprints of the Elegiac Sonnets appearing during that decade. With the scholarship of Stephen Curran, and the academic anthologies of Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, and Andrew Ashfield (amongst numerous others), Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism. This is most clearly exemplified in the recent appearance of Jacqueline Labbe’s monograph on Smith, which explores Smith’s work beyond the constraints of gender and establishes her as a major influence on Wordsworth. As our definitions of Romanticism have been radically redefined, Smith may have finally achieved the winning combination of popularity and posterity.” (Duckling 216-217)</Text>

            <Title>Gamer, Michael</Title>
            <Text>“Privileging one kind of writing, however ‘‘invisibly,’’ means demoting others linked closely enough to it to be perceived as viable substitutes.” (Gamer 7)

“Rather, then, than echoing Anne Williams’s argument that ‘‘ ‘Gothic’ and ‘Romantic’ are not two but one’’30 because of their shared poetics, I wish to focus upon the economic and ideological processes that have insured their lasting separation.” (Gamer 10)

“As Jon Klancher has argued persuasively, reviewers and readers hardly constituted homogeneous, let alone mutually exclusive, groups.17 Yet the relevance of Jauss’s strata does not lie in the accuracy with which they represent actual British readers or reading habits, but rather in the uncanny resemblance those conceptual catego- ries bear to the similarly imprecise ideas that late-eighteenth-century British writers and reviewers held about the makeup of their own readership.18          This imprecise knowledge of fellow readers has been confirmed in recent scholarly research on literacy and reading habits at the end of the eighteenth century – research that has characterized British culture as experiencing exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences.19 Few conservative prose writers in the s, for example, display an informed awareness of this new diversity of readership beyond making increasingly anxious calls to police the reading of women and adolescents and to contain the circulation of radical texts like The Rights of Man (). (32)

“Both Fergus’s and Kaufman’s findings concerning the readership of fiction suggest statistically about gothic readers what Austen’s Henry Tilney here embodies: that men ‘‘read nearly as many as women,’’ and that gothic fiction attracted educated and elite readers capable not only of understanding irony but also of treating their own reading experience with it. For Austen, as for Kaufman and Fergus, the actual gothic reader has little in common with the ‘‘young ladies and . . . luckless reviewers’’ assumed by the Monthly and other Reviews to be the only readers of gothic fiction. That Austen raises and explodes this assumption about the gender and level of education of gothic readers twice in the same passage provides us with some sense of the prevalence of the stereotype and degree of irritation it caused her. Looking to Northanger’s famous passage defending novels, furthermore, the perpetuators of such a stereotype are equally clear: ‘‘Let us leave it to the Reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans.’’38 		These ‘‘threadbare strains’’ of ‘‘abuse,’’ and the effects that they had on other writers in the period, require further investigation and theoretical work. In writing prose fiction, Austen has little choice but to defend the novel against reviewers and to supplement their portrait of the naive female gothic reader (Catherine) with an older and more sophisticated counterpart (Henry). For a poet, dramatist, or learned editor, however, such a direct defense of – and association with – popular fiction is both unnecessary and, in the face of the repetitive vitriol and cliche ́s of eighteenth-century reviewing, undesirable. By the end of the eighteenth century, in fact, gothic reviewer–writer discourses have become so hyperbolic and so mechanistically conventional as to force us to re-examine their cultural function. Gothic writers and reviewers may ostentatiously speak to one another, but the utter sameness of their mutual addresses spurs us to ask for whom these authorial prefaces and critical reviews are intended, and where, if anywhere, communication exists in these discourses. Put another way, in discourses so predictable in their rhetoric and modes of address, why do gothic writers and reviewers write with so much energy?” (40)

“I wish to argue, however, that the ritualistic abuse of gothic writers by gothic reviewers involves more explicit acts of intimidation as well. Gothic reviewers most often attack individual gothic works, and gothic as a genre, not to remonstrate with gothic writers to write in other genres, but rather to make clear to other readers – and especially to other writers – the cultural costs of reading and writing gothic texts. However indirectly stated, this communication constitutes a palpable threat, and if gothic reviewers perform a specific kind of cultural work, it is to define and reiterate the risks of reading and writing gothic to those members of the British readership contemplating it. Looking back to the above-quoted review of The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, for example, gothic readers risk associating themselves with the ‘‘unformed mind[s]’’ of adolescents, with the ‘‘stupidity’’ of female ‘‘nonsense,’’ and with the vitiated tastes of readers for whom ‘‘wonders, and wonders only, can charm.’’ More seriously, gothic writers risk losing their cultural legitimacy, social respectability, and standing as serious authors. I read gothic’s critical reception, therefore, as a regulatory discourse – carried out under the fiction of paternalistic advice to a given gothic writer, but functioning as an implicit threat to other readers and writers potentially attracted to the gothic.” (42)

“At the end of the eighteenth century, gothic emerges next to, and comes to play a special role within, these larger debates about the utility and risks of reading in the absence of formal education and training. With Ian Duncan, Robert Miles, and Edward Jacobs, then, I read the emergence of gothic fiction between 1760 and 1790 as a response to the novel and as an attempt to align romance with the dignity of history and with the poetics of the medieval metrical romance and Shakespearean tragedy. ”(57)

“romance’s reception provided a language for reviewers to criticize gothic’s other perceived transgressions against existing literary and social codes: among them the need to keep genres ‘‘pure,’’ disciplinary boundaries distinct, and ‘‘better books’’ in appropriate hands” (51)</Text>

            <Title>ch 2 - fame and legacy</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “seriousness” of their reputations. Influenced by Ashley J. Cross’s “From Lyrical Ballads to Lyrical Tales: Mary Robinson's Reputation and the Problem of Literary Debt,” I am interested in exploring the careers of Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as my “case study” for this chapter. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for “popularity,” “celebrity,” and “legacy” which are both fruitful and nuanced. In addition to reading the extensive literature grappling with these concerns for individual authors, I am currently thinking of ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. I may also add scholarly uptake (perhaps through the proxy of  JSTOR articles, since JSTOR makes their archive accessible for experiments of this type) as a particular sub-type of “legacy.”</Text>

            <Text>Chapter 3 of this dissertation examines the works of Mary Robinson across several digital corpora. Mary Robinson is selected as a contemporary of Charlotte Smith’s with remarkably similar patterns of publication, but remarkably different reception. Mary Robinson’s first literary foray was the volume Poems by Mrs. Robinson, published by C. Parker in 1775, shortly followed by the poem Elegiac verses to a young lady on the death of her brother. “Though Poems received little critical support, and made little money, Mary Robinson continued to write” (Mark Ockerbloom), but she would begin her career as an actress before this writing saw publication. Robinson’s theatrical debut as Juliet in December 1776 led to an increasingly acclaimed and prolific acting career. In 1777 she published a volume of works written earlier, Captivity, A Poem: and Celadon and Lydia, A Tale, and in 1778 she wrote and starred in her own musical farce, The Lucky Escape, from which she published The Songs, Chorusses, etc. In 1780, Robinson retired from the stage. The next volume under her name did not appear until 1791, but the intervening decade was not empty of literary activity. From 1784 to its publication in 1787, Robinson collaborated with Banastre Tarleton on the composition and revision of his History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781. In 1788, Robinson began the writing which would make her career as an author. She contributed poems to The World and The Oracle under the pseudonyms “Laura” and “Laura Maria” which responded to popular poems by a coterie of writers now called the Della Cruscans, who addressed each other in periodicals with Miltonic, Italianate, and political poetry. Robinson’s poems successfully inserted herself into their conversation, prompting replies from the other poets. This dissertation’s decade of interest, 1789-99, captures Robinson’s most prolific period. Her 1790 poem Ainsi va le Monde, published under the pseudonym Laura Maria, was her breakout Della Cruscan poem. The success of her Della Cruscan poetry led to the publication in 1791 of another Poems by Mrs. Robinson, this time by J. Bell, as well as The Beauties of Mrs. Robinson, another collection of poetry. She also produced a pamphlet that year, Impartial Reflections on the Queen of France, under the name “a friend to humanity”. The next year, 1792, saw the arrival of a successful novel, Vancenza, or the Dangers of Credulity, which went through three editions in that year, and two elegiac poems. 1793 saw three more poems, two under her own name and one under the pseudonym “Horace Juvenal.” In 1794 she published her second novel, The Widow, or a Picture of Modern Times. In 1795 she published another novel, Audley Fortescue, under the name “Mr. Robinson.” In 1796 she published four major works: the novel Angelina; the novel Hubert de Sevrac; a sonnet series Sappho and Phaon; and the play The Sicilian Lover. The next year, 1797, saw two more novels: Julie St. Lawrence and Walsingham. 1798 was Robinson’s first year since 1790 with no publications, but in 1799, she perhaps made up for it by publishing two novels, The False Friend and The Natural Daughter, as well as a political treatise, A Letter to the Women of England on the Cruelties of Mental Subordination. She also began contributing weekly essays to the Morning Post and Gazetteer in 1799. After 1799 (and thus after this dissertation’s decade of interest), Robinson’s career and life is short. In 1800, she published her tenth novel, Ellinda; her verse collection Lyrical Tales in volume form as well as The Mistletoe, a Christmas Tale (as Laura Maria) in its own small book; and a translation from the German of Joseph Hager’s travel narrative A Picture of Palermo. Robinson died in December 1800. After her death, her daughter Mary Elizabeth Robinson oversaw the posthumous publication of three more works: Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself (1801), a collection of poetry titled The Wild Wreath (1804), and a final collection of The Poetical Works of the Late Mrs. Robinson (1806).</Text>

            <Text>It’s buying into Wordsworth’s weird aesthetic fetishization of poverty to say that a poor old man is defined by his struggle with a root and has nothing left after the wandering poet slices it for him. There is another root. There are a lot more roots. There are also clothes to wash and furniture to mend and a thousand, thousand other household labours, which his wife has been doing! If anything, the sadness of his gratitude is that, as the poet knows, cutting one root does nothing to change the actual condition of the man’s life.</Text>

            <Title>Rigby, Mair, Queer Theory's Debt to the Gothic</Title>
            <Text>“Since the advent of academic queer theory in the early 1990s, the proliferation of publications addressing queer reading possibilities in Gothic fiction suggest that Queer Studies and Gothic Studies may be considered complementary fields of inquiry.” (46)
“But thinking about the queer theorisation of the Gothic only in terms of what queer theory has done for Gothic Studies might be a limiting way of approaching the subject. As Michael O’Rourke and David Collings have observed, it is not simply the case that the Gothic is always already queer; queer theory is also always already Gothic. … It is sometimes all too easy to view theory as illuminating literary texts and, in this essay, I will propose that the Gothic has had an equal, if note more important, in enabling the production of queer critical narratives.” (46)
“Judith Halberstam, for instance, now more well-known for her work on transgender politics, published her first book on Gothic horror fiction. George Haggerty publishes on both the Gothic and the history of sexuality, bringing these concerns together in Queer Gothic. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, sometimes called ‘the queen of queer theory’, also began her scholarly career in the Gothic.” (47)
“Haggerty goes so far as to argue that the Gothic ‘offers a historical model of queer theory and politics: transgressive, sexually coded and resistant to dominant ideology.’” (47)
“In these textual worlds of excess and danger we find the institutions of family and marriage shaken, the representation of extreme states of being, encounters with outcast monsters, not to mention conventional preoccupations with forbidden knowledge, paranoia, madness, secrecy, and guilt.” (47)
“What strikes me in the relationship between queer theory and Gothic fiction is precisely the uncannily personal sense of identification with the Gothic that often underscores work on the subject. Sigmund Freud suggested that the uncanny is ‘something which is secretly familiar… which has undergone repression and then returned from it.’ When I say that queer scholarship’s encounter with the Gothic is ‘uncanny’, I mean that it appears to be based on a sense of a ‘secret encounter’ in which the texts bring to light something which ought to be repressed, something that feels particularly pertinent to people whose identities, bodies, and desires have been culturally designated ‘queer’.” (48)
A truly lengthy survey of queer work enabled by the Gothic!
“Although the Italian and Udolpho are not fully-fledged lesbian Gothics, they can be placed in a tradition of Female Gothic texts that utilise the uncanny to speak about the construction of desire between women. I recognise something in these novels which impels me to speak about lesbianism. … All these texts deploy the motif of recognition between women to uncanny effect, indicating awareness that although lesbianism has been constructed under heteropatriarchy as something that must be repressed at all costs, the possibility of desire between women stubbornly returns to haunt the cultural centre. In this respect, the Female Gothic has also enabled lesbian theorists, such as Palmer and Castle, to produce subversive critical narratives which reclaim the Female Gothic for lesbian and queer theory.” (54)
“Instead of viewing queer theory as liberating repressed sexual meaning in the Gothic, is is interesting to view the Gothic as enabling queer scholarship, helping theorists to articulate queer reading practices and discuss the construction of sexual nonconformity.” (54)
“Underscoring much queer-Gothic scholarship, including this essay, is a feeling that people constructed as ‘queer’ have a special relationship with the uncanny and, therefore, with the Gothic. The impression that repressed queer meaning has come to light produces the uncanny sense of recognition in the feeling that Gothic texts are speaking about ‘us’. But perhaps what is demonstrated in the Gothic is the extent to / which the rhetorical construction of sex and gender nonconformity has been mediated through the uncanny, in which case, what we really recognise is our own construction as uncanny beings, bodies of knowledge that ought to be repressed.” (54-55)
“I began to feel, in other words, distinctly ‘uncanny’. At the time, I made no connections between my own experiences and my avid consumption of Gothic and horror novels. Queer theory has brought me full circle, enabling me to recognise that what I recognise in the Gothic is the Gothic’s capacity to convey an uncanny sense of queer awareness.” (55)</Text>

            <Text>Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Jon Mee, Kevin Gilmartin and Paul Keen are others who would be important here. Plus scholars who focus more on conservatism, perhaps M. O. Grenby for example? Or even much earlier work by Marilyn Butler?
Per Terry’s suggestions, I would likely begin here with Jon Klancher, The Making of English Reading Audiences, 1790-1832; Marcus Wood, Radical Satire and Print Culture, 1790-1822; and David Worrall, Radical Culture: Discourse, Resistance, and Surveillance, 1790-1820. Other promising titles include Social networks in the long eighteenth century : clubs, literary salons, textual coteries, ed. Ileana Baird; and The enlightenment &amp; the book : Scottish authors &amp; their publishers in eighteenth-century Britain, Ireland &amp; America, by Richard B. Sher, to capture different parts of the publishing landscape.</Comments>

            <Text>My introduction will define the terms and concepts which the rest of the dissertation will use, paying particular attention to the parallel development of similar concerns in DH and non-DH fields. I will explicitly note that my DH methods align me with scholars in queer DH, and discuss some of the underlying assumptions of queer theory which shape my thinking: my aspiration is a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. The introduction will also address why I define my window of interest as 1789-99, and who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.
Vocabulary to be discussed:
	•	“Surface” reading vs “distant” reading (and, of course, their ties to close reading)
	•	Popularity, canon, marginalization
	•	My preferred DH terminology around modelling, sensitivity, and fruitfulness
The introduction will thus allow me to to deal directly with the way that other researchers in my fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address my questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading.

“The Cheap Repository has usually been discussed within the context of the turbulent politics of the 1790s and the resulting fears, on the part of the gentry and the aristocracy, of popular violence. Historians, from More's first biographer Henry Thompson to E. P. Thompson, have pointed to the publication of Painite pamphlets and the rioting of the 1790s as the catalyst of More's moralizing literature. J. L. and Barbara Hammond further identified More's writings as the ideological justification for the economic exploitation and formal political exclusion of the poor. Although some historians of the evangelical movement, Ford K. Brown in particular, have recognized that the tracts tried to reform the morals of the poor quite as much as their politics these writers have also stressed the loyalist content of the tracts, emphasizing their attempt to give religious sanction to the existing social order.” (Pederson 85)</Text>

            <Title>Mee: is LCS literature?</Title>
            <Text>John Mee: Print, Publicity, and Popular Radicalism in the 1790s. Although his title leaves open the possibility that he could consider any kind of writing in print, Mee is concerned solely with the activities of the London Corresponding Society, placed in the context of Romanticism. He examines “public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS’s name” (28). Mee sidesteps the question of whether the texts he studies are ‘literature.’ A partial claim to the status of ‘literature’ is suggested by the participation of his book within the series ‘Cambridge Studies in Romanticism,’ which, he acknowledges “implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of ‘literary’ culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies” (18). Nonetheless, the book distances itself from “Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights” (18). Mee thus replicates the way that the period’s definitely-literary “poets, novelists, and playwrights” sought to put distance between themselves and the potentially sub-literary “role of print personality as a form of mediation” (29) that interests Mee in the LCS.</Text>
            <Comments>“this formation and the associated identification of the literary with what John Thelwall called ‘sallies of the imagination’ were the product of a crisis brought on by the emergence of the popular radical culture opened up in this book, but the story is not a straightforward one. Thelwall himself could identify ‘literature’ both with a domain of imagination separable from politics and with print as the principal engine of emancipatory change.” (Mee 18)
By this, Mee means “both attacks on personalities by the radical press but also the development of personae by writers and booksellers” \cite{Mee:2016wk p.29}.</Comments>

            <Text>The crux of much of my distress: “Since noncanonical works are in every case either historical works (the objects of research or revaluation) or modern works (the objects for legitimation for the first time as cultural capital), they are in fact what all canonical works once were. To content otherwise is to commit oneself to the notion that some works are intrinsically canonical" (51)
"In the context of curricular revision, the category of the noncanonical loses its empty significance as merely the sum total of what is not included in the canon, and takes on a content specified by the contemporary critique: the noncanonical must be conceived as the /actively/ excluded, the object of a historical repression.” (9)
“the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.’ What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the /same way/ that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised.” (33)
Because the canon and the curriculum are not in fact identical, I can begin curricular reform without having to finish solving canonical reform.</Text>

            <Title>HathiTrust</Title>
            <Text>What makes Google Books of interest in the context of this dissertation is its relationship to HathiTrust, an increasingly popular resource for scholars. HathiTrust’s collection contains digitized content from “a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house member institution initiatives.” The “in-house member institutions” include one hundred and fifty-five universities, colleges, and consortia of universities. The aggregate scholarly authority of these institutions carries the weight of elevating HathiTrust above the Google Books scans which form the backbone of much of its contents: “The members ensure the reliability and efficiency of the digital library,” the website assures us, “by relying on community standards and best practices.” The texts themselves are stored in the database as facsimile page images and full-text OCR transcripts. In order to comply with copyright law, however, HathiTrust only provides large-scale downloads and OCR transcripts for texts which are in the public domain. Most scholars use HathiTrust to run experiments on OCR transcripts of copyrighted texts, which they can only access through computational workarounds that intentionally make it impossible for the scholar to see the full transcript itself. Through its collection, HathiTrust provides a hodgepodge of texts, of often unverifiable provenance and accuracy, selected largely by happenstance and convenience in a quest to contain all printed books. Through its tools, however, which provide a unique solution to real barriers for scholars of contemporary literature, and through its institutional affiliations, HathiTrust has acquired a cultural captal among scholars which Google Books still lacks.</Text>
            <Comments>For example, it might be able to acquire a text document with all of the words of a novel, but sorted into alphabetic order: such a text file can be used for some analyses based on word-frequency, but cannot be read. Or, it might be possible to find collocations of where a given word appears, but with only a limited number of words of context on either side of the term in question. Or, scholars can run pre-written code provided by HathiTrust to carry out things like topic modelling on the full, intact texts of their chosen works, but without being able to inspect those texts or run their own code on them. All of these modes of analysis make research much more difficult to carry out, and nearly impossible to verify. In the study of contemporary copyrighted literature, however, even these very limited tools for corpus analysis are valuable.</Comments>

            <Text>The first phase of this project takes up titles and databases. Throughout this work, a ‘title’ is the broadest possible umbrella term for a text: it is synonymous with ‘a database entry which I believe to represent a printed work.’ Each individual database will shape the precise correspondences between a ‘title’ and the printed texts about which I use ‘titles’ to reason. For example, it will vary based on my source whether multiple editions of the same work are several ‘titles’ or one ‘title,’ and whether the titles exclusively represent ‘books’ or also include chapbooks, broadsheets, or even ephemera. Due to the inscrutability of much digital infrastructure, a problem discussed above, it is often not possible for me to know prior to experimentation what kinds of titles I am working with. These variations form part of my object of inquiry.</Text>

            <Title>computation reveals assumptions</Title>
            <Text>Love’s later article, “Close Reading and Thin Description,” provides a more precise articulation of the kind of close reading that she calls for, in which an “exhaustive, fine-grained attention to phenomena” (404) enables “taking up the position of the device; by turning oneself into a camera, one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully” (407). Although Love is uninterested in “distant reading” as synonymous with Moretti (Love 411), this invocation of the mechanical implies, I argue, an obvious potential for computation. The actual practice of computational research requires a great deal of laborious, intimate encoding. The researcher must occupy a “mechanical” position of receiving inputs and responding to them consistently over time, whether entering details in a spreadsheet with a consistent taxonomy or running the same program over multiple datasets. Love says:
Good descriptions are in a sense rich, but not because they truck with imponderables like human experience or human nature. They are close, but they are not deep; rather than adding anything ‘extra’ to the description, they account for the real variety that is already there. (377)
A computational model is unlikely to “truck with imponderables,” but it absolutely must “account for the real variety that is already there” or else the code will simply fail to run. If you are forced to manually encode your assumptions into a system, you are forced to confront what they are. Even deleting or ignoring information is still a way of “accounting for” it in the coding process: some part of the program will have to say, in effect, ‘if I get an input that doesn’t match what I expect, discard it.’ Choosing to ignore contradictory or difficult information carries the assumption that this information does not ‘count,’ or does not matter to the question at hand. The choice faced by scholars is how to address our encoded assumptions. The encounter with variety does not in itself produce nuanced results: it is possible to selectively ignore any uncomfortable details. But it is also possible to do computation reflectively, asking not “how can I make this work the way I want?” but “where do my assumptions encounter resistance?” and turning one’s attention to the nature of the resistance. Integrating this reflection into the research process can allow a scholar to avoid both the pitfalls of “conquering” their material and of claiming an algorithmic grasp of “objective” truth. </Text>
            <Comments>Appendix B (“Methodology”) contains many examples of these algorithmic procedures executed by the human researcher and the computational programs in concert. The act of writing a program is an iterative process of delegation.</Comments>

            <Text>A potential fifth chapter could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production. (Assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) My previous work suggests that the Gothic, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. This chapter use a stylometric approach to computationally identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? (I expect it to be a lot.) What kinds of literary productions are most resistant to the Gothic?

            <Title>Early Novels Database</Title>
            <Text>So while the full.tsv contains records for works published as early as 1660 and as late as 1853, you can choose the 18c-full.tsv to look only at records published from 1700-1799, and the 19c-full.tsv for records with publication dates from 1800-1853.

About the Dataset
The Early Novels Dataset contains bibliographic metadata for early works of fiction held in the Collection of British and American Fiction, 1660-1830 (CBAF) at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, as well as other regional repositories. It consists of MARC catalog records enriched with custom subfields designed to offer new kinds of structured data about early fiction in English.

The END dataset is comprised of high-quality, human-generated metadata that captures a much fuller range of edition- and copy-specific information about early novels than traditional library catalog records. The END metadata schema builds on library-standard MARC records with custom-designed subfields that use both controlled and discursive vocabularies to describe a range of bibliographic features outside the scope of traditional cataloging. These include important bibliographic details such as authority statements, full and half title, accurate and controlled place of publication, and edition statement. They capture both copy-specific information about marginalia, inscriptions, and bookplates as well as title-level data on narrative form. And finally, they record the presence of important paratextual features like authors’ notes, epigraphs, footnotes, and indices, which can be found in many works of early fiction but have never been cataloged in a systematic way that would enable faceted search across a corpus.

As of September 2017, the complete Early Novels Dataset totals 2,041 records. The core eighteenth-century subset consists of 1,325 records, which represent all of Penn Libraries’ Collection of British and American Fiction holdings published from 1700-1794 and a sampling of holdings published from 1795-1799. A sample comparison of the CBAF holdings from the decade of the 1760s with all known fiction in English published during this period suggests that Penn's collection represents approximately 14% of this total corpus. In the core eighteenth-century subset, Penn's holdings are supplemented with selected holdings from other Philadelphia-area and regional repositories, including the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Rosenbach, the Swarthmore Libraries Rare Book Room, Bryn Mawr College Special Collections, and New York University's Fales Library.

Pair END Data with Fulltext for Topic Modeling
While END’s primary focus is metadata, we are also in the preliminary stages of a fulltext initiative for the CBAF novels digitized by Penn Libraries and available through Print at Penn. We have created fulltext files for each of these texts using OCR; cleanup work is ongoing, both computationally and through hand-correcting. The fulltext is available in our digital-collection repostiory. We have also worked with Penn Libraries' Digital Humanities Specialist Scott Enderle to experiment with topic modeling of this fulltext combined with END metadata. Work-in-progress can be found in our earlynovels-topic-model repository, and Scott's enhanced Topic Modeling Tool, which enables pairing fulltext with metadata, can be found here.</Text>

            <Text>“Theory's suspension of the category of the literary, institutionalized as the inclusion of nonliterary works in its syllabus, might seem in a narrow sense more radical than a movement to open the canon to minority works that remain, after all, literary works" (176)
“the enormous significance of the /word/ 'theory,' as the unifying name of manifestly heterogenou critical practices." (177)
“deconstruction stands in a peculiarly representative or symptomatic relation to all theory” (178)
“what problem within the discipline of literary criticism becomes manifest as the symptomatology of the deManian ouevre” (179)
theory relies on "the charismatic persona of the master theorist"; theorists are seen as masters by the fact that they have disciples (179)
“By referring all language to rhetoric the literary critic can read anything, but in practice this has meant reading non-literary texts as literary“ (180)
“rhetoricism itself, the equation of literature with rhetoric, is the ideology of theory” (180)
“Althusser suggests that a symptomatic reading of a text reveals that the text provides an answer to a question which does not itself appear in the text.” (180)
de Man does ask “what is literature?” but the real question he answers (with “rhetoricism”) is "what shall replace literary criticism as it was formerly practiced, [ie] as the appreciative interpretation of the syllabus of 'literary’ works?” (180)
de Man framed his methodology as technically rigorous. conforming to new social norms of intellectual work as technobureaucratic (181)
“I will attempt to read this problem as the failure of de Manian theory (and theory in general) to function as anything other than an interim, imaginary solution to the new conditions of intellectual labor, conditions that will certainly require a thorough rethinking of what it is that literary critics do in the classroom and in their writing. In the meanwhile we can say that the reconstruction of criticism as a ‘technical' practice revealed the intrinsic inadequacy of the literary syllabus as the object of that intellectual labor; hence the ‘rigor' of theory had to be embodied not in literary works but in the philosophical or other nonliterary texts supplementing that syllabus. It is these works, the 'canon of theory,' which signify rigor." (181)
"If the institutional locus of canon formation is the school, and its instrumentality the syllabus, the social relation between teacher and student oddly effaces its institutional conditions in producing nothing less than a kind of love: first the love of the disciple for the master, and then the love for what the master teaches, his 'teaching,' and beyond that, as we shall see, a love for the very texts the master loves." (182)
"By transferring the eros of the transference to the lesson, the transference itself will disappear; it will be terminated. ... And this is to say that nothing will remain of de Man in the lesson, that loving the lesson is not, finally, the same as loving de Man." (185)
"The possible indistinction between religion and science is the achievement of psychoanalysis to have discovered, but at the (possible) cost of its own scientificity” (190)
de Man repurposes vocabulary of psychoanalysis for a linguistic reading (191)
de Man says that teaching is not an intersubjective relation, and there IS no intersubjective relation (192)
"What de Man gains tactically by reducing all intersubjective relations to the possibility of cognitive (that is, linguistic) error is the total obliteration of the transference from the terrain of the discussion." (193)
“The concept of error, then, as a linguistic concept, takes the place of the concept of the unconscious only by transferring an unconscious agency to language itself, in its privileged linguistic forms such as literature, rhetoric, or the text." (194)
“Lacan and de Man appear to set off resolutely on opposite theoretical directions, but ... they end up in the same place, the place of the ‘the subject who is supposed to know.’” (195)
"some account of what de Man means when he says that the 'resistance to theory’ which takes the form of  simple rejection of rhetorical reading is a ‘displaced symptom' of a reistance internal to the theoretical enterprise itelf. It is a displaced symptom of something the master actually encounters in his disciples, namely, /no resistance at all/, a boundless receptivity to the transmission of his doctrine as a positive knowledge." (197)
“‘it is not certain that there can be a science of literature' (RDR, 171). It is certain, however, that there can be  a  /discipline/ of literature." (198)
“Lacan expresses the problem of psychoanalytic theory's transmission as the thematic of the distinction between science and religion. What the theorist wants (but this is not yet equivalent to the 'desire of the analyst’) is the transmission of theory, that is, the solution to a problem in pedagogy. Whether or not a theory carries with it a claim to scientificity, its transmission would be better assured by its organization in the form of a science” (198)
“In the context of the pedagogic objective, discipleship is simply intstrumental (as Lacan says) and no transference which took as its final object the person of the master theorist would be adequate to the task of transmission" (198)
“Transference transferred is the form of transference /in general/. How would this transference, formally speaking, be different from the transmission of a science? We are forced to conclude that it would not, that the desire for one's works to be received as a science is not distinguishable from the desire for discipleship, for the /form/ of a church.” (198)
distressing when disciples get it wrong, but also when they get it /exactly/ right
”the self-discipline of the disciples, the mechanism by which theory is reproduced with an exactitude which then becomes the object of the master's ambivalent fixation" (199)
“If one nevertheless finds the examples quoted above unusual in their imitative precision..." -- I do not; I don't even see a lot of connection. (200)
“in pedagogy no dissolution of the transference occurs” (200) -- I think this is Guillory's idea
the point “is not that de Manian discipleship is anomalous for permanently fixing the transference, but that pedagogy itself is a social relation constituted by a transference which tends toward permanent fixation. ... The transferrence in pedagogy is least likely to be dissolved when the thought is transmitted in the ‘impersonal' form of a science.” (201)
disciples follow de Man's technique fundamentally by imitating his style -- that's what makes it ‘teachable, generalizable, and highly responsive to systematization’ (201)
"the transference onto theory always misses its object, the positive content of theory, by cathecting in and behind that object the image of the master.” (201)
Lacan's matheme: “By reducing transmission to a rote process the doctrine was supposed to escape a certain contingency of the transference, its constitutive ambivalence, its love-hate. But the reception of the matheme marked a greater investment in the transference than ever before, even as both master and disciple deferred to the impersonal form of the algorithm.” (202)
“the teaching of both de Man and Lacan attempts to account and compensate for the vicissitudes of transmission by attributing those vicissitudes to an epistemological defect of language, or by refusing in principle the possibility of the dissolution of the transference. The two positions amount in practice to the same thing." (202)
“what unifies the syllabus which includes (among others) Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, or Nietzche, Freud, Saussure, and Heidegger, is the fact that these oeuvres can be taken to embody a discourse of mastery, which is always by definition an imitable discourse." (203)
“The names which circulate as ‘theory' in this canonical sense are actually very few in number, much more restricted a list than that which constitutes ‘canonical' literary work. Furthermore the very canonical organization of these texts, their recategorization as 'theory', has the effect of neutralizing the generic, disciplinary, and ideological differences between them in much the same way that the literary canon tends to define all canonical literary texts as the embodiment of a single quality of 'literariness’.” (203)
"The larger question, for which I shall attempt to provide a properly sociological analysis in the latter part of this chapter, is why the literary critical profession should now require a canon which signifies in its totality a discourse of mastery, in addition to the traditional 'literary' canon, whose significance, as we shall see, is considerably altered by its interrelation with the theory-canon." (203)
the works which get studied are in fact chosen because the great masters LIKE them, personally -- but we don't say that's why (204)
“a contempt for the very discipleship which is the mechanism of theory's transmission... is inevitably cultivated by the master theorists, as the inevitable accompaniment to the cultivation of disciples” (205)
de Man's "terminology produces certain discursive effects. These effects are (1) the conflation of linguistics with rhetoric; (2) the equation of literature with rhetoric; and (3) the reduction of rhetoric to trope." (208)
1. The conflation of linguistics with rhetoric (209)
de Man defines literary language: “literariness, the use of language that foregrounds the rhetorical over the grammatical and the logical function" (210)
2. The equation of literature with rhetoric (212)
rhetoric and literariness have to be historically defined, not theorized universally, though de Man says otherwise (213)
“What is at stake in the noncoincidene of literature and rhetoric is the historical relation between them.” (213)
"The identification of literature with rhetoric is conditional upon the appearance of the category of ‘literature' in the later eighteenth century as a set of genres both segregated from, and elevated above, the general field of writing.” (213)
we now do Fielding in lit and Hume in philosophy "a categorization that would have been exactly reversed earlier in the eighteenth century, when Hume had a distinguished literary career and Fielding could be dismissed as a mere writer of 'novels’.” (213) -- so, not EXACTLY reversed, bc Fielding wouldn't be in philosophy
end result of Early Modern concept of scientific truth creates the idea of "fiction”; in 18thC ”the category of the 'literary' could then be restricted to the fictional genres. The new generic system had to develop a conception of truth proper to its form and the theorization of this truth describes in the largest sense the project of 'Romantic' criticism" (214)
“To be sure, we are always prepared for another rehearsal of the quarrel between poetry and philosophy ... but it remains a historically determinate fact that, for us, the question of this relation can only be posed /after science/." (214)
“it is by means of a return to rhetoric that the generic distinction between literary and non-literary texts can be reconceptualized as a linguistic distinction, the problem of 'literary language’” (214)
de Man's theory has a gaping hole re: what it can study, but because students can just fall back on studying the fixed syllabus he has used of a relatively fixed and institutionally normal set of texts, "the discrepancy between its stability and its theoretical groundlessness need never be examined” (216)
de Man’s privileged tropes are metaphor and metonymy (221)
de Man's reading detaches the names of tropes (metaphor, metonymy) “from their conventional significations in rhetoric” (226)
de Man's reading is thematic; the use of 'tropes’  "permit the methodology to advertise itself as rigorously rhetorical or non-thematic” (227)
for de Man “metaphor and metonymy mean necessity and chance” (227)
In valuing chance over necessity/identity/totality, "What is at stake, always, is the locus of agency, or the illusion of the determination of language by an autonomous subject or person." (228)
“Shall we now say that the thematic of chance and necessity has led de Man to a version of /materialism/?” this is how his disciples have interpreted it (228)
“while the project of theory was to produce such a thematic sublation of literature, this project could be accomplished only by supplementing the literary canon with another set of texts whose function was to reflect precisely the identity of literature." (230)
section: "De Rigeur, or the Charisma of Routinization" (231)
people want "the artficialist illusion that the Work of Schooling could escape bearing the mark of the institutional conditions of its exercise. All school culture is necessarily standardized and ritualized, i.e., ‘routinized' by and for the routine of the Work of Schooling” (Bourdiew and Passeron, /Reproduction/, qtd in Guillory 231)
rhetorical reading gets its rigor from its ability to produce readings that the reader doesn't want -- but "Let us consider the possibility that nothing is more desirable than that the conclusion of the reading be known in advance" (231)
“The rigor of rhetorical reading is not by any means the rigor of an argument in which the knowledge produced at its conclusion can actually take the reader by surprise." (232)
“The rigor of rhetorical reading is thus more rigor than a science requires: it is the rigor of a prescience, a foreknowledge.” (232)
de Man "will praise the work of a disciple as ‘technical rather than aesthetically pleasing’ (CW, 121), by which he means that it achieves the condition of rigor” - relying on a contemporary ideal of 'techne' as science rather than its classical definition as art (232)
"I shall be attempting to locate the political effects of deconstruction initially in the conditions of intellectual work, the labor specific to the literary academic. It is in the latter context that the fetishization of ‘rigor' has particular force, where rigor signifies less the fatedness of human beings in general as it does the nature of the intellectual work of theory." (233)
there are places where de Man has to 'force' his reading; these coincide with “the appearance of lurid figuration, and such proximity raises questions about the rigorousness of rigor; for what if the trajectory were being determined by the effect of pathos itself-- that is, a /narrative/ effect-- and not by the argument's unassailable logic” (235)
"As rhetorical reading's most overdetermined concept, rigor facilitates an imaginary reduction of the social totality to the structure of the trope, and it thus permits rhetorical reading to function as a political theory just by virtue of being no more than a theory of literature." (236)
“If de Manian deconstruction authorizes no specific political practice, as its critics have been eager to claim, that is beside the point. We should do better to ask why a theory of literature (much less of trope) should imply a political practice." (236)
deconstruction responded to an external demand (that the syllabus serve a political purpose) "by imposing a limit to curricular revision, a limit intended to preserve theory as literary theory." (237)
“that ethos is irrelevant to the situation of American academics, for whom Marxism has not been a /political/ force in many decades.” (240). burn!
American universities are more marginalized in the culture than European ones; graduate study in America is not about real politics but the politics of the profession -- grad students will be profs, not go on to other jobs (241)
“Deconstruction is always and from the first ‘institutionalized,' as it has no other locus of practice, dissemination, or resistance than university literature departments. Nevertheless the motif of 'institutionalization' has large discursive effects because it allows deconstruction to occupy, at the moment of its origin, an imaginary locus /exterior/ to the institution." (242)
discussing politics “by addressing directly the institutional dilemma of deconstruction -- not resistance but discipleship (transference-resistance), and the routinization effects at once produced and lamented by the disciples. This is t say that what theory responds to is not immediately politics, but the conditions of institutional life, the everyday life of the professors of literature." (245)
“de Man's argument is that departments of literature have denied their institutional identity as departments; they have constructed an institutional self-image which devalues their own purely institutional functions. Against such institutionalized anti-institutionalism de Man proposes a thorough reinvestment in the form of the department, as the basic structural unit of the university.” which means no longer being 'large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter' but instead ‘much smaller units, dedicated to.. professional specialization’ (247)
“professionalism names an ideological discourse, the ego-ideal of the professoriate, and not simply an institutional practice." (247)
Weber makes charisma and bureaucracy “the historical and structural antipodes of his sociology” (248)
"According to this formulation, it should be impossible for charismatic authority to appear within bureaucratic institutions at all. Truly bureaucratic authority dissolves charisma and replaces it with a cathexis of the office rather than the person” (248)
he's setting up to produce an analysis of bureaucracy (250)
“the degree of bureaucratization, or what I will call ‘heteronomy’—the degree to which one's work is prescribed by superiors in the bureaucratic hierarchy—exists in a certain ratio to the degree of 'professional activity,' a realm of more autonomous behavior, defined for teachers both by the privacy of the classroom and by academic freedom of discourse among colleagues in a field" (251)
“acknowledging the overdetermination of the concept of 'autonomy' in the contemporary school by the complex interaction of the two relative autonomies, the pedagogic and the bureaucratic”
"the charisma of the master theorists could be translated into bureaucratic prestige" (255)
“the institutional position of the master theorist, as the person in whom institutional and personal prestige is ‘blended,’ and in whom the concept of 'autonomy' is maximally overdetermined, was always a condition for the emergence of theory.” (155)
“The increasingly technobureaucratic organization of the professional field of literary criticism was a condition for the emergence of theory, which we can understand in retrospect as the reassertion of charismatic authority in the face of that technobureaucratic domination." (256)
"Within the larger discourse of 'theory,' rhetorical reading has the important symptomatic function of figuring a  rapprochement with the institutional conditions of criticism, by acknowledging the loss of intellectual autonomy as a theory of linguistic determinism -- at the same time that autonomy is continually reinvested in the figure of the master theorist. But this is an autonomy which exists only on the imaginary /outside/ of the institution, as an 'anti-institutional' charisma.” (259)
theory introduces to grad pedagogy "a syllabus whose symptomatic function is to signify precisely methodological 'rigor,' rather than the taste or discrimination which for so long determined the ideological protocols of literary criticism.” (260)
theory has become “work on a set of problems that concern all critics” (26), working on "the problem of 'specialization,' or the effects of the technobureaucratic organization of labor on the discipline of criticism" (261)
grad seminars offer unique freedom for theory to appear, but “The indifference of university administrators to the graduate curriculum reflects less their respect for the traditional autonomy of the graduate teacher as it does an accurate estimation of the diminished significance of the literary curriculum in the context of the university’s perceived social function, the perceived demand for the knowledges it disseminates." (261)
“the hegemony of that technobureaucratic organization of intellectual life which has rendered the literary curriculum socially marginal by transforming the university into the institution designed to produce a new class of technical/managerial specialists possessed of purely technical/managerial knowledge." (261)
struggles to identify a 'rationale' for literary study that would produce a syllabus of literary works (262)
schools used to be tasked with "the impossible task of at once democratizing the distribution of knowledges and maintaining class distinctions" but now "the nation-state…no longer requires that a distinctive practice of … language identify a culturally homogenous bourgeoisie. That class has long since been replaced by a culturally heterogenous New Class” (263)
“it is the absence of such a crucial social function which the professors of literature experience as powerlessness in the face of a political entity--the state--which they misrecognize as the source of disempowerment." (263)
“It is not yet clear whether a 'cultural studies' curriculum has been conceived which does not replicate the theoretical and hermeneutic paradigms of literary interpretation.” (265)
“If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically, by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that the several recent crises of the literary canon—its 'opening’ to philosophical works, to works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need to reconceptualize the object of literary study.” (265)

Footnotes

“1n the argument to follow, I will be using the term "symptomatic" in the specific sense developed by Althusser in Reading Capital, trans. Ben Brewster (London: Verso, 1970),28. For a somewhat different use of Althusser's technique of symp- tomatic reading to interpret de Man's oeuvre, see Ellen Rooney's Seductive Reasoning: Pluralism as the Problematic of Contemporary Literary Theory (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1989). Rooney very persuasively demonstrates the fact that pluralism is a problematic which underlies much critical theory, even theories which appear to contradict each other. She finds in de Man another version of the problematic of "general persuasion" which posits "a homogeneous commu- nity of readers" (161). While I would agree that de Man shares certain pluralist assumptions with much other contemporary criticism, I have attempted to discern in this chapter a problematic which is more specific to the project of deconstructive theory in its symptomatic relation to the institutionalized theory syllabus.” (371)
“I use the terms "deconstruction" and "rhetorical reading" interchangeably, de- spite the fact that the former term is attached equally to the work of Jacques Derrida. In making this terminological choice I mean to draw explicit attention to the problematic conflation of rhetorical reading with the concept of deconstruction in general usage. While the term "deconstruction" encloses the work of de Man and Derrida within a set of generalized theoretical motifs and procedures, it does so only in the practice of literary criticism. This fact has ensured the consequence that Derridean philosophy is largely transmitted to literary critics through the lens of his reception in the immediate context of de Man's critical writing. It is through de Man's work that the term deconstruction is disseminated, as the name of a school of criticism; in the preface to Allegories of Reading, he remarks that he "first came across" the term in Derrida's writing. On the question of the differences between de Manian and Derridean deconstruction, it is customary to defer to Rodolph Gasche's scrupulous appraisal, "Deconstruction as Criticism," in Glyph 6 (Bal- timore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979). I would of course agree with Gas- / che that there are crucial differences between the respective projects of de Man and Derrida which need to be, so to speak, "reiterated." But where does that leave the term "deconstruction"? It is my supposition that there is very little "deconstruc- tive" criticism which is not capable of being regarded as a version of "rhetorical reading. " To this point we may add a reiteration of the differences, first by de Man, then by Derrida. From The Resistance to Theory: "In some cases, a direct link may exist between philosophy and literary theory. More frequently, however, contem- porary literary theory is a relatively autonomous version of questions that also sur- face, in a different context, in philosophy, though not necessarily in a clearer and more rigorous form" (RT, 8). And from the Afterword to Limited Inc: "But it may be permissible to underscore that I have never assimilated or reduced, as is often said, concept to metaphor. . . . Instead, I have sought to deconstruct the concept of metaphor itself and proposed an entirely different 'logic,' 'a new articulation' of the relations between concept and metaphor, which is to say, also, between philosophy, science, logic on the one hand, and rhetoric on the other. Deconstruction, as I have practiced it, has always been foreign to rhetoricism-which, as its name indicates, can become another form of logocentrism-and this despite or rather because of the interest I have felt obliged to direct at questions of language and at figures of rhetoric. What is all too quickly forgotten is often what is most massively evident, to wit, that deconstruction, that at least to which I refer, begins by deconstructing logocentrism, and hence also that which rhetoricism might owe to it" (Limited Inc [Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1988], 156).” (371-372)
“8Fredric Jameson seems to me entirely correct in remarking that "De Man was an eighteenth-century mechanical materialist, and much that strikes the postcon- temporary reader as peculiar and idiosyncratic about his work will be clarified by juxtaposition with the cultural politics of the great Enlightenment philosophes." Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic o f Late Capitalism (Durham: Duke Univer- sity Press, 1991), 246. I would qualify this statement only by deemphasizing the idiosyncracy of this materialism, and arguing for the symptomatic generality of the- oretical notions such as the "materiality of the letter. " (374)
“For a rather different analysis of the kind of "work" that goes on in English departments, see Evan Watkins, Work Time: English Departments and the Circulation of Cultural Value (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1989). Watkins emphasizes the function of the "evaluation" of students in his analysis rather than, as I have, the process of credentialization in linguistic or other knowledges.” (375)
“57fhe only critic I have encountered who has remarked on the "cathexis" of boredom in the practice of rhetorical reading is D. A. Miller, who detects and ex- poses such a cathexis in J. Hillis Miller's citation of precisely this passage from de Man's work. See "The Profession of English: An Exchange," J. Hillis Miller and D. A. Miller, ADE Bulletin 88 (1987),42-58.” (377)
“1t seems evident in retrospect that deconstruction's solution to the problem of autonomy has been displaced in recent years by a more openly professionalist dis- course that vehemently reasserts professional autonomy by celebrating precisely the "blending of personal and organizational prestige." Such an ideology of profes- sionalism once again represses the bureaucratic determination of professional activ- ity, though it is no less troubled by the omnipresence of such heteronomy; it wishes rather to play the game well, "pragmatically." Most importantly it no longer needs to project its solution to the problem of work autonomy onto a theory of reading. Indeed, the versions of pragmatism and relativism now circulating in the wake of theory can display a relaxed disdain for theory's "rigor," as that term signifies a kind of prior restraint upon professional activity. In that sense pragmatism is the theory of which professionalism is the practice.” (377)
“3Raymond Williams has always argued forcefully for maintaining a sense of the historical interrelation between High and Low Cultural works. See his comment in "The Future of Cultural Studies," in The Politics ofModernism: Against the New Conformists (London: Verso, 1989): "It is necessary and wholly intellectually de- fensible to analyse serials and soap operas. Yet I do wonder about the courses where at least the teachers-and I would say also the students-have not themselves en- countered the problems of the whole development of naturalist and realist drama, of social-problem drama, or of certain kinds of serial form in the nineteenth cen- tury, which are elements in the constitution of these precise contemporary forms, so that the tension between that social history of forms and these forms in a contem- porary situation, with their partly new and partly old content, partly new and partly old techniques, can be explored with weight on both sides" (159).” (378)

            <Title>Bruhm - Gothic Novel &amp; Homophobia</Title>
            <Text>“the equation that critics of the “gay and lesbian Gothic” have understood to be present in the genre since its inception in the 1760s: that is, in Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s often-quoted assertion that “[t]he Gothic novel crystallized for English audiences the terms of a dialectic between homosexuality and homophobia, in which homophobia appeared thematically in paranoid plots” (92)” (p 272)
“ Locating the rise of that paranoid plot within the narratives of three Gothic novelists who were each “in some significant sense homosexual – Beckford notoriously, Lewis probably, Walpole iffily” (92), Sedgwick’s Between Men itself crystallizes a critical tradition that stretches back at least as far as Montague Summers’s reading of Matthew Lewis in The Gothic Quest (1938) and that inflects every sustained discussion of homosexuality and the Gothic (at least the male Gothic) of the past three decades.” (272)
Thus George Haggerty: “The connections between the history of sexuality (and the growth of sexology) and the gothic are not necessarily coincidental. They haunt each other with similarities” (Queer 51). Or Paulina Palmer: “The association of the vampire with the period of twilight, since the sunset is supposed to liberate her from her coin and permit her to venture abroad to stalk her prey, is per- tinent in metaphoric terms to the closeted lesbian who, having concealed her sexual orientation during the day, emerges at night to seek romance in the half-lit world of clubs and bars” (102). Or me: “After ifteen years of teaching Gothic literature and queer theory, I have come to regard the phrase ‘Gothic sexualities’ as self-evident, even somewhat redundant”” (272)
“True Blood is recycling a centuries-old afiliation between the Gothic and the gay; it can only use parodic humor, rather than the heuristics of urgent discovery, to talk about the Gothic and homophobia.” … “overall the series built on the rhetoric of gay liberation focuses on heterosexual plots and conventionally straight love triangles in a way that deploys the language of gayness to render gayness irrelevant.” (273) 
“if homosex is not a central thematic or a representational topos for a twentyirst-century television show, it is even less a representational topos for the eighteenthand nineteenth-century Gothic novel” “A genre that is notorious for its presentation of verboten sex acts – voyeurism, rape, incest, sexual torture and bondage, adultery, cuckoldry, “illegitimate” pregnancy – the classic British Gothic, to the best of my knowledge, presents no scenes of male-male sodomy” (273) 
“This, to my mind, is a remarkable lacuna, one that cannot be explained with references to literary history or censorship practices. We had seen male-male sex acts earlier in the century, in John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (1748) and Tobias Smollett’s Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751), and eighteenth-century French pornography did not stint on the spectacle of male homosexual sex – Sade is enough to cite here (see Hanson, Tuite, and Stoddart) – but no British homophobic Gothic depicts its homophobia with the object lesson of the homosexual. No version of the disgust expressed by Fanny Hill or Peregrine Pickle over the spectacle of the sodomite inds its Gothic equivalent in a genre willing to depict for us the pulverized mass of a Mother Superior’s corpse (see Matthew Lewis’s The Monk) or the teeth marks that lacerate a dead couple’s body as, incarcerated and starved, they turn cannibal to prolong their miserable lives (see Robert Maturin’s Melmoth the Wanderer). The Gothic novel, at least prior to the Stonewall Resistance Riot of 1969, and at least in its male characters, is profoundly reticent about the spectacle of direct homophobia, as reticent as it is about the spectacle of homosexuality. How might we understand this?” (274)
“The role of metonym as the predominant trope in Gothic representations of homophobia is critically important because, if metonym constitutes the homosexual-homophobic relation in the Gothic, it displaces it at the same time.” (275)
“something might be gained in disentangling the homosexual from the paranoid, the metaphor from the metonym, the notorious from the ify, and to ask again what interventions the Gothic might make in the spectacle of normative sexual relations.” (276)
“If the classic Gothic could occlude the site of male-male sex, whose presence is detectable only through the rhetorical double-speak of metonymy, the Gothic makes women’s same-sex pleasure too legible” (277)
THE MONK
“Tuite argues that it presents, explodes, and then retroactively reconstitutes a homoerotic relationship that is “specifically pedagogical and pederastic” (278) “The heterosexual excess that ensues is, for Tuite, made possible by the homoerotic energies established before the unveiling, and retroactively makes of that male bond a sexualized, if unacted on, energy” (278)
“Tuite’s argument that heterosexuality relegates the homosexual to the closet – thus to fears of blackmailability – actually displaces the fear from the site at which it exists: in heterosexual relations. “Ambrosio is in danger – of discovery, of disgrace, of immortal perdition – only by virtue of Matilda’s presence as a woman in the monastery.” (278)
“Miles convincingly notes how biographical concerns have shaped criticism of The Monk so that the “open secret” of Lewis’s homosexuality compels us to read the novel within the personal and political landscape of sodomy in 1790s Britain.” (279)
“In this reading, Gothic novels are less novels than they are creative autobiographies – and we might pause to wonder whether a subject wishing to confess to a desire that might see him hanged on the morrow would turn to the mode of the Gothic” (280)

CARMILLA
“For every part vampire, Carmilla is also part damsel in distress, and for every part distressed damsel, Carmilla is also, for feminist and antihomophobic readers, an agent of sexual liberation.” (281)
“In my reading of The Monk and its critics, lines of desirous light coalesce into a centralizing identity of a Homosexual Author writing his experiences as code within and against a homophobic culture. Antihomophobic critics have read these lines of light as metonyms-begetting-metaphors, and thus of identity writ large. Something similar happens in “Carmilla,” only in reverse.” (282)
“Like Veeder, who argues that the text’s lesbianism is a mere occasion for Victorianism’s larger concerns regarding repression tout court (198), for Stoddart the lesbian makes most sense when she is about something else, about historical, colonial, masculinist pursuits. In these readings, lesbian pleasure in ‘Carmilla’ exists to take us away from lesbian pleasure in ‘Carmilla’” (282)
“Of course, both critics know that the vampire does reproduce – she makes other vampires – but in Stoddart’s estimation, there is nothing life-giving or airmative about such birthing: the story’s lesbianism is “female sexuality, not turned toward itself but turning on itself, and the result is not desire for love but cruelty, possession, contagion, and, potentially, death” (32).6” (283)
“Before we see such textual and social homophobia as an attack on our dignity, we might also wonder whether to prefer “sterility” if sterility’s opposite – compulsory reproduction – might itself be something that queers want to resist.” (283) — Turn to Lee Edelman
“Queer not just for their crossdressing or their lesbian desire, Matilda and Carmilla infect and destroy with the teasing allure of sexuality lived otherwise.” (285)

Conclusion: “It has been my contention in this chapter that the search and rescue mission of detecting gays and lesbians as victims of homophobia in the Gothic has left us trapped in a hermeneutic circle that can only assuredly provide us with what we have been looking for: evidence of phobic persecution. I am suggesting instead that the Gothic propensity to shatter bodies and souls be read alongside the queer propensity to shatter egos and identities that have been sexualized as gay or straight by a culture that fetishizes such identity. In this reading, the “homo” under duress may be less the persecuted or abjected sexual pervert than it is the determined, the stable, the legible self of Western modernity.” (285)

Footnote: “Here I part from Miles, who reads heterosexual incest in Lewis as “a cipher for a yet more heinous – within the codes of polite writing, a literally unspeakable – desire” (52), the desire for same-sex pleasure. The eighteenth-century novel has spoken this desire at length, and the Gothic novel hardly qualiies as “polite writing.”” (285)

“Visualizing the Print Mediascape of the 1790s.” North American Society for the Study of Romanticism. Toronto, ON, August 6-8, 2020.

The 1790s saw unprecedented quantities of print production, spurring debates about how best to identify which works of writing were worthy of further attention. Competing value systems offered different ways to understand what made a work “important” or “popular,” with particular conflict around what made a work “literature.” My research examines the mirror-image of this question, asking what kind of publications were normal. After a series of computational experiments in drawing inferences from bibliographic metadata, I present several ways of visualizing the print output of the 1790s, particularly in terms of gender and genre. 
My research examines the authorship and subject matter (broadly construed) of all titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799 which are included in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) database, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) database, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus, or the HathiTrust database. I calculate the proportion of the titles in each resource that are attributed to men, to women, or are left unsigned. Using the titles of these works and a topic modelling tool which has performed accurately when compared to a manual assessment of random samples, I also roughly identify the subject matter of each title, categorizing works into broad genres such as drama, poetry, Romance, History, or sermons. I am then able to compare these four resources to each other, and to existing scholarly work on the print production of the 1790s. For example, I am able to compare each resource’s holdings to the statistics on the English novel included in Garside, Raven and Schöwerling’s Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction. The core of this paper is a series of data visualizations presenting my experimental results, and drawing on Johanna Drucker’s work on the 
These comparisons illuminate the implicit principles of selection which have shaped the ECCO-TCP and HathiTrust digital collections, but also suggest conclusions about the period itself. I present multiple ways of visualizing the same underlying “data,” (that is, the print production of the 1790s itself) in order to analyze the implications of each way of seeing the decade’s literature. From what viewpoint, for example, can we see the hordes of female Radcliffean imitators which were so decried for dominating the print marketplace? And what other visions are possible?





In the 1790s, in response to unprecedented volumes of print production, British audiences disagreed about how to identify which works of writing were worthy of further attention. Despite sometimes grandiose claims that computational distant reading would make it possible to examine all of literature, without needing to make selections, it is still a matter of important debate to discuss what qualifies a work as “important,” “literary,” or “popular.” In this paper, I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to discuss what constitutes normal within this eleven-year “decade,” and therefore which works and authors might emerge as exceptional.  Particular attention is paid to what contexts reveal, or conceal, the importance of writers as diverse as William Wordsworth, Ann Radcliffe, and Hannah More.</Text>

            <Text>“The preceding chapter argues that there can be no /general/ theory of canon formation that would predict or account for the canonization of any particular work, without specifying first the unique historical conditions of that work's production and reception. Neither the social identity of the author for the work's proclaimed or tacit ideological messages definitively explain canonical status. If this were not true, ideologically heterodox works would never achieve canonicity, nor would writing produced by any member of a socially defined minority.” (85) It's the “task of the school, not of works themselves" to assimilate a range of works. (85)

“raises an interesting question about the actual relation between the ideological contents of particular literary works and the immediate historical circumstances of their canonization.” (85)

this chapter will look at Gray's elegy to examine "the moment at which the vernacular English canon enters the school system as a literary curriculum in competition with the classical curriculum" -- and as a work which raises the question of canons &amp; how to value noncaonical works (via the unidscovered "gem”) (86)
Gray's elegy had substantial "linguistic capital” -- "rapidly established itself in the school system as a perfect poem for introducing schoolchildren to the study of English literature” (86)
“impression of an immediate but sophisticated accessibility” -- a sense that it is all made up of familiar poetic phrases — due to the 'commonplace book’  (87)

“the commonplace book had to be discarded as a matrix of composition in order for the Romantic locodescriptive lyric to set itself against the rhetorical commonplace" (88)
the poem's sentiments are not original but commonplace; it's the poem's "tone" which makes them effective and powerful (91)
"The affect of complacence is produced... by the relation of the commonplace... to the ‘universality and impersonality’ of the style. I would like to propose that this style is produced by the /systematic linguistic normalization of quotation/“ (92)
"The cento of quotable quotations which /is/ the poem thus generates a reception-scenario characterized by the reader's pleased recognition that 'this is my truth,' while at the same time concealing the fact that this pleasure is founded on the subliminal recognition that 'this is my language.’” (92)
the lack of class mobility is “stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it. ... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that the man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities. ... Many people, without being communists, have been irritated by the complacence in the massive calm of the poem, and this seems partly because they feel there is a cheat in the implied politics” (Empson 4-5, qtd in Guillory 94)
"The fact of increased upward mobility is at once the premise of ‘bourgeois ideology' -- that anyone can succeed -- and its prime source of social anxiety. … there must be neither too little nor too much social mobility.” (95)
the school "as the site at which social mobility is choked off" (95) -- the poor should be actively deprived of education in order to minimize too much mobility
“since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless’ knowledge comes to stand… as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent." (96-97)
"This ambivalence... is ultimately resolved with the entry of vernacular literature into the new, middle-class schools. The study of vernacular literature is thus at first a substitute for the study of Greek and Latin, but with the same object of producing a linguistic sign of social distinction” (97)
“the impetus behind the / standardization of speech does not come from the landed nobility but from a much wider and more heterogeneous group, which is beginning to recognize itself not as other than aristocratic but as part of a society of ‘gentlemen,’ defined according to norms of behavior and education rather than blood” (98)
"the bourgeoisie comes to know itself ... as the speakers of a national language. Until that imagined community comes to be, the 'polite language' of earlier eighteenth-century literary culture continues to embody a confusion of aristocratic and bourgeois cultural norms, and an ambivalence in the relation of vernacular to classical literacy. (99)
The trajectory sketched here is intended to make sense of one moment in that history of literary canon formation to which Gray's /Elegy/ belongs” (99)
"This moment is virtually the last moment at which literary culture can sustain a discourse of polite letters in the vernacular without establishing this discourse in the schools. And it is virtually the last moment at which polite speech can easily be assimilated to the concept of the gentleman as aristocrat, and therefore to a class structure simply divided into aristocracy and commons.” (99)
“the event (in the 1740s and 1750s) which transforms English literary culture: the passage of English vernacular texts into the schools" (99) -- at the time the poems was written (written 1750, pub 1751)
“Just as the late medieval nobility acquired literacy but did not care to master the scholastic canon of the clergy, the middling sort wished to acquire polite speech but not necessarily a knowledge of Latin or Greek." (100)
"The anxiety expressed by Sheridan is that, in the absence of an institutional form of dissemination, literary culture cannot be entrusted to preserve English works of the past; vernacular works must be revalued as equal in value to classical works and therefore worthy to be taught in the schools. This is the crucial point: the judgment of vernacular works throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries already elevates some works over others, but only the institutionalization of these works as a curriculum can revalue their cultural capital as the equal of the classics.” (101)
DISAGREEMENT: “The absurdity of such a hypothetical departure from the meditative narrative [i.e., the impossibility of imagining the solitary teaching peasants to read] measures the peculiar force of a complex effect by which it is possible for reader to identify with / either the state of privilege or the state of deprivation, to indulge in the pathos of sympathy or the ethos of resentment.” (102-3) -- but I think the reader can always do that anyway
“Gray's poem... is followed by a poem enitled ‘Warrington Academy,' by one 'Mrs. Barbauld,' a writer no one would regard today as canonical. The adjacency of so titled a poem to Gray's call attention either to itself or to Gray, or to both." (103) No -- I don't think it CALLS attention to anything, though it might REWARD attention. Also weird that he dismisses Barbauld as if I've never heard of her, even though I totally have; she's still in the anthologies. I guess the feminists put her back in the 90s?
"Barbauld was very much in the vanguard, then, of that anthologizing movement by which English literature was given a canonical form. In this context the pendant position of ‘Warrington Academy' in relation to Gray's poem is, as we may now demonstrate, not at all accidental: Barbauld's poem reads Gray's /Elegy/ and so enacts its reception.” (104) DISAGREE - could be completely accidental, or placed because it, too, describes a place.

“Behind the generic veil certain social facts come sharply into focus: the struggle of individuals and social groups to rise. Gray's peasants of course do not struggle. Barbauld's word for the social fact she firmly grasps is "emulation,” which here has all of the senses to which I have assigned it, preeminently ‘to compete by imitiation.’" (104)
“The important point here is that the opening lines express the fact of struggle through a rhetoric of literary culture; that culture is where the struggle takes place.” (104)
“Gray's landscape contains no historical social institutions, no historical aristocrats or peasants, and that is just the point of it. It is a landscape of abstract repression: ‘Penury' represses 'rage’.” -- this contrasts with Barbauld critiquing laws that blocked Dissenters from schools. (106)
“Barbauld reads into Gray's poem, then, the immediate circumstances of her own literary production, the very conditions that bring Warrington Academy into existence. Her reading discovers at the same time what is really there in the Elegy -- an absence of reference, a structure of abstract repression, which Empson makes concrete once again by specifying that absence as the absence of a 'scholarship system,' the /carrie(accent \)re ouverte aux talents./” (107)
Gray seems to resolve his irony by turning to death -- compared to death, “the social repression that produces material inequality dwindles to insignificance” (107) -- but Guillory isn't fully convinced: “critics have often been able to assert that the poem is about death only by asserting it is not about something else" (107)
"The invocation of death is the rhetorical mechanism by which the social structure of repression is /abstracted/, rendered subjectless and objectless … allowing us to forget that their actual lives are foreshortened by poverty and not by death" (108) -- hm, but do we have to?
Gray only observes foreshortened potential in dead peasants, not living ones nearby (108)
he gets psychoanalytic about the flower's ‘blush' --  “The attempt to keep down or repress a sexual passion takes over from 'Chill Penury' the job of repression, and so converts a social into a psychic repression." (109)
"The great ones… can sin without blushing. The poor may desire what the wealthy and ambitious desire, but they blush with shame… and as a consequence they can be approved for pursuing 'the noiseless tenour of their way’” (110)
"a curious equation between social and /literary/ ambition. It is in this sense that the poem meditates on the process of what we call canon formation" (110) and deems "the very conditions enabling literary production" to actually be “morally inferior to the conditions which /constrain/ production” (111).
“All evocations of violence in the poem are tendentially assimilated to the motive of ambition" (111)
“we need to ask what Gray means when he substitutes Hampden, Milton, and Cromwell for Cato, Tully, and Caesar in the published version of lines 57-60. For that 'translation' into the vernacular finally locates 'Ambition' in /literary culture/, where the shrine of ‘Luxury and Pride’ is heaped with 'incense kindled at the Muse’s flame.’" (111) -- connecting Milton with Hampden and Cromwell ties literary production to an ambitious ethos
“The hypothetical achievements of the peasantry can be represented in the poem as at once tragically repressed; but on the other hand, no achievements are named in the poem which are not deplored as instances of Ambition, Luxury, and pride: hence Milton is flanked by Hampden and Cromwell.” (112)
“the proposition that the noble makes a better peasant than a peasant. ... The poem does not really address the peasantry. While the noble habitus can be represented by the imperturbably and natural nobility of literary peasants, these peasants cannot at the same time be represented as miserably impoverished. The peasants, in other words, cannot be both literary and real peasants.” (113)
I'm confused -- there's no difference between the manuscript and the published version but he quotes as if there was. (113)
"The poem discovers this melancholy subject as the solution to its intractable problems, and hence the specular eye of the first stanza is refashioned in the final version into the pastoral poet who so oddly languishes in the countryside" (114)
“what characterizes the melancholy poet of the later stanzas is not simply acquiescence in, or resentment against, the frustration of ambition, but the contradiction between emulation (or ambition) and its systematic self-repression." (114)
“the construction of the melancholy poet as both subject and object of writing reorients the process of repression to bring to the fore the relation between literary fame and obscurity, while allowing the relation of wealth and poverty to recede into the background. The imagined death of the poet functions obviously enough as the repressive agency producing resignation to obscurity as a metonymic corrollary of resignation to death” (115)
“Gray does not, as does Milton, express directly a fear of death. On the contrary, death is the signifier of an attractive self-repression (self-burial), an almost successful repression of a subject who yet leaves behind the trace of his repression in the form of a somewhat lengthy epitaph." (116)
"The figure of the solitary expresses ambivalence about the emergence of the public sphere, but that expression itself belongs to the public sphere by virtue of being literary, by virtue of being /published/" (117)
“such a strategy scarcely makes sense for either the aristocratic or the peasant writer” (117) -- which strategy? "fetishizing the ignorance of the peasant as a king of covert nobility” (117) ?
“The emergence of a 'common reader,' a literary ‘public,' was by no means universally welcome; it could be actively resisted as a process of cultural /degeneration/." (118)
“the redistribution of cultural capital is in a very real sense a revolutionary process. If the cultural capital represented by vernacular literacy signifies to some social groups the possibility of upward mobility, it can also signify the devaluation of the cultural capital possessed by other individuals or groups.” (118)
“In Gray's famous ambivalence about publication, one sees how it is possible for polite letters to react /against itself/. ... The cultural capital which in its 'public' place becomes the means of upward mobility thus reappears within Gray's literary landscape as the occasion for a kind of vertiginous homelessness, for the dislocation of the melancholy poet who imaginarily identifies with the displaced aristocrat of Renaissance pastoral." (118)
“imitative social behaviors expressed most conspicuously, of course, by Gray's disdain for publication, as though he still belonged to a manuscript culture of courtly poets, but also by his disinclination to accept money for his poems, even though Dodsley, his publisher, made large sums printing them." (119)
"The moment we are examining under high magnification here can be described in the terms formulated by Raymond Williams as a complex overlapping of 'residual' and 'emergent’ cultural formations." (119)
Elegy was popular, which Gray disliked, in part because it was unusually comprehensible compared to his other poems (120)
“The Elegy is thus at once peculiarly accessible to a wide reading public at the same time that its narrative reinscribes this access as innate rather than acquired. ... The cultural entitlement that for Gray is defined by classical literacy, by his immense learning, is thus acquired by his readers at a /discount/, at the cost only of acquiring the vernacular literacy requisite to reading the poem." (121)
elision of poetry and prose puts entire English canon in question, since "in the two previous centuries, all literature was poetry and only poetry was literature" (121)
18thC prose, unlike Renaissance prose, eschewed "neologism, archaism, complex figuration, and foreign borrowing,” defined itself as being "a normalized language” (121) -- raising the stakes of prose and poetry merging
"It is the emergence of vernacular literacy which brings the category of 'literature' to the forefront of the public sphere, and names the 'man of letters' as its producer." (123)
“canonical /forms/, the categories of textual appropriation and reproduction in their institutional sites, operate as mechanisms of selection before individuals exercise judgments, of whatever kind." (123) *** VERY IMPORTANT -- explains, e.g., novels as noncanonical bc female, as well as lower survival rates of smaller books in ESTC
“The problem of poetic diction is, after all, the problem of the cultural /distinction/ of poetry, and in that sense the argument for poetic diction argues for the greater cultural capital of poetic forms within the forms of writing. If the very capaciousness of eighteenth-century 'literature’ implicitly privileged the language of prose, Gray responded to that development by reworking the vernacular precisely in order to /estrange it from itself/, to invent a kind of vernacular Latin. But this is also a question of whether and how literature comes to estranged from the vernacular reading public, whose passion for novels calls into question the traditional hierarchy of literary forms and genres. This is a question which I should like to approach now by considering Wordsworth's critique of Gray's poetic diction, and Coleridge's response to that critique." (124)
"the return of the pastoral in the later eighteenth century makes it possible to reground normative linguistic practice in what is thought to be the /actual/ language of the peasantry.” (126)
“The literalization of pastoral speech is thus an unacknowledged idealization of the bourgeois sociolect; only in this context does Wordsworth's turn to such a simplified speech in the Preface to Lyrical Ballads appear to be something other than a mysterious and total rupsture with eighteenth-century practice.” (126)
“despite the claims of his theory, Wordsworth's poetic practice was scarcely anomalous in its literary milieu. Wordsworth himself, in the Advertisement to the 1798 Lyrical Ballads, invokes the models of Burns and Cowper.” (126)
Wordsworth, like Gray, presents “the socially distinct character of the poet threatened with effacement of obscurity in the very identification of his language with the language of the rustics” -- fear of failure of social distinction (128)
“while the mythology of the poetic character has an obvious social force, it is only the force lent it by the preexistent social distinction between aristocrat and commoner.” (129)
the fact that we need a new explanation for what distinguishes poetry from prose shows that "the generic difference between poetry and prose have already been seriously eroded" (129)
“Wordsworth's earlier poetry is in retrospect generically homogenous with the poems of Cowper or Campbell, and the real generic break occurs with the Gothicized poetic narratives of Scott and Byron.” (129)
"For the first time poetic genres and prose genres are comparable as /literary/ genres; this point is immediately evident when we consider how difficult it is in the eighteenth century to conceptualize prose genres at all." (129)
“genres had always historically been categories of poetics: the earliest classical genres were simply distinctions between kinds of meter" (130)
"Wordsworth's embrace of prose as the language really spoken by men represents a compromise between his distaste of a clichéd poetic diction and his disdain for the taste of the public that neglects canonical works in favor of ephemeral novels, plays, and novel-like narrative poems” (130)
the distinction between 'serious' prose and 'popular' prose is a new form of the high/low culture schism, because unlike poems vs ballads, the forms of prose are the same form (131)
what now distinguishes "serious" literature from “popular" literature is its penetration into the school system: reserving a work until higher in the school hierarchy is what grants it higher status (133)

“In retrospect we can say that the virtual indifference of poetic and prose diction in the earlier eighteenth century… represents a historically unique moment. Purity of diction requires the participation of nearly all writing genres in the forging of a standard vernacular, in other words, a linguistically homogenous bourgeois public sphere. When the successful dissemination of the standard permits production in genres which have no canonical authorization, but which are nevertheless unimpeachable vehicles of polite speech, a canonical crisis arises in the form of an anxious discrimination of ‘serious’ from ‘popular’ writing. Wordsworth can conjure an apocalyptic scenario in which the works / of Milton and Shakespeare are swallowed up in the sea of popular writing only because the distinction between serious and popular genres produces no corresponding linguistic differentiation within the reading public. The language of Radcliffe and Scott is as pure and correct as the language of the poets, but this condition does not obtain indefinitely. The division of literary production into ‘literature’ and the genres which are by definition subliterary or nonliterary does eventually produce a corresponding linguistic distinction when genres are distributed by the curricula of the educational system in order to separate them out according to the levels of the system. Already in the nineteenth century certain ‘popular’ works are relegated to the lower levels of the system, other ‘serious’ works to the higher, and this sorting out across the vertical structure of the educational system, initially very modest, is gradually more marked over the succeeding century and a half. As the school becomes the exclusive agent for the dissemination of High Canonical works, replacing the quasi-educational institutions, the coffeehouses, literary clubs, and salons of eighteenth-century literacy—the realm of the bourgeois public sphere—the prestige of literary works as cultural capital is assessed according to the limit of their dissemination, their relative exclusivity. When a finite set of genres becomes the supergenre of ‘literature,’ all canonical works can be regarded as exemplifying a language essentially different from the language spoken by ‘real men,’ namely, ‘literary language.’ But from the vantage of the longue dureé, ‘literary language’ is nothing other than the successor to poetic diction, the reduction of all literature to a written language which produces a difference in speech, a social distinction, among those who have access to this second language through the schools. The theory of ‘literary language’ is indeed our poetics, even when that language appears in prose, as the ‘literariness’ of literary prose. The fact that it is still possible to speak of the intrinsic difference between literary language and ordinary language is a measure of how successfully the conservators of literature have erased its origins even in the act of writing its history.” (Guillory 132-133)


“”because of their dependence on the sort of techniques of organizing and composing landscape that I have been discussing, the cultivated classes in England felt much more at ease, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in landscape which had been enclosed" (32). And: "The effect, far from suggesting any sense of locality, instead serves to show that one locality . . . can be treated in much the same way as another, in that it can be persuaded to illustrate the same rhetorical commonplaces. " I propose that the effect of generality in locodescriptive poetry is precisely the reinhabiting of the emptied "common" by the rhetorical commonplace.” (363)

”Roy Porter, English Society in the Eighteenth Century (Harmondsworth: Pen- guin Books, 1982), 65, cites a typical statement of Defoe's: "Men are every day starting up from obscurity to wealth." The question of social mobility is no longer a simple one, if it ever was, and I must therefore add the following qualifications. Historians are now inclined to emphasize a disparity between the perception of up- ward mobility and the actual rate at which this mobility occurred. Doubtless if one confines the definition of mobility to actual examples of the bourgeoisie passing into the ranks of the nobility, the numbers of those passing, as Lawrence Stone has demonstrated in The Open Elite? England 1540-1880 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), are relatively small. Stone biases his study by constricting his definition of the ruling elite to the landed country "squirearchy," and he is thus able to conclude that the "perennial openness of England's landed elite to penetration by members of newly enriched bourgeoisie is clearly no more than a hoary myth." Now this statistical revisionism is based upon what can only be an arbitrary judgment about precisely what minimum number of aristocratized bourgeois would qualify the elite as "open." Setting aside the question of whether this use of statistics is not intended to confound the very possibility of a class analysis, one may at least argue that the perception of upward mobility, which was ubiquitous and even hysterical in the eighteenth century, is a real event with real historical consequences. For a somewhat different analysis than Stone's, see Peter Laslett's The World We Have / Lost (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1965). The perception of upward mo- bility is related to the demonstrable imitation of aristocratic manners by the profes- sional middle classes and the haute bourgeoisie. The concept of upward mobility therefore cannot be confined to the actual expansion of the landed elite: its site is rather the cultural homogenization of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, which Auerbach describes in the literary/linguistic sphere. Here the evidence Stone him- self collects suggests the cardinal importance of education in this process of homog- enization (27,408), particularly the significance of the professional middle classes, the "middling sort," who were more easily capable of acquiring the knowledge and manners of the aristocracy than of acquiring vast landed capital. It is this version of social mobility which is crucial to the present argument.” (363-364)

“Herbert McLachlan, English Education Under the Test Acts (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1931),216. In a recent study, The Pristine Culture of Capitalism: A Historical Essay on Old Regimes and Modern States (London: Verso, 1991), p. 82, Ellen Meiksins Wood remarks how narrow this linguistic prac- tice could be: "Britain is certainly not alone among European nations to identify social classes by means of differential sound patterns in their habits of speech. But it is perhaps distinctive in the extent to which sound patterns, the conventions of pro- nunciation, predominate over other linguistic criteria of social difference.”” (365)

“The significance of middle-class women in this movement has been recently stressed by Nancy Armstrong, "Literature as Women's History," Genre 19 (Winter 1986),367: "Today few of us realize that many features of our standard humanities curriculum came from a curriculum designed specifically for educating polite young women who were not of the ruling class, or that the teaching of native British literature developed as a means of socializing children, the poor, and foreigners be- fore we became a masculine profession." Barbauld was uniquely privileged in he / educational opportunities (she even persuaded her father, Dr. Aiken, to teach her Latin and Greek), although she was not an advocate of schools for women. She seems to have promoted instead the more unofficial instruments of literary culture as a means of disseminating knowledge to women.” (365-366)

“For a brief account of Old Corruption, see Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer, The Great Arch: English State Formation as Cultural Revolution (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987). We might contextualize Gray's ignoble/noble strife here by point- ing also to the libelles of the French underground press, which actively dele- gitimized the French nobility in the decades before the revolution. Robert Darnton writes in The Literary Underground ofthe Old Regime (Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1982),29: "The grand monde was the real target of the libelles. They slandered the court, the church, the aristocracy, the academies, the salons, every- thing elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself, with a scurrility that is difficult to imagine today, although it has a long career in underground litera- ture." Similarly, the ethico-satiric productions of English High Culture sublimate Grub Street productions by the same techniques of "normalization" to which Gray's classical sources are subjected. Darnton's study is quite pertinent to the general argument of this essay, though it would lead us to an account of how differently the nationalizing of French literature proceeds. Darnton notes in passing that the Academie Franc;aise restricted literary immortality to "forty privileged individuals" (21). For a recent consideration of "Grub Street," as this notion is mystified by the distinction between High and Low Culture, see Kathy Macdermott, "Literature and the Grub Street Myth," in Popular Fictions: Essays in Literature and His- tory, ed. Peter Humm et al. (London: Methuen, 1986), 16-28.” (366)

"John Aiken, "Essay on Ballads and Pastoral Songs" (1793), quoted in A Book of English Verse, ed. John Barrell and John Bull (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975),435. One might remark here on a certain tension between the nationalist agenda carried by the forging of a vernacular standard and the invention of "traditions, " the latter manifested by the movement to collect specimens of the earliest English poetry (Percy's Reliques, for example). This tension might be described as the difference between the cultural value of the bourgeois sociolect and the ideo- logical value of "authentic" English dialect; perhaps the hypothetical grounding of the bourgeois sociolect in peasant speech was one way of resolving this tension.” (368)

“Since the High Culture canon is for us a given of higher education, its relation to "juvenile" literature-which no less than "great" works has a history of canon formation in the schools-has been unfortunately obscured. I would like to open up the question of this other canon, if it cannot be thoroughly explored here, by invoking some of the names in its pantheon (randomly selected): O. Henry, Ambrose Bierce, Washington Irving, Richard Connell (author of "The Most Dan- gerous Game"), Edgar Allan Poe, James Thurber, Robert Louis Stevenson, John Masefield, Carl Sandburg, Edwin Arlington Robinson, A. E. Housman, Amy Lowell, Robert Frost. The fact that some of these names appear in the High Culture canon is an interesting, not an invalidating, complication of the present thesis. Gray's "Elegy" is itself an example of this dual citizenship, since it has so frequently been taught at the primary and secondary levels.” (368)</Text>

            <Text>Smith’s posthumous critical reception has undergone multiple shifts in appreciation and obscurity. Duckling’s study of her presence in anthologies indicates that shortly after her death in 1806, Smith was widely eulogized and anthologized, remembered and emulated as an important British poet. As the nineteenth century went on, poetesses began to be anthologized separately from poets, in collections with ambitions that were commercial rather than intellectual; Smith, too, “lost intellectual ground” even as she continued to be sold (Duckling 2016). By the end of the nineteenth century, even these volumes marginalized Smith’s poetry, with prefatory material which dismissed them as trite and depressing, unenjoyable reading. In the early twentieth century, Smith began to be considered as a novelist, rather than a poet; this new field did not lead at first to a much better reputation for her. Florence Hilbish produced the first extensive study of Smith, considering her as both poet and novelist, in 1941, to unappreciative reviews: Ernest Bernbaum’s faint praise said that “‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable,” since “the subtle or intricate is absent from Charlotte Smith's writings” (138). Hilbish presents Smith’s emotional poetry as sincere rather than conventional, and her prose as more motivated by politics than commerce.
Duckling credits the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s with the beginning of Smith’s recovery (217): the renewed interest in women’s writing rediscovered her novels, and especially the radical political content which Hilbish had observed. At the same time, Bishop Hunt published a record of Smith’s influence on Wordsworth, as demonstrated by an almost overwhelming amount of physical evidence: Wordsworth owned copies of her works, which he annotated; he copied out some of her sonnets in his own hand; he paid her a personal visit; he edited some of her poetry for publication; he wrote explicitly of her influence in notes to his works. Hunt calls Smith “an important early influence on Wordsworth which has not been explored in any detail up to now” (85); his abstract somewhat snarkily asserts that “Wordsworth did not suddenly start writing sonnets in 1802 simply because he happened to read Milton’s.” However, Hunt has little praise for Smith herself: of one poem, he says, “Whatever the artistic value of such verses,” what matters is the underlying theme which Wordsworth would later express more masterfully (89). Smith continued to be treated separately as an interesting woman novelist, and a minor pre-Romantic poet, through the 1980s. Smith rose to greater prominence in both of these fields in the 1990s: with work by Stephen Curran, Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, Andrew Ashfield, and Jacqueline Labbe, “Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism” (Duckling 217).
Throughout this history, two aspects of Smith which have prompted frequent re-assessments are her personal life, and her work across genres. The first matter, the importance of a female author’s life as a woman to her importance as a figure worth remembering, is implicit in several phases of the rise and fall described above. Fry is not alone in concluding that “[f]ew writers have presented themselves in their works so fully as did Charlotte Smith” (3): Smith’s poetry lyricizes her personal experiences, her novels feature autobiographical stand-in characters, and “the often intensely personal pleading prefaces” (Behrendt 189) to her works explicitly ask for them to be read light of her ongoing struggles. Perhaps as a result, much scholarship on Smith takes the stance of The Literary Encyclopedia in defining her as a woman who wrote because of, and chiefly about, her personal distress. Antje Blank’s article there highlights Smith’s financial motive to write: “Smith turned to writing when a failing marriage and a costly lawsuit left her without resources to raise her large family” (Blank). “And so,” Blank says, Smith “churned out” her novels (and the many editions of Elegiac Sonnets, and her other poetry, and her educational writing) to support herself and her nine children (Blank). Even when Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets “won her the reputation as an author of serious verse,” this is important primarily because it “lent greater respectability to her ensuing productions in a less prestigious but more lucrative genre – the novel” (Blank). At the same time, as Labbe argues in her article “Selling One's Sorrows: Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and the Marketing of Poetry,” Smith cultivated a public persona as a paragon of victimhood and motherhood, suffering deeply but turning her suffering into marketable prose out of a duty to her children. In periods where this image of womanhood is valuable, Smith is more easily valued, as in the eighteenth and nineteenth century anthologies which saw Smith as a moral exemplar (Duckling 203-4). Or, in periods when women’s resistance to patriarchal oppression is of scholarly interest, the direct, personal nature of Smith’s writing is valuable in itself, as in early feminist scholarship.
A complicating factor to these evaluations of Smith is that, as Labbe’s edited volume Charlotte Smith in British Romanticism thoroughly demonstrates, Smith’s writing is neither as uniform nor as simplistically personal as autobiographical readings sometimes see it. Labbe contends that Smith-the-novelist and Smith-the-poet have been largely studied as separate entities, “and consequently we have been learning about two separate Smiths, each closely linked to the genre she writes in, neither closely linked to the other” (5). Labbe is not quite the first to attempt to unify Smith: Carol L. Fry’s 1996 monograph Charlotte Smith also addresses her poetry before moving on to the several phases of her novel-writing, including the children’s writing which made up much of Smith’s later career but does not appear in Labbe. Indeed, from the beginning, Hilbish’s 1941 monograph explicitly identifies Smith as “Poet and Novelist” in its title. However, Labbe is accurate regarding the somewhat different assessments of Smith current in the somewhat separate study of novels and of poetry in general: Labbe argues that as a novelist, Smith is now often praised for her innovative narrative techniques (implying a mode of writing that is intellectual and ‘distant’), whereas as a poet, she is praised for her innovative expressions of interiority (implying a mode of writing that is emotional and ‘close’). Labbe draws greater attention to important differences between Smith’s writing personae in different genres, and her edited collection “pulls together many Smiths” (2) to address these disjunctions. The volume not only addresses her novels and poetry, but also includes her plays, letters, and posthumous reception. Each of these Smiths, the volume contends, has something innovative and unexpected to reveal, important to the formation of British Romanticism. In Judith Phillips Stanton’s “Recovering Charlotte Smith's Letters,” for example, Smith’s letters, less studied, reveal a third kind of writer, different from both the novelist and the poet, who conceives of herself as a professional businesswoman of her craft. More Smiths are available in genres not included in this volume, such as Smith the naturalist and children’s author (touched on only lightly in Labbe’s volume), or Smith the political philosopher who drives Amy Garnai’s Revolutionary Imaginings in the 1790s, a highly political Smith who consciously participates in the “political public sphere” conceived by Habermas, despite Habermas’ insistence that women were excluded from this sphere (1). From these distinctions, Labbe concludes that “Smith, significantly, composes herself anew according to genre” (2) — and then asks, “Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres?” (5). This question about genre is one of the initial questions to inspire this dissertation: to see it asked as a core question about Smith demonstrates Smith’s suitability as a figure whose career can shed light on important questions about the mediascape of the 1790s.</Text>
            <Comments>[Something about each Smith having her own peers…? Political Smith now becomes peers with Mary Robinson and Elizabeth Inchbald, whereas Poetic Smith is peers with Wordsworth &amp; Coleridge, and Novelistic Smith with Radcliffe etc]
Labbe’s immediate answer: “Genre, it seems, carries a greater force in constructing our preconceptions of identity than has been recognized, and Smith is a case in point, a case we can crack by studying closely Smith’s style and techniques across genres.” (Labbe 5)</Comments>

            <Text>What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:
#
By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!
This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.
Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:
	•	A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
	•	The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &amp;c. In three volumes
	•	A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P
There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

            <Text>According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this inflammatory claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny. In fact, by the metric of ‘unique entries in the ESTC database,’ the most popular author of the decade is by far Great Britain, followed by Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain, and King George III. Paine, More, Wesley and Shakespeare are only able to rise to our notice if we intervene in the dataset to filter out all authors whose names contain the phrase “Great Britain”; otherwise, Shakespeare is outnumbered by the House of Lords and by the Church of England. These claims demonstrate that a poorly-formed question will produce a useless and stupid answer even (or perhaps especially) if computation is used to answer it. This dissertation is dedicated to the formulation of better questions. I am interested in the limits of the generalizations that we make, both in “distant reading” research and in non-digital scholarship. I take as my starting point the contention that, in order to identify what is “popular” or “important,” we must also understand what is normal. At its core, my question is: given that it is not possible to read everything (or even most things), how do we, and how should we, determine what to read, preserve, study, and teach? This “question” is, of course, many questions: what we do is by no means what we should do; what we read is not necessarily what we study or teach. It is also an old, nearly an old-fashioned question. The current moment of self-reflection in the field of Digital Humanities, however, provides a timely reason to revisit it. Even literary scholars who do not carry out “Digital Humanities” research are impacted by the corpus-building choices of major digital resources, since all literary research is now mediated at some level by search algorithms and databases, even if this mediation is as small as looking up the holding libraries for physical copies of texts. It is therefore relevant to the field as a whole if, as I contend, corpus-building has become the new canon-building: an invisible and naturalized process of selecting texts for idiosyncratic and historically-specific reasons, and then treating those individual texts as ideal representatives of an imagined “whole” of literature. </Text>
            <Comments>More specifically, these “authors” are “Great Britain, Parliament,” “Great Britain,” “Great Britain, Parliament, House of Commons,” “Great Britain, Lords Commissioners of Appeals in Prize Causes,” and King George III. After King George comes Thomas Paine and Hannah More, and then it’s “Great Britain, Parliament, House of Lords” and “Church of England.”
, which still frequently relies on claims that a given work was “popular” because it went through a certain number of editions, or the author was paid a certain amount, and so on. These generalizations break down in part because “popular,” as a concept, is overdetermined: does it mean financially successful, or widely beloved, or important? Examinations of “popularity” also break down, at close scrutiny, because of the contentious relationship between concepts of “popular” and “literary”: important literature should have some claim to cultural relevance, but it shouldn’t be too popular or it becomes suspect.

            <Title>ch 2 - mainstream press</Title>
            <Text>Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade.
One thread of inquiry is simply to recover contemporary printing practices: who was printing what, and when? What role do chapbooks and religious tracts play? Do our archives simply replicate the output of the major publishing houses?
 Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? If possible, I would also like to examine theatrical production through this framework. Given the heightened ephemerality of theatre, it seems likely that the re-staging of an older play will be even more interestingly shaped by its potential to provide a timely response to the context in which it is re-staged.
A second thread of inquiry shaped by this attention to mainstream print production is to examine celebrity via print culture. Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather that nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare how famous various literary celebrities were over the course of the decade. The technical challenge for this part of the project is to define a feasible and fruitful metric of celebrity. In addition to looking at various raw publication counts, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. I will also discuss popularity more generally: after developing a few different metrics for popularity, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? Why does one corpus show one popular thing, and another show another?</Text>

            <Title>methods</Title>
            <Text>Before I develop custom code, I establish some baselines by taking a random sample of 100 titles from each of my key corpora. I manually identify the original publication date of each title, and whether that title appears reprinted elsewhere in the corpus.

As I expand to algorithmically examine the full corpora, I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words “Xth edition.”
If this method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ (as determined by comparison to my random sample) I won’t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles?
Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching… unless it’s small enough for me to do manually (unlikely)</Text>

            <Text>On the Grasshopper and Cricket

The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead
In summer luxury,--he has never done
With his delights; for when tired out with fun
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
On a lone winter evening, when the frost
Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

The above sonnet was written in competition with Leigh Hunt.

            <Text>“I have here followed the authors in counting playbooks rather than plays” (34)
“In the endnote itself I used the index totals only as numbers that reflect the increasing production” (35)
“Some items can be eliminated immediately because in the actual entries (and sometimes in the index itself ) they are identified as not really belonging in STC. Others, because of multiple, false, or misprinted dates, are indexed under two or more years, only one of which can be counted as “the right one” for that book. The authors may have eliminated at least some of these duplications but decline to say so. They do, however, point out that many numbered STC entries refer only to variants or reissues rather than to distinct editions and should be excluded. By their count these exclusions lower the total for those years by about 8 percent; my figure for the whole of 1583–1640 is fractionally higher at 8.5 percent.” (35)
“What makes it necessary to set aside many official publications—together with advertisements, blank forms, privately printed petitions, and the like—is not the commonplace circumstances of their printing but the more unusual fact that they were not intended to be sold wholesale to booksellers for resale to the general public.” “The few books printed for their authors can be reinstated without delay, because they differ from other speculative books only in that the speculators were not usually free of the Stationers’ Company.” “Surreptitious books (both Catholic and Puritan) differ in that profit was rarely the sole motive of whoever financed the printing. But it is quite unhistorical to imagine that such books were primarily intended to be given away.” “Some were sold privately to co-religionists by people outside the regular book trade; others under the counter by sympathetic booksellers. But anyone who doubts that recusant books were marketed in commercial quantities should contemplate The Manual of Prayers (STC 17263–17278.1), which went through twelve known editions in twenty-five years and another seventeen before 1641.” “The Manual of Prayers was therefore far more popular than any printed play.” (36) — I think he is overly simplistic about popularity here
“Up to this point the authors’ methodology has been generally straightforward and sensible. Start with the best-available raw numbers (STC), eliminate items that ought to be disqualified, and what remains should be the best-available approximation to the whole market. Divide by the number of playbooks, and the quotient should be the best-available approximation to their market share. I cannot fault either the approach or the results (provided that they are considered in toto rather than partially).” (37)
“four distinct arguments are offered, three of them included in the blanket claim that “patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (17). Two of those three are factually wrong.” (38) — this fight mostly seems to be about details that don't impact the 1790s
“virtually all the books protected by patent were works that had already been printed.15 It is true that no new publisher could compete for those titles, but that hardly amounted to “fundamentally different economic conditions than other books.” Most unpatented books that had been legally printed belonged to somebody” ““many copies of these books were sold to captive audiences, such as students, lawyers, or parish churches” (17). What this seems to imply is that purchases made by the wrong people or institutions, or for the wrong reasons (to study, or to use during church service), can be dismissed as reflecting the Wrong Sort of Demand” (39) 
“Market share in the real world is not always greatly affected by what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell, and is not determined at all by what academics subsequently choose to study. What counts is what the customers actually buy.” (40)
“It would have remained exactly the same book and would have been printed no less often—but the authors would not have been able to exclude it. So just how much can their distinction between “monopolistic” and other books really signify?” “Nobody had to buy the book” “People chose to buy it because they wanted to read, re-read, and sing its contents, not because some monopolist coerced them. Any serious discussion of which books sold best in early modern Britain would have to recognize that several of the most outstandingly popular were patented.” “any definition of popular that failed to include the Metrical Psalms—overwhelmingly the best-selling English book in both the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries—would be so wide of the mark as to render the word meaningless.” (41) — fundamentally, Farmer &amp; Lesser don’t claim that these plays were popular. They claim only that they were sound financial investments.
“the authors ignore an elementary arithmetical truism that completely vitiates their main conclusion. Simply put, a small percentage of a large number can be much bigger than a large percentage of a small number.” “The stubby column for sermon-books in figure 4 represents more than twice as many actual printed editions as does the imposing tower for the allegedly more popular playbooks. If reprinting denotes popularity, what should we conclude from the uncontested fact that more than twice as many sermon-books as playbooks went into at least a second edition?” “During that period the printers printed, the publishers wholesaled, and the customers in bookshops freely chose to buy more than three times as many sermon-books as playbooks.” “For my part I like to ensure that the valleys are not neglected, so I shall repeat that there were five years in which no playbooks were printed at all. But only once did the number of sermon-books drop below double figures (seven, in 1601).” (43) — I’m not wholly persuaded: if you're holding a book, and you want to know, "what are the odds that this book will reach a second edition?", it seems like Tomkis is a better bet than Shakey

“the authors are perfectly well aware of the facts and acknowledge that,“judging by market share, sermons do indeed appear to have been more popular than playbooks” (21). I am at a loss to understand how they nevertheless concluded that “sermons were reprinted much less frequently than were professional plays” (21)” “Of the playbooks of Edward Sharpham and of Thomas Tomkis, 100 percent reached third editions inside twenty years, but only 35 percent of Shakespeare’s fared as well. By the authors’ logic, Sharpham and Tomkis must have been far more popular—even though each man’s 100 percent (two out of two) was greatly outsold by Shakespeare’s 35 percent (eight out of twenty-three). Comparing percentages without regard to the quantities they represent can lead to absurd conclusions.” (44)
“More pertinently for the stationers, no more than 107 (32.2 percent), and perhaps only 104 (31.3 percent), were reprinted during the lifetimes of their first publishers” (45)
“should certainly be taken into account by anyone discussing those 785 publishers and arguing that they “must have found [playbooks] attractive investments.”” (46) — it's amazing that it's SO FEW publishers
“The figures also show that those playbooks account for 2.77 percent of the best-available approximation to the total market. Whether that is as much as 2.77 percent or a mere 2.77 percent depends on one’s outlook” (46)
“The apparent share could be artificially raised by adopting the methods by which the modern book trade constructs “top ten” lists that include only recently-published books of a specified kind.”

Anyone disinclined to believe that early modern readers could really have found books of divinity more desirable than Shakespeare quartos can easily check: choose a year at random and look up all the numbers listed for it in the STC chronological index (an exercise that should be required of every student beginning graduate work on early modern literature). No calculator will be needed to determine what pre- dominates: the vast quantity of religious material is impossible to overlook. It is not just the Bibles, testaments, liturgies, and psalters; not just the sermons and cate- chism after catechism—it is that even they are outnumbered by an interminable parade of admonitions, animadversions, annotations, answers, apologies, caveats, commentaries, conclusions, confutations, defences, dialogues, discourses, exhorta- tions, explications, expositions, guides, institutions, instructions, lectures, manuals, meditations, observations, paraphrases, prayers, preparatives, propositions, ques- tions, tractates, and (especially) treatises. Anyone unconvinced that the contents of a real bookshop could possibly have resembled those of STC should then hunt play- books in the 1616 inventory of the shop of John Foster of York.29 Customers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other “literary” publications. That is a fact of life, and it is pointless to try to evade it by juggling numbers or inventing specious reasons why certain best-sellers (such as Bibles, prayerbooks, or the Metrical Psalms) should not really count as books. Unless we recognize and accept just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers, we will never fully understand the background of the dramatic literature we now value so much more than they did. (7)
In the concluding paragraph of “Publication” I said that “I have . . . done what I can to make it difficult for future theorists to evade one inescapable fact about print- ed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been.”30 It seems that I had not done quite enough. Perhaps this paper will help to block any remaining escape routes. (47)
“I also flagged and coded all items that in my judgment were not printed for sale in bookshops.” (49)
“The titles are often little help: without being told, who would recognize The White Devil (STC 131), The King’s Shoe (STC 16686), or A Royal Edict for Military Exercises (STC 6313) as sermons, or Bowels Opened (STC 22476) as a collection of twenty?” (49)
“Other than asking it to count the records for 1640, 1641, and 1642, I have not consulted ESTC for this study. Since I criticized the inadequacies of its early modern records five years ago, there have been changes.” (49) — “Peter W. M. Blayney, untitled letter, The Library: The Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, 7th ser., 1 (2000): 72–74.”
“In the table I have deliberately falsified the numbers for 1641–42.” (50) “Anyone who thinks it would have been more appropriate to treat the nine playbooks of 1641–42 as a percentage of 6,356 (0.1 percent) instead of 1,108 (0.8 percent) is probably right.” (50)

            <Text>Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.</Text>

My dissertation seeks to determine, at as minute a level of detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like (in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers), and how this print landscape persists in archives.</Text>

            <Text>A core object of study for this dissertation, then, is the makeup and history of contemporary digital databases. Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes. I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg and HathiTrust. My examination of these six databases will, of necessity, examine a ‘time capsule’ of their holdings at a particular moment; the sources of my data, and my procedures for working with them, are described in more detail in Appendix B (“Methodology”). The databases vary from each other in terms of two main qualities: their size, and their reputation. The reputation of any given digital resource is shaped largely, I argue, by its ability to signal ‘rigour’ in its collection practices. Several databases of different sizes have established reputations of seriousness, and, correspondingly, cultural capital within scholarly communities. The databases that I will examine at length form two groupings of three each, to explore two sets of related concepts. The first set consists of ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP, all of which follow the same rigorous collection practices at different scales. The second set consists of Google Books, HathiTrust, and Project Gutenberg, which follow very different collection practices while sharing a dubious scholarly reputation.</Text>

            <Title>Garnai, Revolutionary Imaginings in the 1790s</Title>
            <Text>Mary Robinson

“Even as she published six novels, several collections of poetry and various political and prose tracts, she could never escape from the burden of an unremitting social notoriety” (69)

“This pattern of reception — with its foregrounding of the ubiquitous sexual narrative — extended well into the twentieth century; it was Robinson’s status as ‘Perdita’ which created a interest in her life and writing and invested them with cultural currency, with biographical studies plotting her life mainly around the axis of emotional engagement … This kind of biographical/historical assessment has received a recent corrective with the publication of Paula Byrne’s biography of Robinson. While chronicling a life of celebrity… Byrne also provides a serious discussion of her authorship.” (70)

“There was, however, another pattern of reception that accompanied the publication of Robinson’s work in her own time as well. There, her support of radical issues did attract attentuon … The comments of Mathias, Heath, Bisset, Gifford, and Polwhele are significant, as they point to a contemporary awareness of, and identification between, Robinson and a certain political strand. And yet, in dissociating Robinson’s politics from her poetry, Gifford also expresses a critical view … that links her radicalism exclusively to her later novels. Thus, while for these observers Robinson’s public presence was more than that of actress, mistress, and celebrity, they ignore the political import of the texts that she wrote during the early 1790s, when she was conspicuously under the burden of celebrity status.” (71)

“an identification with victimhood at times displaces the adherence to a specific political agenda, such as in Robinson’s support of and identification with Marie Antoinette” (71) — is ‘adherence to an agenda’ the right way to think about politics?

“Anne Mellow, in presenting Robinson as a ‘script of female sexuality’, has argued that the different ways Robinson’s subjectivity was constructed in contemporary narratives as well as her performative enactment of authorship indicate that ‘her identity — personal and authorial — can be nothing more nor less than the sum total of / the scripts she performed both in public and in private, n her own narratives and in those of others.’ Mellor’s recognition of the fluidity of Robinson’s authorial identity [NOTE: FLUIDITY IS NOT WHAT MELLOR DESCRIBES] is underscored most forcefully in the ways that Robinson affixes her name to her published work. The fact that her writing was disseminated under various names and personae (Laura Maria, Oberon and Tabitha Bramble, among others) as well as anonymously, contributes to the sense of ‘performance’ that accompanies her literary career, and complicates the attempt to locate the presence of a political awareness in its aggregate.” (71-2)</Text>

            <Text>Bill Readings
“Guillory seems almost to have rephrased Harold Bloom’s account of the anxiety of influence in sociological terms: literary culture emerges as always already anxious about its own waning influence, torn between a general claim about culture and a need to restrict that culture in order to preserve or restore its purity, to establish its distinctiveness and assure its status as cultural capital.” (Readings 322)
“As Balibar and others have insisted, the canon is a false problem, if we only ask what it contains and neglect the social forms of distribution that it implies. We need to look at the syllabus, the curriculum, and the educational system,refusing of the pretensions of the canon either to represent a culture or to present an inclusive account of cultures.” (Readings 322)
“Guillory argues that political economy and aesthetics emerge as parallel discourses structured by their mutual forgetting of the other’s notion of value and by the struggle to distinguish the work of art from the commodity (317)” (Readings 322)
“Guillory pointedly criticizes Smith for not having paid sufficient attention to Kant: she conflates aesthetics with aesthetic value and, like the Marxist critic Tony Bennet, takes value to be a property of the object rather than, as Kant argues, a matter of subjectivejudgment (276)” (Readings 322)
“The issue here is not Guillory’sscholarship but whether his theoretical framework can successfully address the literary curriculum.” (Readings 323)
“Chapter 1 calls for an analysis of the “systematicconstitution and distribution of cultural capital” as part of a “project of political integration” (82).Chapters z and 3 perform such analyses,yet do not reveal how an understanding of literature as cultural capital will lead to a reconception of the literary curriculum, let alone to political integration. In this sense they seem curiously parasitical on the system they expose and denounce. Chapter 4, on the canonization of literary theory, ends by demanding a reconceptualization of the object of literary study without suggesting what direction this might take (265). Likewise, after attacking institutional pedagogy, denouncing charismatic teaching and the role of affect, and finding in de Man and Lacan’s demands for rigor “the desire that the disciplesform a church” ( 2 0 2 ) ,Guillory offers no account of an alternative pedagogy.” (Readings 324)
“Guillory falls into the same trap he detects in Leavis: adversarial culture is devoted to its own effacement, since success means failure (loss of adversarial status)” (Readings 324)
“Every critique of the system is shown to be a move within the system … An other to the system is unthinkable. Hence, what is proposed is not an alternative but the more equal redistribution of capital within the system, which Guillory thematizes as increased “access”to cultural goods.” (Readings 324)
“After several hundred dense pages these closing words make a rather particular claim for the redemptive power of the aesthetic. They suggest that we are not yet ready for Kant, that only after Marx has done his work and the means of production and consumption have been socialized can we really be Kantians, harmlessly engaging in the freeplay of aesthetic judgment.” (Readings 325)
“The apparent plea for the relative autonomy of the aesthetic turns out to be a strong privileging of the economic base: only when social inequality has been set aside does aestheticjudgment become free. Aestheticism is thus unbound because the differences it makes will no longer be real, dire differences.” (Readings 325)
“Only when analyses are entirely restricted within national frontiers can cultural capital seem fungible. Translatability is not a given: instead of describing cultural capital as the currency of a national totality, one has to ask “prestigefor whom?”Since culture is no longer one game but many heterogeneous games, there is no ready-made answer.” (Readings 326)
“From this perspective, the underside of Guillory’s rephrasing of the canon debate in terms of the distribution of cultural capital appears. Does not the appeal to cultural capital finally mask the desire to preserve the nation state as the fundamental unit of cultural analysis, in a world in which global fusion (Wallerstein’s “geo-culture”) and national fission threaten its status? Is the nation-state-withering in the face of the Trans-National corporation-perhaps no longer the primary instance of the reproduction of capital?” (Readings 326)

            <Title>what I'm doing here</Title>
            <Text>The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus is not without grounds. As this dissertation will explore in depth, challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new “great unread.” Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. For example, the English Short Title Catalogue records 51,965 titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799. The corpus most commonly used for DH work on eighteenth century literature, ECCO-TCP, includes only 466 titles for that same time period. What are the other 51,499 titles, why are they accessible in the ways they are, and what does it mean for digital eighteenth century studies that they are not included? Although the examination of databases prompts similar hypotheses of exclusion as in longstanding conversations about canons, digital databases do not simply replicate new canons. [By the end of my dissertation, I will be able to state here what IS happening — something structured by related logics of access and prestige, and related simplifications of historical complexity, and related institutional replication of privileged texts.. But very importantly different, too, since we don’t read databases.] In a series of computational and non-computational research processes, I examine six databases of eighteenth century texts to learn about four eighteenth century authors, and I examine four eighteenth century authors to learn about eighteenth century databases. This dissertation, therefore, takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship shaping my frameworks, and then introduce my chapters by introducing my four case study authors.</Text>

Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.</Text>

            <Text>Despite the fact that Cronin’s chief interest is in each poet’s use of language to construct an ideal audience, print culture looms. Of Erasmus Darwin, Cronin emphasizes Darwin’s use of “[t]he most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status,” namely, “the language of science” (16), but it is the “beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden” (29) which asserts his importance. Blake’s eccentric, idiosyncratic language is mirrored in his eccentric, idiosyncratic printing practices (60). Southey and Landor’s universal, international language seeks to “escape from history” (81), which entails disavowing not only the popular prose fictions which sought to represent history but also the very circulating libraries in which they were distributed (74). In other words, Cronin, even more so than Bainbridge, seems to use ‘poetic language’ to explain phenomena which have important print culture dimensions.</Text>

            <Text>Review Reviewed Work(s): Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation by John Guillory Review by: Jan Gorak Source: Modern Philology, Vol. 94, No. 2 (Nov., 1996), pp. 286-290 Published by: The University of Chicago Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/437977 Accessed: 01-06-2019 21:45 UTC 
Gorak has particularly good summaries of Guillory’s arguments within individual chapters, esp. his close readings.
“Impatient with the frustrating course of the current debate, the author wants to expand and, in expanding, change utterly the terms of that debate. Rather than increase the number of works taught in the classroom, Guillory wants to widen access to the school. Without universal access to the school, he suggests, entry to the literary canon appears a cruel irrelevance, a key that promises entry to the palace of art but leads only to the dungeon. In an expanded school system, however, canons wither away or dwindle to less imposing significance. For once the school becomes the construction site for diverse and autonomous communities embarked on an ongoing process of judgment and creation, then there is no need for a special class of cultural monuments that carry special privileges. "Reschooling society" tolls the knell for monumental canons, and maybe even for art itself; but it rings in the arrival of any equitable social order. This is how Guillory's last chapter wraps up his bold "thought experiment" (p. 340).” (Gorak 287) — I don’t think she totally got it?
“Such idealistic hopes for the school of the future will almost obli- gatorily involve an author in some harsh verdicts on the schools of the past and the present. In an opening chapter that matches the breadth of his last, Guillory demonstrates how canonizers and canon busters are both locked into the restrictive notion of "representation" that has tacitly controlled the contemporary controversy about the canon. "Representation," he argues, leads to the politics of the image, where a few "marginal" authors find their way into classrooms still in- habited by a privileged social and ethnic minority. "Representation" overlooks the demographic composition and social functions of the institutions responsible for instruction in public literacy and advanced literary study that Guillory labels "the school.”” (Gorak 287)
“By now it is clear that Guillory has constructed his case studies to convict literary studies of abdicating from the public space. Hence it appropriate that the third case study should turn to Paul de Man, the Captain Grimes of the Yale graduate program, whose wartime journalism supplies further evidence of the political deficiencies of the twen- tieth-century literary mind” (Gorak 289)
“The cribbed, cabined, confined condition of the English Studies bequeathed by the de Man legacy clears a vast space for the emanci- pation narrative unfolded in Guillory's last chapter.” (289)
“Guillory's classroom without walls is something few educators at a time of shrinking budgets, declining enrollments, and burgeoning radicalism will find it in their hearts to resist. I wonder, however, whether a work on the problem of literary canon formation can pro- ceed in the way Guillory's does. It is surely the case that people who produce art and people responsible for teaching it both form canons. It is surely the case, too, that from Thomas Love Peacock to Ezra Pound the first group of people have rarely venerated the contribution made by the second. But the importance of artists, so central to much of Bourdieu's work, is something Guillory barely registers, nor does he make an adequate inventory of the range of textual operations per- formed in the literature departments of twentieth-century schools. Consequently, Cultural Capital launches its broad utopian projections from a dangerously narrow base.” (Gorak 290)</Text>

            <Title>overall goal</Title>
            <Text>Having described a large and complex scholarly context for this work, and made some preliminary efforts toward synthesis of these disparate backgrounds, it is time, now, to describe the work undertaken here in more detail. This dissertation examines the literature of the 1790s through the lens of ‘titles.’ Throughout this work, a ‘title’ is the broadest possible umbrella term for a text: it is synonymous with ‘a database entry which I believe to represent a printed work.’ I draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), HathiTrust, ProQuest, the British Library’s Nineteenth Century Book Corpus (BL), the Early Novels Database (END), Gale’s digitized microfiche of the Corvey collection, Google Books, the Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg. Each individual database will shape the precise correspondences between a ‘title’ and the printed texts about which I use ‘titles’ to reason. For example, it will vary based on my source whether multiple editions of the same work are several ‘titles’ or one ‘title,’ and whether the titles exclusively represent ‘books’ or also include chapbooks, broadsheets, or even ephemera. Due to the inscrutability of much digital infrastructure, it is often not possible for me to know prior to experimentation what kinds of titles I am working with. These variations form part of my object of inquiry. Substantial time is taken to establish the history and constraints of each of these resources to contextualize the role they play in contemporary digital research. Using the information they make most readily accessible, I explore which works and individuals emerge as ‘popular’ or ‘important’ in each resource. I also probe each resource for its representation of (or failure to represent) my touchstone authors, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson. The resulting findings are primarily used to evaluate how the underlying digital resources participate in or resist the projects of canon-building. Then, there is a ‘turn,’ where I introduce programs of my own design to repurposes these materials. These experiments are then used to draw conclusions about 1790s print culture.</Text>

            <Title>proposal</Title>
            <Text>Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.</Text>
            <Comments>TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2nd or 10th edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.
Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.</Comments>

            <Text>Women’s Writing in the Eighteenth Century: Evaluating ‘Representative’ Corpora

When we study literature through text mining, our conclusions are not based on an examination of “literature” itself, but on the corpus which is a sample or model of the imagined whole of “literature.” Despite the importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of text mining research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of corpora which re-create social inequalities.
As an eighteenth century scholar, I examine five corpora which are used as the basis of most eighteenth century distant reading: the English Short Title Catalogue database; Eighteenth Century Collections Online; the Eighteenth Century Collections Online  Text Creation Partnership; Project Gutenberg; and HathiTrust. I manually evaluate each corpus’s holdings for a narrow sample of texts, works published in England 1789-99, to investigate and contextualize their representation of female authors. For this eleven-year period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? 
In addition to calculating the gender ratio of authorship for each of the five corpora (including an assessment of the unsigned or unattributable works), I correlate gender with the basic categories of writing present in the corpus, to form more specific conclusions about the role of gender in corpus-building. Simple topic-modelling of the titles of eighteenth century works allows me to identify broad categories such as plays, poetry, pamphlets, novels, songs, sermons, ephemera, and so on. Titles in the eighteenth century are long, and served as advertisements, intentionally created to actively communicate this level of information about their works’ contents: although topic modelling of titles would not be sufficient in other centuries, it is remarkably effective here. Identifying the representation within each corpus of these categories of writing reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry in the smaller corpora.
This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller corpora. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of exclusion. Asking bibliographical questions of multiple corpora, in order to learn about the corpora themselves, emphasizes an under-examined stage of text mining research, and provides a basis for other scholars to use these corpora more precisely. Asking pointed questions about gender, in particular, may allow future users of these corpora to address some impacts of historical sexism.</Text>

            <Text>Robinson’s public stature fell sharply after her death. Behrendt’s comparison of posthumous reviews of Robinson’s work with reviews of Charlotte Smith’s work highlights the fact that “unlike Smith she was widely regarded as the instigator rather than the victim of her misfortunes” (192), due to the ‘immorality’ of her choices; as a result, her claims to sympathy and sensibility are dismissed by early nineteenth century reviewers. Behrendt argues that her “notorious public behaviour seems to have ensured that she would not get anything like a fair hearing as an artist among the conventional critics of the time. Her case is a painful reminder of the pervasive power of a self-appointed coterie of predominantly male critics who considered themselves custodians of national public morality” (192). Susan Civale’s work on Robinson’s immediate nineteenth century reception bears out this dismissal of Robinson “as an artist” (Behrendt 192). Civale highlights the disparity between Robinson’s poetry and fiction and her Memoirs: even after Robinson’s other works had fallen out of print, the Memoirs continued to be reprinted, and to spur new writing in the form of “reviews, essays, spin-off novels, illustrations, poems, mini-biographies, entries in multibiographies, and citations in the life writing of other key figures” (194). It was Robinson’s biography, rather than her writing, which “continued to interest, perplex, and charm readers” (Civale 194).
When literary scholars began to be interested again in Robinson in the 1990s, their work continued to be shaped by an intense awareness of her personal life and her theatrical career, often examining her works for the performance of Robinson’s identity communicated within them. [For example, Judith Pascoe’s 1997 Romantic Theatricality - “According to Pascoe, Robinson enacted in her writing an ever-shifting public identity” (Cross 6).] [Also Susan Luther, Stuart Curran, Eleanor Ty, and Sharon Setzer]. The theatrical performance of celebrity remains, as Ashley Cross argues, “the dominant lens through which her writing and her career have been interpreted” (6). The other major lens is Robinson’s interaction with other Romantic poets, “in particular her relations with Coleridge and the Della Cruscans, to a lesser extent Wordsworth and, more recently, Southey and Smith” (Cross 6). This examination of the poetic Robinson nonetheless often employs the same framings as work on the theatrical celebrity Robinson, in emphasizing the strategic development of personae for public attention. Cross argues that “[t]he  publication  of  the  eight-volume  complete  Works  by  Mary  Robinson  by  Pickering  and  Chatto  (2009–2010),  under  the  direction  of  William  Brewer,  marked  Robinson’s  official  reentrance  into  the  literary  canon” (12), [but is she really “in” the canon as an artist?]</Text>

            <Text>Fry, Carrol L. Charlotte Smith. Twayne’s English Authors Series, edited by Herbert Sussman, Twayne, 1996.

“No writer’s works more clearly chart the shifts in British culture and the flow of ideas in politics and art during this time of change than do those of Charlotte Turner Smith. She was one of the most popular writers of the final two decades of the 18th century and among the most prolific. Her first three novels established the conventions that dominated the sentimental and gothic novel of the 1790s. Her early poetry, like her first novels, reflects 18th-century tastes, but her later poems place her in the forefront of the romantic movement.” (2)
“In her later work, Smith used her fiction and poetry as vehicles for the presentation of political ideas. Both her life and her art epitomize the ‘wrongs of woman’ in the 18th century. Aware that her audience was largely female and that young women received little education, she sought to inform her readers on the important issues of her day.” (2)

“By the end of her life, Charlotte Smith has developed not only into one of the finest poets of her day and a novelist who expanded the horizons of fiction but also into a writer whose works epitomize the romantic sensibility of the early 19th century.” (3)

“Few writers have presented themselves in their works so fully as did Charlotte Smith.” (3) &lt;- there’s more here</Text>

            <Text>Chapter 4 of this dissertation examines the works of Ann Radcliffe across several digital corpora. Ann Radcliffe is selected as a contrasting model of popularity, as a famous and popular author with a relatively short list of publications in only one genre. Radcliffe is a particularly useful case study author to contest the relevance of “editions” as a marker of popularity: many of the later editions of her works had very large print runs, since the works were sure to sell, such that a decline in reissues is in fact a sign of success rather than failure. The precise details of these editions and their implications occupy much of chapter 4, and provide important complications for the models of popularity and legacy developed with Charlotte Smith and Mary Robinson in chapters 2 and 3. Radcliffe’s first publication is at the beginning of this dissertation’s decade of interest: in 1789, Radcliffe published her first novel, The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, which reached five London editions by the time of her death. In 1790, she published A Sicilian Romance, which reached six London editions. In 1792, The Romance of the Forest, which reached eight London editions. This novel earned her more positive notice and began the momentum for her career: it is after the success of The Romance of the Forest that her first two novels reached their second editions. In 1794, Radcliffe published her fourth novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho, which had two London editions that year, and reached twelve London editions by her death. In 1795, Radcliffe published her only non-novel work, the travelogue A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794, which saw two editions in London that year and a third before her death. In 1797, she published the last new novel to be released during her lifetime, The Italian, which reached a second edition before her death. After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Radcliffe’s works continued to be reprinted domestically and internationally nearly every year, but she ceased publishing new works. In 1802, Radcliffe wrote, but did not publish, Gaston de Blondville, which would finally appear in print posthumously in 1826. In 1816, a “new” publication appeared: an unauthorized volume Poems by Mrs Ann Radcliffe, anthologizing poems previously appearing in her novels. Radcliffe died in February of 1823. This prompted reprints of all of her works by S. Fisher in 1823, and by Ballantyne in 1824. In 1826, her husband published several pieces posthumously: Gaston de Blondeville; a poetic piece St. Alban’s Abbey ...To which is prefixed a memoir of the author; and, in New Monthly Magazine, her unfinished essay “On the Supernatural in Poetry.”</Text>
            <Comments>Radcliffe was paid £500 for this work, which was a highly-anticipated sensation (Facer)
She was paid £800 for The Italian.</Comments>

            <Title>critical algorithm studies</Title>
            <Text>What’s crucial, to use computational reading reparatively, is to use it reflectively. The desirable kinds of computation which I describe above will not happen inevitably. Here I draw upon the rich body of work emerging in critical algorithm studies, which examines (and attempts to reform) the human elements of computational algorithms. Any methodology is, to a certain extent, an “algorithm,” in the loose definition of ‘a series of pre-defined steps to be carried out’. But computational algorithms differ from “algorithms” implemented by humans. Computational algorithms have two key vulnerabilities: first, their operations are less easily scrutinized; second, their results are more easily trusted. The second vulnerability — the cultural aura of empirical trustworthiness which accrues to anything ‘computational’ — is another flavour of the same vulnerability that Drucker describes with ‘data’ generally. Because the human agents who designed and trained any given algorithm appear to be absent from its operation, the algorithm appears able to discover truth directly. This is how Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra was able to tweet with disdain that “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claims that algorithms, which are driven by math, are racist” (@RealSaavedra): anything “driven by math,” he assumes, must be incapable of human fallibilities like racism. But as Safiya Noble shows extensively in Algorithms of Oppression, algorithms by default reproduce, and can easily exaggerate, the assumptions and biases of the culture in which they are made (CITE). In other words, in a racist world, algorithms are racist — and sexist, and duplicative of all other systemic inequities.

            <Text>historian John Barrell’s Imagining the King’s Death (2000). This is a massive and complex book, again written from a Marxist perspective, focussing on the period from the French regicide in 1793 to the British treason trials of 1794–95.It investigates how agents of the British state sought to make the act of imagining the King’s death a treasonable offence. Their argument was that thinking and writing about revolution would promote it, and revolutions, as the French example showed, killed kings. Many (including the juries who tried those arrested for ‘thoughtcrimes’ like these) could not agree, but Barrell shows how both conservatives and radicals engaged with the argument about the political power of imagination. </Text>

            <Title>How do people determine popularity?</Title>
            <Text>	1.	(Reprinting) Simon Bainbridge: best-selling, most-reprinted, most-adapted
	2.	(Assertion) George Taylor: simply asserts that some things are popular
	3.	(Assertion) Peter Murphy: despite promising that his study “examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history,” Murphy says NOTHING AT ALL about how well, to whom, for how much, etc etc things were sold.
	4.	(Performances) Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, et al.: number of performances per play (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory)
	5.	(Book history) Cronin: mostly asserts that people are “popular” or “celebrated”; with Erasmus Darwin, supports this by saying that the book The Botanic Garden is beautiful &amp; expensive
	6.	(Editions, reprints, market share, profitability) Lesser &amp; Farmer, Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade - “we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)
	7.	(Market share) Blayney
	8.	(Title counts) MacLeod on the Minerva press — evaluates most popular authors &amp; subgenres based on the number of “works published” or “titles” (unclear if this includes reprints)
	9.	(Reprints, anthologizing, “influence”) p 193: assessing Smith’s importance based on page counts anthologized in 1833 Specimens of English Sonnets and Specimens of British Poetesses. “it is clear from sonnets like Bowles’s, Coleridge’s, Wordsworth’s, Opie’s, Hanson’s, Dark’s, Keats’s, and even Anna Seward’s that her influence was wide, formative, and powerful, just as it was in prose fiction for novelists like Austen, Radcliffe, Opie, Scott and others. Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain)” (Behrendt 201).
	10.	(Reprints, “emulation”) “During her lifetime Charlotte Smith was a literary celebrity: her Elegiac Sonnets and Other Poems (1784) were continuously reprinted and wifely emulated.” (Duckling 203)

            <Text>George Taylor, in The French Revolution and the London Stage, sets forth some key contentions about literature’s cultural capital. He argues that although eighteenth-century critics sought to make distinctions in the social value of different plays, or different parts of the theatrical program at a single show, audiences did not make these distinctions. “Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery,” he argues, the division was purely physical: “all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all […] all received plaudits from all corners of the house” (3). Although reviewers in the eighteenth century sought to police class boundaries in their discussions of the theatre, these critiques operated like the critiques of Gothic fiction which Gamer analyzes: [SUM THEM UP AGAIN HERE.]</Text>

I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers.

            <Text>“The most interesting question raised by the debate is not the familiar one of which texts or authors will be included in the literary canon, but the question of why the debate represents a crisis in literary study.” (Vii)
“I will argue that evaluative judgments are the necessary but not sufficient condition for the process of canon formation, and that it is only by understanding the social function and institutional protocols of the school that we will understand how works are preserved, reproduced, and disseminated over successive generations and centuries. Similarly, where the debate speaks about the canon as representing or failing to represent particular social groups, I will speak of the school's historical function of distributing, or regulating access to, the forms of cultural capital.” (Vii)
“while the debate seems to its participants to be about the contents of the literary canon, its significance goes well beyond the effects of any new consensus about a truly "representative" canon. The canon debate signifies nothing less than a crisis in the form of cultural capital we call "literature."” (Viii)
“The theory of cultural capital implies that the proper social context for analyzing the school and its literary curriculum is class.” (Viii)
“If there exists a form of capital which is specifically symbolic or cultural, the production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of this capital presupposes the division of society into groups that can be called classes. Bourdieu's sociology assumes such a division, but it does not assume that an economic account of classes is sufficient in itself.1 Such an account would omit precisely what in Bourdieu's theory is "cultural."” (Viii)
“The fact of class determines whether and how individuals gain access to the means of literary production, and the system regulating such access is a much more efficient mechanism of social exclusion than acts of judgment.” (Ix)
“By foregrounding the question of the relation between social groups and the means of literary production, I have thus attempted to resist the easy assumption that whatever one says about race and gender goes without saying for class too.” (Ix)
“In the case of the literary curriculum, I propose that the problem of what is called canon formation is best understood as a problem in the constitution and distribution of cultural capital, or more specifically, a problem of access to the means of literary production and consumption. The "means" in question are provided by the school, which regulates and thus distributes cultural capital unequally.” (Ix)
“The literary syllabus is the institutional form by means of which this knowledge is disseminated, and it constitutes capital in two senses: First, it is linguistic capital, the means by which one attains to a socially credentialed and therefore valued speech” (ix)
“And second, it is symbolic capital, a kind of knowledge-capital whose possession can be displayed upon request and which thereby entitles its possessor to the cultural and material rewards of the well-educated person.” (Ix)
““I regard these two kinds of capital as ultimately more socially significant in their effects than the "ideological" content of literary works, a content which the critics of the canon see as reinforcing the exclusion of minority authors from the canon by expressing the same values which determine exclusionary judgments. Literary works must be seen rather as the vector of ideological notions which do not inhere in the works themselves but in the context of their institutional presentation, or more simply, in the way in which they are taught.”” (Ix)
“That category organizes the literary curriculum in such a way as to create the illusion of a fixed and exclusive ‘canon,’ an illusion which is belied by the real history of literary curricula in the schools.” (X)
““calling the canon into question has failed to inaugurate a historico-critical inquiry into the category of literature, even while it has registered a crisis in the cultural capital so denominated”” (x)
“The context of the first case study is the institution of a vernacular literary curriculum in the primary schools of the eighteenth century.” (X)
“the first crisis in the status of the vernacular canon, the problem of assimilating new vernacular genres such as the novel. Wordsworth and Coleridge responded to this crisis with a programmatic attempt to reaffirm the High Cultural status of traditional canonical works in English against, on the one hand, popular novels and narrative poetry, and, on the other, the quasi-Latinate "poetic diction" supposed to have characterized especially the work of Gray. The effect of that program, which was of course shared by a literary culture much larger than the circle of Wordsworth and Coleridge, was to reserve the term "literature" for High Canonical works, and in this way to maintain the cultural capital of those works.”” (Xi)
“an account of the emergence of literary study such as that provided by Gerald Graff in his invaluable Professing English.” (Xi)
“I have constructed the second case study around a moment in which the vernacular curriculum in the university became strongly distinguished from the curriculum in the primary and secondary levels. This was the moment of the great canonical reformation of the New Critics.” (Xi) - Chapter 3
“Chapter 4 turns to the highest level of the educational system, the graduate school, where in the last twenty-five years the literary syllabus has been supplemented by a list of texts which effectively circulate as a "canon of theory."” (Xii)
“The fact that today we so easily recognize the names of the master theorists confirms the emergence of these names as a "canon" supplementing the canon of literature in the graduate schools, and testifies to the perceived inadequacy of the / literary syllabus to constitute a program of study complete in itself.” (xii - xiii)
“attempt to redirect the focus of the debate away from the question of who is in or out of the canon to the question of the canonical form in its social and institutional contexts” (xiii)
“The form we call "literature" organizes the syllabus and determines criteria of selection much more directly than the particular social biases of judgment which have been invoked to explain the canonical or noncanonical status of particular authors.” (Xiii)
“In the final chapter of this book I argue that the extrapolation of a critique of aesthetics from the critique of the canon is mistaken in its fundamental premise.” (Xiii)
“The value-concept has a history of which the canon debate remains unaware, and which needs to be recovered before one sets out to critique the concept of a specifically "aesthetic" value. I proceed in Chapter 5 to reconstruct the historical relation between aesthetics and political economy in order to demonstrate the origin of the value-concept in the struggle to distinguish the work of art from the commodity.” (Xiii)
“the production and distribution of cultural works as cultural capital cannot be explained by making no distinction between cultural and material capital.” (Xiv)
“the specificity of aesthetic judgment is not on this view simply an illusion to be exploded, but rather a privileged site for reimagining the relation between the cultural and the economic in social life.” (Xiv)
“The strangest consequence of the canon debate has surely been the discrediting of judgment, as though human beings could ever refrain from judging the things they make.” (Xiv)
“The most politically strategic argument for revising the canon remains the argument that the works so revalued are important and valuable cultural works. If literary critics are not yet in a position to recognize the inevitability of the social practice of judgment, that is a measure of how far the critique of the canon still is from developing a sociology of judgment. The theory of cultural capital elaborated in this book is an attempt to construct just such a sociology.” (Xiv)

Footnotes
“The concept of class is as controverted as any other notion in social theory, and the class analysis I propose in this book will not wait for any definitive resolution of that controversy. Here I can only point to the larger features on the map in order to situate my own analysis (and Bourdieu's) in something like a region of this domain. For Marx and Marxism, class is defined by position in the relations of production, and there are only two of these: capital and labor; alternatively, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat (the existence of a "petty bourgeoisie" does not alter the dualism of this structure). The rigor of this model, which apprehends class distinction in eco- nomic terms, leaves largely unresolved the question of how cultural distinctions are articulated on the template of the capital-labor structure. The solution to this prob- lem is ultimately what is at stake in every class analysis, including Bourdieu's. For the tradition of "bourgeois" sociology (Durkheim and Weber are as important in Bourdieu's theory as the work of Marx), class is primarily a cultural concept, al- though the expression of many cultural class traits will in practice depend on mate- rial resources. With the concept of"cultural capital" Bourdieu undertakes a certain negotiation between the domains of the economy and culture. Without pronounc- ing on the success of this negotiation, I would insist here that the aporia between the cultural and the economic is the most fundamental problem confronted by bour- geois sociology, as well as by that hypothetical "Marxist" sociology which Marx himself never produced. For Bourdieu's own account of the concept of capital, see "The Forms of Capital," in The Handbook of Theory and Research for the Soci- ology of Education, ed. John G. Richardson (New York: Greenweed Press, 1983), 241-58. Rather than offer here a precise definition of cultural capital, I have fol- lowed Bourdieu's own practice in constructing the concept through the contexts of its deployment.” (341)
“The concept ofthe "New Class" invokes Alvin Gouldner, The Future ofIntellec- tuals and the Rise of the New Class (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979). The "professional-managerial class" invokes the groundbreaking essay of Barbara and John Ehrenreich, "The Professional-Managerial Class," in Between Labor and / Capital, ed. Pat Walker (Montreal: Black Rose Press, 1979). The controversy in the Walker volume over the question of whether the group of professional-managerial workers constitutes a class is scarcely settled in that volume. The Ehrenreichs pro- ceed on the assumption that a class has both an economic and a cultural compo- nent, neither of which can be simply derived from, or reduced to, the other. This working assumption makes for a less than tidy theory of class, but the Ehrenreichs are not especially disturbed by this untidiness. Gouldner's conception of cultural capital casts the New Class in the role of a new bourgeoisie, the historical suc- cessors to t~eold. I have kept Gouldner's theory in mind, somewhat warily, prefer- ring Bourdieu's less narrativizing mode of class analysis. For the more limited purposes of the argument I wish to make in this book, it perhaps does not matter whether the professional-managerial classes are conceived to be a distinct class, or, as Erik Olin Wright argues in his response to the Ehrenreichs in the Walker volume, a "contradictory location within class relations" (203). What matters to the present argument is that the emergence of the professional-managerial class has enor- mously altered the constitution and distribution of cultural capital in the school system, and that these new conditions remain the unremarked horizon of the canon debate.” (341-342)

            <Text>My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see how much we do know about the chapbook trade. I am particularly interested in the cycle of responses between pamphlets, and whether there are geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness. This chapter will of course address Hannah More’s Cheap Repository Tracts, but I am equally curious about the works among which hers were sold. My “case study” could trace the printing and circulation of one of More’s pamphlets and a few of its fellow-travellers, as the foundation for a discussion of More’s hybrid literary forms. </Text>

            <Text>Leavis and New Critics want literature to create a “literary sensibility” in people
	•	even though Leavis and New Critics had different ideological values, they could agree on canon reassessment because "the two movements could be seen to provide different solutions to the same social or cultural problems.” (135)
	•	"the revaluation of vernacular works in English as the equivalent of the Greek and Roman classics provided the emergent bourgeoisie with a means of emulating the cultural capital of the aristocratic and clerical estates. The project of installing a 'literary sensibility' in the largest possible constituency was on the contrary intended to have the social function of neutralizing the very political ideologies which set the classes in opposition to one another. The literary sensibility was to unify the nation culturally just as Standard English was supposed to unify it linguistically.” (136)
	•	“literature itself can be installed as a sensibility that performs the social function of doxa— producing a state of cultural homogeneity, or unquestioned belief-- without ever requiring the 'imperfect' supplement of orthodoxy, without specifying directly what these beliefs are. Precisely because sensibility is not the same thing as belief, it is never subject to decay into mere orthodoxy." (138)

Their goal is literature as the new “doxa”
	•	"all ideology aspires to the condition of doxa" but instead encounters orthodoxy and heterodoxy ... “not even feudal culture managed to establish Christianity as a doxa, else there would have been no heresy in the Middle Ages” (137)
	•	"As a historical substitute for doxa, however, literature seems to stand in a relation of orthodoxy to beliefs that / are no longer dominant, that is, literature stands as a testament to the absence of doxa.” (137-8)
	•	“doxa (what is unquestioned, impensé) and what is openly advocated, an ‘orthodoxy.’” (157)

Actually, literature became less important, relegated to schools
	•	"literary culture and its institutions... so far from establishing a cultural doxa for the social order as a whole, or even establishing a potent ‘orthodoxy' on the basis of the literary canon, remained culturally marginal to the social formation of modernity." (139)
	•	“The school becomes the site at which the practice of reading can be cultivated in such a way as to preserve the cultural capital of literature (signified in the Brooksian allegory as a kind of /sacredness/), just because its social space can be conceived as a space of deliberate and strategic withdrawal, as the withdrawal of literary culture from 'the world’” (165)
	•	literary culture as partial substitution for clergy, semi-unsuccessful, esp as “The decline of the public sphere in the nineteenth century transforms the agents of literary culture into exclusively traditional intellectuals who nevertheless continue to imagine their relation to the social order as organic on the clerical model” -- literary institutional hierarchies follow clerical model (153)
	•	“It remains to be seen whether the retreat of literary culture to the university was really strategic." (167)

Importance of difficulty
	•	the successful distribution of Standard English (via literature) at lower levels of schooling left no way to distinguish higher levels of schooling: hence the need to revalue difficulty (171)
	•	“One may... say that difficulty itself was positively valued in New Critical practice, that it was a form of cultural capital, just by virtue of imparting to cultural objects a certain kind of rarity, the very difficulty of apprehending them." (168)
	•	“In discovering that literature was intrinsically difficult, these new students also discovered at the same moment why it needed to be studied in the university” (172)
	•	“Literature... presents a united front, in the form of its intrinsic difficulty, against the artifacts of mass culture” (173)

Literature vs mass culture
	•	“Therein lies the peculiar power of mass culture, since the waning cultural centrality of literary works in the face of new mass cultural forms never entailed a denial of the nominally superior value of literature” -- readers of mass media “would no doubt have concede the cultural superiority of literature, whether or not [they] ever felt inclined to read any works so designated" (173)
	•	In 1976 4th ed of Understanding Poetry, Donne's "The Canonization" “is contrasted not with secular, scientific culture, its antagonist in The Well Wrought Urn” but with a popular song from the 1920s (173)
	•	“the mass culture of modernity never coveted the institutional space to which literary culture retreated" -- uni students dutifully studied &amp; accepted the value of literature but “continued to consume both kinds of artifacts in the distinct spheres of their consumption" (174)
	•	“The capacity to experience the social space of the schools and the social space of mass culture as disjunct effectively institutionalized two modes of consumption, one consequence of which was to make literary works more difficult to consume outside the school." (174)
	•	“The effect of New Critical pedagogy was rather to produce a kind of recusant literary culture, at once faithful to the quasi-sacred authority of literature but paying tribute at the same time to the secular authority of a derogated mass culture. For the recusants the artifact of mass culture might be consumed with a certain guilt, or a certain relief; but for those whose allegiance was sworn to secular authority, that culture provided everything there was to consume." (175)

————————
Eliot &gt; Cleanth Brooks as basis for Leavis &amp; New Critics
	•	"we shall have to examine first Eliot's systematic valorization of minor poetry, and then Cleanth Brooks's transformation of that evaluative principle into a technique of interpretation" (141)
	•	Eliot
	⁃	Eliot's valorization of "minor" poets has the same problem of paradox as an embrace of "noncanonical" authors (147)
	⁃	Eliot wants to establish Christianity as a doxa -- “Eliot would like to see ‘Christian faith' as enabling poetic production in general. This conviction is responsible for his tendency to backdate his own religious inclinations, and thus to dispute the reading of /The Waste Land/ in which it stands as a modernist document of ‘disillusion.’” (150)
	⁃	Eliot's fantasy is that literary figures / literary culture can produce the social order / culture at large (152)
	⁃	"Eliot's narrative of English literary history as the story of a split between an orthodox minor tradition and a heterodox major line is thus displaced into allegorical explications of the 'internal structures' of the canonical texts, which all exhibit the features of paradox, irony, or ambiguity formerly attributed specifically to the metaphysicals and the moderns.” (157)
	⁃	“Eliot's critical career, Guillory argues, began with efforts to install a doxa-like orthodoxy that then hardened into “a fantasy of power . . . acted out by Eliot himself when he dictates with unself-conscious pomposity a new (or old) order to society on the basis of his authority as a literary figure. The most profound assumption of that fantasy was always that literary culture is the site at which the most socially important beliefs and attitudes are produced, the site at which beliefs are generated which unify the culture” (152) ” (Gorak 288)
	⁃	
	•	Cleanth Brooks
	⁃	Brooks is defined against philologists. “the emergence of the ‘literary critic' within the generalist faction did not imply a simple repudiation of the disciplinary style of the philologist, but rather the development of a more or less rigorous countermethodology of 'interpretation' which could be put in service of ‘Generalist' aims, the aims of cultural criticism." (155)
	⁃	Well Wrought Urn: “If that text discovers that all canonical literature (or literature per se) speaks the 'language of paradox,’ it still reads paradox as the evidence of a 'unity of experience' no longer available to dissociated moderns, though we moderns may continue to contemplate what we have lost in the experience of the literary artifact." (157)
	⁃	poetry's form as battling science, which is to blame for the dissociativeness of modernity (159)
	⁃	interpretation as also a powerful alternative to science (159)
	⁃	Cleanth Brooks' approach was to look for similarities between "masterpieces" rather than historical differences, and esp similarity between "masterpieces" and metaphysicals and moderns (160)
	⁃	“The revaluation of difficulty on behalf of both metaphysicals and moderns is a consistent objective of /The Well Wrought Urn/" (169)
	⁃	Brooks has to make the established literary curriculum seem difficult, in order to show that all poetry is inherently difficult, in order to show that modernist poetry is justified in being difficult (170)

Compare/contrast Leavis vs New Critics
	•	Leavis's way of valuing a work relied on its heterodoxy: thus institutionalizing it in schools removed the grounds of its critique (140)
	•	New Critics were the opposite -- wanted literature to support orthodoxy that could replace the church, without uni becoming church; treated orthodoxy as something covert to be discovered (140)
	•	Leavis sees judgment as the role of the critics; New Critics see it as interpretation (which works very very hard to find exactly what it wants to find) (141)

            <Text>When we study literature through text mining, our conclusions are not based on an examination of “literature” itself, but on the corpus which is a sample or model of the imagined whole of “literature.” Despite the importance of corpus-building to the interpretation of text mining research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of corpora which re-create social inequalities.
As an eighteenth century scholar, I examine five corpora which are used as the basis of most eighteenth century distant reading: the English Short Title Catalogue database; Eighteenth Century Collections Online; the Eighteenth Century Collections Online  Text Creation Partnership; Project Gutenberg; and HathiTrust. I manually evaluate each corpus’s holdings for a narrow sample of texts, works published in England 1789-99, to investigate and contextualize their representation of female authors. For this eleven-year period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? 
In addition to calculating the gender ratio of authorship for each of the five corpora (including an assessment of the unsigned or unattributable works), I correlate gender with the basic categories of writing present in the corpus, to form more specific conclusions about the role of gender in corpus-building. Simple topic-modelling of the titles of eighteenth century works allows me to identify broad categories such as plays, poetry, pamphlets, novels, songs, sermons, ephemera, and so on. Titles in the eighteenth century are long, and served as advertisements, intentionally created to actively communicate this level of information about their works’ contents: although topic modelling of titles would not be sufficient in other centuries, it is remarkably effective here. Identifying the representation within each corpus of these categories of writing reveals a predictable preference for “literary” forms such as novels and poetry in the smaller corpora.
This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation of smaller corpora. If the novel is the domain of women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by underrepresenting novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of exclusion. Asking bibliographical questions of multiple corpora, in order to learn about the corpora themselves, emphasizes an under-examined stage of text mining research, and provides a basis for other scholars to use these corpora more precisely. Asking pointed questions about gender, in particular, may allow future users of these corpora to address some impacts of historical sexism.</Text>

Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety.

            <Text>E.J. Clery’s The Rise of Supernatural Fiction, 1762-1800 provides an account of what was at stake for the representations of supernatural events in supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news. The “rise” she describes is not an increase in volume and prominence of supernatural stories, since her starting point in 1762 (the Cock Lane ghost) is a major national phenomenon with many imitators. Rather, supernatural fiction ‘rises’ when it acquires cultural legitimacy. Michael Gamer has more recently expanded on how this ‘rise’ fuelled Romanticism’s own rise. In Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation, he details  the interconnectedness of what are now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Gamer argues, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste without risking the loss of cultural capital which attended the Gothic’s “popularity”. Gamer, like Bainbridge and Cronin, primarily examines Wordsworth and the ‘winners’ of the struggle for cultural capital: I, like Clery, am more interested in the ‘losers.’ Accordingly, I attend to much that is not literature, in order to better understand why it is not.</Text>

            <Text>Second experiment: identify genre make-up of databases. (Develop something using topic modelling of titles.) 
“A Romance By Any Other Name: Topic Modelling for an Ontology of 1790s Genres.” Keystone DH. Philadelphia, PA, July 8-10.

When working with large literary databases, scholars naturally wish to know what kind of literature they are working with. A high incidence of religious language in an eighteenth century corpus, for example, will mean something different depending on how many of the documents included in the corpus are sermons. However, the larger and more heterogenous the database, the less likely it is that all of its contents have been thoroughly and consistently identified. Eighteenth century texts predate systems such as the Library of Congress subject headings, so many of the holdings in widely-used resources such as the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) include no metadata regarding their contents’ subject matter. This paper demonstrates the results of a method to assign subject matter designations to all works within these corpora, taking advantage of one of the unique features of eighteenth century literature: long and descriptive titles. Eighteenth century books were advertised and sold without any visual cues as to their contents; they attracted readers through the strength of their title pages alone. Their lengthy titles therefore intentionally communicate their genres, and, as my paper demonstrates, their messages can be distilled through topic modelling. I present my results for the 52,000 titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799, and discuss the resulting ontology of generic categories. As I demonstrate, inferring genres based on how texts describe themselves produces a very different picture of the categories of textual production than the post-facto descriptions that later generations of scholars have produced. I am then able to use these subject categories to compare the contents of several commonly-used digital resources, to identify how representative of eighteenth century literature as a whole each database is. Finally, I discuss how my methods might be adapted to address similar gaps in metadata in related fields.

A discourse: the substance of which was delivered before the Associate Synod, Et At Edinburgh on a Day of Humiliation Observed by them” — which we can infer is a sermon.</Text>

            <Title>Bainbridge</Title>
            <Text>Analysis of poets’ work often doubles as an analysis of their success or failure in the pursuit of cultural capital. For example, Simon Bainbridge, in British Poetry and the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, sees the decade and its poetry through the lens of war. His own interest is in what he terms “the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott” (3). This framework leads Bainbridge to examine Charlotte Smith alongside Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey, and eventually Walter Scott. In his conception of ‘a national bard’ he imagines a particular marriage of poetry’s special status as imaginative literature to a specific poet’s cultivation of a nationally important public persona. Both poetry and the poet are thus pursuing a particular kind of cultural capital that allows them to rise above their own popularity. [“Rise above” = because popularity-with-the-masses is anathema to cultural capital]</Text>

            <Title>distant reading without Moretti</Title>
            <Text>To bring these principles into the field of Digital Humanities by way of an example, I want to offer an alternative geneaology for the practice of distant reading itself. Rachel Buurma and Laura Heffernen provide a valuable history of Josephine Miles as the first ‘distant reader’. Miles’ history, briefly, is as follows:
In the 1930s, as a graduate student at Berkeley, she completed her first distant reading project: an analysis of the adjectives favored by Romantic poets. In the 1940s, with the aid of a Guggenheim, she expanded this work into a large-scale study of the phrasal forms of the poetry of the 1640s, 1740s, and 1840s. In all of this distant reading work, Miles created her tabulations by hand, with pen and graph paper. She also directed possibly the first literary concordance to use machine methods. In the early 1950s, Miles became project director of an abandoned index-card-based Concordance to the Poetical Works of John Dryden. Partnering with the Electrical Engineering department at Berkeley, and contracting with their computer lab and its IBM tabulation machine, Miles used machine methods to complete the concordance. It was published in 1957, six years after she and several woman graduate students and woman punch-card operators began the work. It was thus begun around the time that Busa circulated early proof-of-concept drafts of his concordance to the complete works of St. Thomas Aquinas, and published 17 years before the first volumes of the 56-volume Index Thomasticus began to appear. (Buurma and Heffernan)
Buurma and Heffernan bring Miles’ history to our attention not simply because Miles predates  Roberto Busa, whose Index Thomisticus is often credited as the first large-scale computational literary study. Rather, they emphasize, Miles’ origin story for computational literary study “can stand as an example of how we might write a history of literary scholarship that does not center originality and individual accomplishment” (n. pag.). Unlike Busa, Miles not only gave authorship to the (female) graduate students who carried out much of the labour of creating the concordances, she also thanked and credited the (female) punch card operators who encoded the resulting data. Moreover, when talking of Penny Gee, one of the female staff members of the computer lab, Miles praises her as “‘very smart and good’ and—most importantly—a true collaborator, as opposed to those ‘IBM people from San Jose’ … ‘I’ve never been able to connect with them,’ Miles explains, ‘though I did with Penny Gee. She really taught me’” (n. pag.). Of the positive qualities highlighted here, only one, “smart,” is traditionally valorized among literary critics: to be “good,” a “collaborator,” who can “connect” and “teach” — these qualities are often seen as irrelevant to the singular authority of the figure of the critic, but they are core to a reparative practice. Miles’ work, too, struggled to find appreciation “among literary critics who viewed her datasets as merely preparatory to the true work of evaluation” (n. pag.).</Text>
            <Comments>Ted Underwood’s “Genealogy of Distant Reading” presents a history of distant reading which is not for the most part centrally concerned with computers, and is therefore fundamentally distinct from concepts of “digital humanities” \cite{Underwood:2017uc}. In Underwood’s history, distant reading is “a tradition continuous with earlier forms of macroscopic literary history, distinguished only by an increasingly experimental method, organized by samples and hypotheses that get defined before conclusions are drawn” (Underwood:2017uca p.29}. Underwood “tease[s] out the elided social-scientific genealogy behind distant reading” \cite{Underwood:2017uca p.39} to argue that the term “[d]istant reading was not coined to describe a radically new method. The first occurrence of the phrase, in [Franco Moretti’s] ‘Conjectures on World Literature,’ seems in fact to describe the familiar scholarly activity of aggregating and summarizing previous research” \cite{Underwood:2017uca p.9}[ what is your position on this? You go on to Buurma who does connect distant reading to computation - and you suggest how you will draw on similar ideas about collaboeation etc - but this underwood bit dangles].

Indeed, Buurma notes, “There are good reasons, of course, that scholars and journalists like to begin with Busa: he was the first concordance-maker to automate all five stages of the process, in 1951,” and he intentionally foregrounded and publicized the innovative nature of his work. \cite{Buurma:2018wt}
In the interest of preserving this history of citation, the students were Mary Jackman and Helen S. Agoa, credited on the cover of the published Dryden index. (Miles herself attached her name only to the preface.) From the computer lab staff, Miles particularly thanked Shirley Rice, Odette Carothers, and Penny Gee. </Comments>

            <Title>Special Fields list rationale</Title>
            <Text>Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’</Text>

            <Text>Chapter four uses Ann Radcliffe as an important contrast to Charlotte Smith and especially to Mary Robinson, to challenge the ease with which the number of unique titles can stand in for both “popularity” and “importance.” Taking as my premise that Radcliffe was unquestionably both popular and important in the 1790s, I examine the extent to which she does (or does not) rise to attention within my corpora of that decade. I explore both print runs and reviews as important supplementary forms of information, and prototype and test computational methods to integrate these kinds of information with more accessible metadata. Print runs are of particular importance to interpreting Radcliffe’s career, since a large run of one edition can represent far more actual books produced than several small editions, and Radcliffe’s celebrity often meant large print runs. To compare her output to Smith’s and Robinson’s, I test and compare a few methods of calculating the total number of books printed for each author during the decade. To compare her reception to theirs, I hope to use a prototype version of Megan Peiser’s in-progress Novels Reviewed Database. In both cases, my method will begin with manually researching the three authors’ major works, and then exploring scalable computational methods. The chapter closes, again, with a reflection on Radcliffe as an author.</Text>

            <Text>Bainbridge is not alone is taking Walter Scott as a kind of pinnacle, and looking backwards in search of his antecedents. Richard Cronin, in The Politics of Romantic Poetry, concerns himself with “poetry that speaks to a divided society in an attempt to constitute its readers as citizens of […] ‘the pure commonwealth’” (13). This definition of “political poetry” leads him to Erasmus Darwin as the poet of the the Revolution and the Revolutionary war, William Blake as the poet of the Napoleonic wars, and Richard Southey and Walter Savage Landor as the poets of the post-war period — ending, irresistibly, as so many do, with Walter Scott. His discussion of Scott praises him for [successfully playing the capital-transformation game]: “Scott’s Minstrelsy transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means” (94). The Romantic poets, in both Bainbridge and Cronin’s accounts, support their claims to insight and importance through the inaccessibility of their work in print.</Text>

            <Text>As Chun’s punning title, “Queerying Homophily” suggests, she, like many scholars, turns to queer theory as a way to address the structural failings of algorithms. “Queer DH” is a vibrant field in its own right, with many distinct but interwoven threads. Some work, like Chun’s, take the theoretical underpinnings of contemporary computational practices as their primary object of study, and conceptualize queerer theoretical approaches. Others similarly undertake non-computational research to examine computational subjects queerly, as in Bonnie Ruberg’s Video Games Have Always Been Queer. Many projects apply existing computational methods to queer literatures and histories. Often, these approaches coincide, as queer subjects demand queerer methods, as in T.L. Cowan’s Cabaret Commons. I draw inspiration from work from across this spectrum of queer DH in my pursuit of less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies.</Text>

            <Text>Research the EEBO thread of ESTC/ECCO

The history of the English Short-Title Catalog is long, as befits its enormous scope. “The English Short-Title Catalog (ESTC) is a vast database designed to include a bibliographic record, with holdings, of every surviving copy of letterpress produced in Great Britain or any of its dependencies, in any language, worldwide, from 1473-1800” (CBSR). Today, “The English Short-Title Catalogue is the most comprehensive record of what has appeared in print in Britain and the English-speaking world for all branches of human experience from the last quarter of the fifteenth century to the start of the nineteenth. More specialized studies exist for fields and eras within that span, but no other resource matches ESTC’s dependability over such a broad range” (Vander Meulen 265).
It began as the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue in the 1970s, operating in a similar line as the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476–1640, which first appeared in 1926, and Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641–1700, which appeared in 1951. These catalogues established the ambitious simplicity of the ESTC: to accurately describe every edition of every printed work in English or from the United Kingdom. After the completion of Wing’s STC, “[e]xploratory studies, poorly funded and inadequate though they were” (Korshin 209) throughout the 1950s and 60s pursued the feasibility of systematically accounting for the much larger body of printed work produced in the eighteenth century. The Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue began properly in 1976, at a conference jointly sponsored by the British Library and the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies (Crump 106). Here, “bibliographers and librarians attempted both to arrive at a consensus of the size of the task and the methodology that would have to be adopted to achieve a union catalogue. However, until the works were catalogued, it would not be possible to answer basic questions (such as the potential number of extant items) which would predetermine working methods. The very fact that they found it difficult to agree for want of sound and accepted figures indicated the need for ESTC.” (Crump 105). A pilot project began at the British Library in 1977, under the direction of Robin Alston (Crump 105).
Unlike earlier Short-Title Catalogues, which appeared as lengthly print publication, the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue was conceived as digital from the beginning — a decision which, as Karian notes, “exhibited considerable foresight” (283) in the 1970s. As a result, “ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work” (Karian 283).  Robin Alston and Mervyn Jannetta developed their own cataloguing rules, distinct from the Library of Congress MARC and UK MARC standards (Korshin 211). Once these standards were established, the British Library began to re-catalogue its own holdings, and in 1979 libraries in the United States, Germany, and Australia undertook to supplement them. In these international collaborations, “Where ESTC records already existed, these were adopted as the [new] record and only those works not held in the ESTC base file were catalogued again” (Crump 105). “One implication of the publication history of short-title catalogues is that they have been deemed functional and valuable even before they were complete. (That estimation is crucial, for their full completion is for all practical purposes impossible.) Judging that even a preliminary form of the records was useful to scholars, the planners of ESTC determined to conduct its development ‘in full public view’ and to make the incomplete file available ‘warts and all’ (in the words of Henry Snyder and Michael Crump, responding to criticism by Peter Blayney)” (Vander Meulen 270). Accordingly, the in-progress database “was soon available online, from 1980 via the British Library BLAISE [British LibraryAutomated Information SErvice] system and from 1981 in the US Research Libraries Group RLIN [Research Libraries Information Network] system” (Norman). Each of these databases was worked on locally by researchers, and then updated and reconciled with each other weekly.
To supplement these databases, accessible almost exclusively to librarians with specialized training in operating them and primarily used by the scholars compiling the file, the ESTC intended to publish editions at particular milestones of completeness, intended for the use of non-librarian scholars. Their “first step, a fiche catalogue of [the British Library’s] holdings, together with indexes, generated by the computer” (Crump 105) was published in a microform “snapshot” in 1983, but other milestones did not occur according to schedule. The “joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file ” (Korshin 212) which was expected to follow on microform in 1984 (Korshin 212) did not appear. Alston attributed the delays partly to the immensity of the task, and partly to the impact of short-term cost-cutting decisions, like the reduction of early-stage proofreading or of in-person examination of books, which dramatically increased the labour of verifying the resulting database record. Although he consistently warned “how easily strategic decisions based exclusively on cost usually lead to greater, not less, eventual costs” (Alston), the ESTC each year seemed to be facing a new budget struggle, and important maintenance labour was several times deferred. This created something like a paradox for the ESTC: funding bodies wanted to commit less money to a project which was behind schedule, but the project would remain behind schedule unless it was funded to complete the work required. 
Nonetheless, work continued, and in 1985, the online databases in RLIN and BLAISE were upgraded to allow dynamic updates to a single shared file (Crump 106), which for the first time allowed continuous access to a shared record, rather than the constant exchange and messy merging of individual partially-overlapping records. “Until the file was dynamically available online on RLIN in 1985 batch processing was a weekly nightmare” (Alston). At this time, it was hoped that the new RLIN file would “result in a more complete and coherent ‘first edition’ of ESTC” to be published in 1989 (Crump 106), though this deadline, too, was not met. In the mean time “the ESTC file [was] available to scholars on both BLAISE-LINE and on RLIN.” (Crump 106). To facilitate its use, the ESTC distributed “[a] simplified manual for searching the file on-line” (Crump 106). Crump took the opportunity of the update to rhapsodize on the database’s potential usefulness for other scholars: “No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page” (106). This valuable resource was not without cost. Although the manual on how to formulate search queries was free, use of the ESTC itself was notably not. Institutions or individuals paid to subscribe to the ESTC itself, paid per query for searches to be run, paid per minute for being connected to the database, and often paid for access to the computers they must use in their own libraries. Tabor says “the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing” (367).
“In 1987, with the agreement of the Bibliographical Society and the Modern Language Association of America, the International Committee approved the extension of the database to cover the period from the beginning of printing in the British Isles (ca. 1472) to 1700. The file changed its name to the 'English Short Title Catalogue', thereby keeping its well-known acronym. The USA team began cataloguing pre-1701 material in 1989, joined in the mid-1990s by the British Library team, and the resulting records were made available in the RLIN file from 1994.” (Norman). “In 1992, IESTC approved a further extension of the file to include serial publications. The USA team began work in 1994 on the cataloguing of serials within the scope of ESTC” (Norman). 
Concurrently with the development of the ESTC, Wing’s seventeenth-century STC was undergoing redevelopment into a second edition, overseen by Katharine Pantzer. The second edition of Wing’s STC was published in two volumes in 1976 and 1986, followed by a set of exhaustive indexes in 1991. This second edition “represented a vast development of the original” (Vander Meulen 268), incorporating thousands of new entries, expanding the titles, and adding explanatory notes and headnotes. Its completion in 1991 also marked the end of the ability of its publisher and sponsor, the Bibliographical Society, to support it (Vander Meulen 269). “Accordingly, in 1999 the Society made an agreement with ESTC whereby the latter… would assume official responsibility for receiving new STC data” (Vander Meulen 270). The ESTC continued to research new entries and improve existing ones, releasing a second edition of the file on CD-ROM in 1998 and a third edition in 2003 (Norman).
In 2006, almost thirty years after the commencement of the project, the ESTC underwent another major shift: the database was made publicly available to be searched for free online. This inspired more rhapsodizing, this time from Tabor: “The freeing of ESTC … now places in one location, for the consultation of anyone with internet access, the fullest and most up-to-date bibliographical account of ‘English’ printing” (367). At the same time, the ESTC began a project “to provide full title and imprint transcriptions for the eighteenth-century records” (Tabor 370). Vander Meulen says that “The history of ESTC is in fact the record of steady developments. Some have been conspicuous—for instance, the physical progression from a printed prototype to microfiche, CD, online access via the vendors Blaise Line and RLIN, and universal online availability through the British Library.” (Vander Meulen 270) Many more have been less visible, in constant improvements to the accuracy and detail of the records. In 2011, the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research at the University of California Riverside was awarded a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to “redesign the ESTC as a 21st century research tool” (“Planning Grant”), which was followed in 2013 by a larger two-year grant to execute software improvements to the ESTC.</Text>

            <Title>conclusion</Title>
            <Text>As this brief survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no ‘perfect’ corpus for large-scale study of eighteenth-century texts.  Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. As this dissertation will argue, these questions of digital history have important resonance with literary questions about literary canon formation.</Text>

            <Text>You might also like to look at D. F. McKenzie's two chapters on the London book trade in single years, 1644 and 1668, in his posthumous Making Meaning collection. This is analogue-era scholarship, and concerning a period other than yours, but I think very relevant for some of your groundwork issues. On publishing statistics, DFM is very incisive about the difference between production rates and survival rates, and the tendency of scholars to talk about the first when really the only thing they see is the second. This isn't going to be such a big issue for the 1790s, but it's going to be an issue all the same. He's good on sheet counts and print runs too: the way a fugitive one-sheet broadside in two tiny editions can show up bibliometrically (in an ESTC count, say) as a bigger deal than, or more "popular" than, a fat heavyweight folio in a single edition with a big print run. </Text>

(For one of many, many examples in this book, see Liu's brilliant discussion of "atmosphere" in landscape painting and poetry from essentially the Middle Ages to Wordsworth in his chapter on Wordsworth and the picturesque--in a few brief pages, one gets an incredibly helpful art history account that also illuminates Wordsworth's poetry)</Text>

            <Title>reparative &gt; timeliness transition</Title>
            <Text>The goal of this serious thinking, for Felski, is to remind us “that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized” — a discovery which will “shock” us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite to understant that future ways of life will also be organized differently. For Sedgwick, too, the possibility of “surprise” in a non-paranoid reading, the idea that even the most predictable past events could have unfolded differently, is crucial for imagining change in the future. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing aftershocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that “our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices” are not universal and invulnerable. Robert Miles is one of many to describe the impact of the French Revolution as centred less on individual events, and more on the alarming “historical rupture” which the revolution was seen to constitute. For many, this rupture represented an opportunity for optimism — but many more experienced the turmoil as near-apocalyptic, and even for optimists the sense of impending change was often uncomfortable. Miles argues that a widespread sense of profound change shaped far more than just political thought: “The sense of crisis … linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.” One way that these works were shaped by their context is a heightened sense of timeliness for published works.</Text>

            <Text>Drawing together three scholarly conversations with three distinct histories — the digital humanities, the literary canons of 1790s, and reparative reading — it is difficult to attentively delineate the links and the tensions between each thread. Especially since many of these fields have, in fact, overlapped substantially, there is a danger of simplistically conflating distinct lines of thoughts. At the same time, over-emphasis on distinctions can overstate the separations between fields which do in fact (as the existence of this dissertation contents) share important affinities. To navigate these conceptual overlaps carefully, let us make our way through each area of an imagined Venn diagram of the three. We can discuss each pair in turn — DH and eighteenth century studies; eighteenth century studies and queer theory; queer theory and DH — to make our way toward the centre where all three overlap.</Text>

            <Title>ch 5 - Gothic</Title>
            <Text>My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being “unserious” (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about “redeeming literary value” in the Gothic.</Text>

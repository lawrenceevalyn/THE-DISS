            <Text>The Digital Humanities
Timeliness and feeling, as investigated through bibliographical research and reparative reading, thus chart a tangled network of interrelated concepts. Reparative reading requires an openess to the multiplicity of meaning which works may accrue as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and adapated in response to the pressures of timeliness. Precise bibliographical research can recapture and contextualize the complex and variable strategies of feeling that competed throughout the period. Not yet integrated into this set of priorities and methodological frameworks is the element of my project which often requires the most justification: my use of quantitative and computational methodologies.</Text>

            <Title>morally good ways of reading?</Title>
            <Text>(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of all literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone else’s job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong. So it must be the ways of reading, not the things read, which it is our responsibility to suss out...)

            <Title>ch 2 - fame and legacy</Title>
            <Text>Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived “seriousness” of their reputations. Influenced by Ashley J. Cross’s “From Lyrical Ballads to Lyrical Tales: Mary Robinson's Reputation and the Problem of Literary Debt,” I am interested in exploring the careers of Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as my “case study” for this chapter. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for “popularity,” “celebrity,” and “legacy” which are both fruitful and nuanced. In addition to reading the extensive literature grappling with these concerns for individual authors, I am currently thinking of ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. I may also add scholarly uptake (perhaps through the proxy of  JSTOR articles, since JSTOR makes their archive accessible for experiments of this type) as a particular sub-type of “legacy.”</Text>

            <Title>model 3: reading</Title>
            <Text>Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.</Text>

            <Title>women have leisure in convents</Title>
            <Text>“I came to learn that women have never had a history or culture of leisure. (Unless you were a nun, one researcher later told me.) That from the dawn of humanity, high status men, removed from the drudge work of life, have enjoyed long, uninterrupted hours of leisure. And in that time, they created art, philosophy, literature, they made scientific discoveries and sank into what psychologists call the peak human experience of flow. Women aren’t expected to flow. I read feminist leisure research (who knew such a thing existed?) and international studies that found women around the globe felt that they didn’t deserve leisure time. It felt too selfish. Instead, they felt they had to earn time to themselves by getting to the end of a very long To Do list. Which, let’s face it, never ends. I began to realise that time is power. That time is a feminist issue.”

            <Text>Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published?

Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)</Text>

            <Title>ch 4 - chapbook sales</Title>
            <Text>My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see how much we do know about the chapbook trade. I am particularly interested in the cycle of responses between pamphlets, and whether there are geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness. This chapter will of course address Hannah More’s Cheap Repository Tracts, but I am equally curious about the works among which hers were sold. My “case study” could trace the printing and circulation of one of More’s pamphlets and a few of its fellow-travellers, as the foundation for a discussion of More’s hybrid literary forms. </Text>

            <Title>debt vs credit</Title>
            <Text>It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit
It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing to promise repayment) and then 80% of the time we’re told that he did follow up and repay
Are the screeds against debt in the same works...? I’ll have to check, but I THINK there’s a distinction being made between “credit” (which is tied to social credibility) and “debt” (which is seen as impersonal and with near-mystical properties)
Similarly peasants can live like 5 years in a cottage without paying rent and they’ll get around to it when the landlord asks them, and this too is not “debt”, in fact at the start of the century it’s a narrative marker of cruelty for the landlord to insist on the rent being paid
Ok, those are my thoughts on credit vs debt as part of the shift from parochial economies to imperial market capitalism</Text>

            <Text>This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.</Text>

This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.</Text>

            <Title>Sedgwick</Title>
            <Text>Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: “The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one’s findings: “What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.” The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. </Text>

            <Title>Frow, John. Genre</Title>
            <Text>Frow, John. Genre. New York: Routledge, 2015. Print.
John Frow articulates genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.</Text>

In Bannet’s book the importance of the French Revolution itself is actually minimised, when compared, that is, with the behavioural and attitudinal changes slowly fomented by British women writers across the eighteenth century. But, Bannet argues, the British reactions to the French Revolution nevertheless remain crucial in shaping and re-shaping ideas of domesticity.

            <Text>My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.</Text>

            <Text>All my terms (seriousness, timelessness, etc) are reasons a work might be canonized — clarifies my interests by ‘zooming out’ to the framework of the canon
What is the print landscape of the 1790s actually like? As opposed to our filtered versions via academics, subsequent generations of writers
TL Cowan etc - how do you actually do recuperative/reparative work on archives
Looking at digital corpora the way that people look at anthologies, classroom teaching, etc; talk about why it’s important to know this, becase this is what we all refer to now
Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)
Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. (But stay away from seeing Romanticism as starting here; I’d have to do a lot of work to justify to scholars the beginning of Romanticism in the 1790s)
Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about celebrity and reprinting into this chapter)
Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft &amp; Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strageically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?
A lot of my questions aren’t quite about canons, they’re about ARCHIVES, which are related but without the idea of cultural capital; do our archives just reflect our canons? — Marisett - how the dewey decimal system systematically excludes african american authors of the 20thC — data production (of course it’s really all capta — the things you choose, and also the things that are made available for capture; shaped by choices and by constraints)
Is it even possible to get back to that initial moment before the archive formation began? I’m going to try! Undoing the misperception of what we begin with “before” the archive, and the perception of what is produced by DH

Who was actually printing what? Booksellers and print culture from a DH angle

Gothic: synthesize popular and political? Radical novels are often Gothic; but Gothic is also highly popular/mainstream. Not just a simple fusion of mass and racial media, but something there? Gothic as a mode or material that people want to have an inherent political content, but in fact it can be used for any agenda, it can be used for various forms… but there’s a lot that can’t be reshaped? Repackages radical themes to be mass accessible (melodrama?)? — Re-read Gary Kelley’s Jacobin Novel; something on melodrama

TITLE:  (1790s English) Print Politics in the Digital Archive

Map of the thesis at this stage:
	1.	Introduction: archive formation!
	2.	Comparison of digital corpora (write this first)
	3.	Ok, now how can I use these corpora to ask again what the print landscape of the 1790s actually looked like?
	⁃	Mainstream press?
	⁃	Radical press? Is it actually surreptitious/marginal?
[Something something the Gothic? (Will develop as the earlier parts develop) — but don’t put this in the proposal set]
TODO: Slot all the bits that I don’t want to lose into this new structure

Ongoing warning: I’m not trying to talk to undergrads, so I don’t need to debunk undergrad misperceptions. Read more secondary literature. Email Terry for books more often!

Mention that I am writing my own code, and that I think it’s crucial to read code and critique its algorithmic assumptions. Very explicit about methods. 2015 NSF report on reproducibility of research. My methods have to be able to explain how they are trustworthy.
(Put datasets in open access — T-space? Cultural Analytics?)
(Can generate a lot of words on methods section — but don’t bury in appendices? Instead put it in methods sections? 10,000 words, not 40,000 words. Remember that Terry is the audience.)

To read: Alan Liu — read his work on Romantic canonization; try to meet him? Him and the editors of Romantic Circles are the godfathers of DH and Romanticism. Just had one in PMLA about disjunction between DH and literary critics, how we frame questions and results
Stephen Berhrendt? Editor of Romantic Circles?

            <Text>My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. The “major” works across the period develop from sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. I want to pose the same questions as the authors themselves: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor one’s feelings without being misled by them? In pursuit of this answer, my reading has led me to a subject matter, a methodology, and an affective stance.
I remain committed, for my subject matter, to the 1790s as an incredibly dense period of complex literary production shaped by what Robert Miles identifies as an apocalyptic political rupture.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change. For example, there is a narrative about a naive emotional philosophy in sentimental novels (benevolence), which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature. Perhaps, at its broadest level, this narrative is true or useful, but there are many more ways in which it is false.
One way which I seek to be more accurate is by paying close attention to what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. So, for example, I am interested in Burke’s Reflections as a text which is outcompeted by Williams when it is first published, and attracts a flood of negative responses, but which slowly outcompetes the others and becomes more successful over time as it gains credit for its prescience.
As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one.
My interest in the gothic is thus subsumed within my interest in 18thC strategies of feeling generally; gothic fear and supernatural imagination both represent strategies which are in conversation (and competition) with other strategies, which I also want to integrate.

            <Title>"good" and "bad" texts</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

            <Text>Conspiracy theories play such a huge role in France! The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!
Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

            <Text>“The first [group of ‘misfits’] was excluded from literary history in order to secure the status of those writers who did ‘fit’ (the ‘Romantics’) even as the Romantics themselves based their claim to high literary status on their status as misfits-- on their success in transcending the literary marketplace to which other writers were represented as in thrall (because fitting too well).” (5)

“there are recurring themes, such as the manner in which the ‘structural transformation of the public sphere’ during the Romantic era is itself an integral aspect of the story of how ‘high’ literature was constructed at the expense of the ‘low’ (where ‘public engagement’ becomes a defining feature of the ‘low’, and self-cultivation a quality of ‘high’).” (6) — nowadays we value public engagement; at the time, politics/ethics was publicly engaged…?

	•	“As I see the literary culture of the period, there is a dialectical play between the radical Enlightenment and its counter. But instead of seeing the period Balkanized into three generations, with the first and last favoring ‘enlightenment modes’ and the middle settling into ‘reaction’ (or ‘Counter-Enlightenment’), I detect a constant dialectical play between these two poles that were subjectivities as much as they were political positions and, as a consequence, also stubbornly resistant to rational argument. This dialectical play is driven less by the French Revolution and more by the historical rupture it was seen to constitute. … The sense of crisis induced by the first intimation of ‘global synchronicity’, linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later, and they differ dialectically.” (11)

I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.</Text>

Mostly, I think, spreading all these poems out in my timeline helps to clarify that Elegiac Sonnets (like Tristram Shandy!) is not actually a single unified work representing one moment of time, but rather an assemblage that can react to the events it shapes. The re-introduction of chronological gaps makes it easier to identify where she is developing her thoughts or changing her mind, and highlights the trial-and-error of her experiments as sets of poems are entered into the record.</Text>

            <Text>A particularly interesting text which might reward a study of both its timeliness and its use of feeling is Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, which was first published in 1766 but continued to be frequently reprinted in the 1790s. The persistence of Wakefield immediately undermines any literary history which wholly relegates the sentimental novel to the 1760s and 1770s. However, by the 1790s Wakefield is no longer competing with The Man of Feeling (which many of its former dedicated readers now regarded with embarassment), and instead was read alongside the contemporary literature of sensibility in the Gothic mode. There is much still to be uncovered about how readers in the 1790s made very different sense of this work’s political and religious sermons, dramatic and moving prison scenes, and moralizing love-plot.</Text>

            <Text>The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 
I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.</Text>

            <Title>OGS Plan of Study</Title>
            <Text>A recent article by Bode exemplifies a current shift in approaches to digitally-enhanced literary scholarship. Bode builds a critique of “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as complete and objective, Bode argues, it is not different from New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.

I have narrowed my scope to an eleven-year “decade,” keyed to the French Revolution, to make my inquiry feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 works published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.

To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading and corpus stylistics, but I will marry these to bibliographic textual studies and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired bibliographic records for 51,965 works listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewhere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, enabling more detailed computational exploration of their subject matter. 

I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically and influentially during the 1790s, but are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon.

The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and will recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.</Text>

            <Title>McCarty: interdisciplinary</Title>
            <Text>Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that “[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation”: the current state of “digital humanities” research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to “hard sciences.” The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables — an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti — is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,” it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy — a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.
What do you think?
(via fanhackers)
“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!
I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.
Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

            <Title>18thC feeling</Title>
            <Text>Reading Feeling
My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional response, is this a healthy form of exercise for its audience’s moral feeling, or a weakening distraction from real moral action? These questions, in translated form, continue to shape my own questions about literature as a field: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor the importance of feeling without being misled by emotional manipulation?
The “major” works across the period are characterized by sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. My interest in the gothic and the supernatural is thus subsumed within a larger conversation about the representation of feeling. As Clery, Miles, and Gamer have explored in different ways, gothic and supernatural stories encompass a subset of literary strategies to understand and use feeling, which exist in conversation and competition with other strategies. Each work must strike its own balance between exciting the feelings of its readers, and moderating them. The simplest narrative tracing this development begins with a naive emotional philosophy of benevolence in sentimental novels, which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature.</Text>

            <Title>research methods for corpora comparisons</Title>
            <Text>My biggest-scale question is: I have all of these different corpora of stuff from 1789-99. How can I compare what they contain? If people only worked with the absolute easiest corpus to access (ECCO-TCP), what would they be leaving out?

I want to develop a consistent ontology (in the computer science definition of the word) to apply to all of the corpora, so I can directly compare what kinds of materials each includes. It's important for this ontology to be able to tell me things like "this corpus consists entirely of plays" (because one of them definitely does) but I don't know how to know in advance what categories I'll need. (I'm going to ask my mom about this, ontologies are her jam.)

Then I want to look at each individual corpus and classify its contents into my ontology categories. I'll probably do this computationally also, but it's important to me to classify at least some of each corpus by hand, to check (or train?) my computational approach. Since I can't classify 52,000 things by hand (1 minute per thing = 866 hours) I want to take a random sample, classify *that*, and say "the whole thing probably looks roughly like this." I'll probably be classifying just by title / title page so they should all be able to "respond," but if I want to look at how well those titles reflect the actual content I might start bumping up against works that I can't access (and also I'll want to use smaller samples so I can spend longer on each item.)

I'd like to use the smallest sample that is still acceptably trustworthy. I don't know what is considered acceptably trustworthy: 70%? 98%?

I have several corpora -- smallest one 466 items, biggest one 52,000 -- so I am looking for a calculation to run each time I decide to sample a new corpus. (My first instinct was to pick one number and sample that many of each one, but on reflection, that's... not right, is it? Should I sample the same *percentage* of each one?)

I'm basically treating each corpus as a non-random sample of the platonic ideal of "Printed Works In Britain 1789-99" and trying to see how each corpus represents that platonic ideal, and also trying to inch closer to that platonic ideal.</Text>

            <Text>My introduction will define the terms and concepts which the rest of the dissertation will use, paying particular attention to the parallel development of similar concerns in DH and non-DH fields. I will explicitly note that my DH methods align me with scholars in queer DH, and discuss some of the underlying assumptions of queer theory which shape my thinking: my aspiration is a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. The introduction will also address why I define my window of interest as 1789-99, and who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.
Vocabulary to be discussed:
	•	“Surface” reading vs “distant” reading (and, of course, their ties to close reading)
	•	Popularity, canon, marginalization
	•	My preferred DH terminology around modelling, sensitivity, and fruitfulness
The introduction will thus allow me to to deal directly with the way that other researchers in my fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address my questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading.

            <Text>My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair’s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer’s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the “parade of authors” and “parliament of texts” models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the “footprint” left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski’s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “resonance,” which takes Brewer’s “footprint” as the primary object of study to trace the “busy afterlife of the literary artifact” which “refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.” This “busy afterlife” can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work’s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. </Text>

            <Title>ch 5 - Gothic</Title>
            <Text>My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being “unserious” (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about “redeeming literary value” in the Gothic.</Text>

            <Text>Characteristics of a High Quality Thesis 
	•	The title clearly reflects the focus and the argument. 
	•	A significant and substantial problem has been selected for investigation. 
	•	There is an early statement of the project aims. 
	•	The project presents a considerable advance on existing knowledge. 
	•	The thesis demonstrates a systematic pursuit of a consistent line of inquiry. 
	•	It is well-planned and executed, with each section clearly building on the last (that is, there is a coherent and unifying macro-level structure). 
	•	There is clear signposting and linking between paragraphs, sections, and chapters. It consistently (but not repetitively) reminds the reader of the purpose, argument, or overall thrust of the thesis. 
	•	The literature review is critical and evaluative, and sets forth an argument for why and how the study should be conducted. 
	•	The discussion of the rationale for selecting a methodology and method (including up-to-date methodological literature) is balanced. The ground-setting is sophisticated and appropriate (including exposition of underlying assumptions, and relevance to the research aim). 
	•	The research design is appropriate and allows the questions to be answered. 
	•	There is a meticulous account of the procedure. 
	•	A rich variety of evidence is employed to develop a balanced argument. 
	•	Advanced analytical skills are used to demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem; a clear chain of evidence is laid down. 
	•	The discussion is disciplined and not excessively speculative. 
	•	Conclusions are well drawn and convincing (they relate the outcomes back to the research aims); clear and strong knowledge claims are made about the exact contributions of the thesis. 
	•	Key concepts or variables are clearly defined and consistently used throughout. 
	•	Written expression is elegant, precise, and economical. 
	•	There is evidence of systematic proofreading and error correction. </Text>

            <Title>ch 3 - lingering legacies</Title>
            <Text>Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? As in my first chapter, the “case study” texts for this chapter will emerge from my broader research. I am particularly eager to investigate timely re-stagings of plays, given the heightened ephemerality and thus timeliness of theatrical productions compared to print; my first step is to assemble a precise timeline of what was staged during the period. For printed works, some initial exploration suggests that Shakespeare, Oliver Goldsmith, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Johnson, or Milton might be of interest. I will need to determine what distinction, if any, I might want to draw between “canonical” authors like Shakespeare and Milton, whose posthumous prominence is predictable, and any shorter-lived targeted reprintings that I might discover. This chapter, then, is another way of engaging with the idea of “legacy,” exploring the distinctions between “timelessness” and “lasting timeliness.”</Text>

            <Title>long history of using songs to be popular</Title>
            <Text>I've been thinking a lot about songs. As far as I can tell, in the 1820s, poets have been boldly revitalizing poetry by publishing edited versions of popular songs for at least fifty years.

The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects. But, seeing Wordsworth and Coleridge as participants in a literary conversation also makes them more interesting again, so I can forgive them their propaganda and just focus on how interesting it is that Wordsworth's 1798 "The Thorn" has so much in common with Hannah More's 1796 "Ballad of Robert and Richard" (both of them are trying to 'elevate' ghost stories above vulgar superstition, for the improvement of their audiences, but with completely different ideas as to what that entails).

The second part of "thinking a lot about songs" involves a leap of several hundred years: Jo Walton is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning writer, and she says that "the single most quoted thing I have ever written" is... a limerick she posted in a usenet newsgroup in 1998, "The Lurkers Support Me In Email," to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean.” I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find that Hannah More has also written a morally-improving ballad to that tune (or, if she hasn't, it's only because the song is too associated with Jacobins), and certainly her other songs all mention specific tunes which she assumes I will already know.

So there's something interesting to me, here, about the idea of layering your words over top of pattern someone else already knows, as a way to get your version to stick more easily in people's heads. I don't think Jo Walton was intentionally trying to write something extremely memorable, but Hannah More certainly was.</Text>

            <Text>(1a) I am excited about the ways that distant reading allows the consideration of more works, and thus an expansion of the works under discussion.  I’ll probably make a database trying to combine all the stuff I have, and definitely make a lot of artisanal hand-crafted “small data.
(1b) I am also excited about the recursive reflective process of modelling: the usefulness of making one’s models and their parameters explicit and testing multiple models; the need to actually meaningfully *account for* the full variety of what one is working with, to grapple with and reconcile outliers.”
My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline.
Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all” (McCarty). These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.
“The range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation.” … “Between these two is what seems to me the ideal – a combination, not compromise, of centrifugal freedom and centripetal beholdenness.” (McCarty) 
“digital humanities offers a middle ground or conjectural space within which, data being simply data, the objects of study dear to the humanities may be treated temporarily as if they were objects of nature, like rocks or stars, then the results of that treatment juxtaposed to how we see them and questions asked.” (McCarty)</Text>

            <Text>My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.
I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” </Text>

O’Quinn discusses three particular performances of Joseph Addison’s Cato (1713) and a famous 1812 portrait of John Philip Kemble in the role of Cato, in order to compare each production’s allegory of George III’s political position and to make a broader argument about the use of partially forgetting the past when re-staging history.

            <Text>Reading Feeling, Writing Timeliness:
Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature
To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two contentious elements of literature, the complex and variable interrelationship of which my study foregrounds, are feeling and timeliness. Both concepts shape eighteenth century writing, and my approach to it. “Feeling” as a central idea refers both to the literature of sensibility as an evolving counterpoint to enlightenment rationalism, and to contemporary processes of reparative reading which foreground the limits of scholarly critique. “Timeliness” encompasses both the urgent responses of the eighteenth century mediascape to a perceived historical rupture, and to an exhaustively particular methodology of historicized textual study. Although my project remains quantitative and computational in its technological foundations, my central interest remains with the field of eighteenth century studies, rather than the field of the digital humanities.</Text>

(What about, e.g., Percy editing Frankenstein? Other manuscript works were surely revised in response to feedback, but Mary giving Percy a copy doesn’t feel like “publication”.)
Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren’t likely to be fully useful. I like first publication to reflect when the work became less inchoate and entered into a broader literary conversation — this is the point at which chronological connections seem most likely to be informative.</Text>

            <Text>On the Grasshopper and Cricket

The poetry of earth is never dead:
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead
In summer luxury,--he has never done
With his delights; for when tired out with fun
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
On a lone winter evening, when the frost
Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

The above sonnet was written in competition with Leigh Hunt.

            <Text>What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.
I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.</Text>

Memoralizing, too, is cyclical: “And now, where Caesar saw with proud disdain / The wattled hut and skin of azure stain, / Corinthian columns rear their graceful forms, / And light varandas brave the wintry storms, / While British tongues the fading fame prolong / Of Tully's eloquence and Maro's song.”

Perhaps, she says, long ages past away, 
And set in western waves our closing day, {120} 
Night, Gothic night, again may shade the plains 
Where Power is seated, and where Science reigns; 
England, the seat of arts, be only known 
By the gray ruin and the mouldering stone; 
That Time may tear the garland from her brow, {125} 
And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now. 
   Yet then the ingenuous youth whom Fancy fires 
With pictured glories of illustrious sires, 
With duteous zeal their pilgrimage shall take 
From the blue mountains, or Ontario's lake, {130} 
With fond adoring steps to press the sod 
By statesmen, sages, poets, heroes trod

…

  But who their mingled feelings shall pursue 
When London's faded glories rise to view?

In floods of people poured itself abroad; {160} 
Ungirt by walls, irregularly great, 
No jealous drawbridge, and no closing gate; 
Whose merchants (such the state which commerce brings) 
Sent forth their mandates to dependant kings; 
Streets, where the turban'd Moslem, bearded Jew, {165} 
And woolly Afric, met the brown Hindu; 
Where through each vein spontaneous plenty flowed, 
Where Wealth enjoyed, and Charity bestowed. 
Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet 
Each splendid square, and still, untrodden street; {170} 
Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time, 
The broken stair with perilous step shall climb, 
Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round, 
By scattered hamlets trace its antient bound, 
And, choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey {175} 
Through reeds and sedge pursue his idle way. 
  With throbbing bosoms shall the wanderers tread 
The hallowed mansions of the silent dead, 
Shall enter the long isle and vaulted dome 
Where Genius and where Valour find a home; {180} 
Awe-struck, midst chill sepulchral marbles breathe, 
Where all above is still, as all beneath; 
Bend at each antique shrine, and frequent turn 
To clasp with fond delight some sculptured urn, 
The ponderous mass of Johnson's form to greet, {185} 
Or breathe the prayer at Howard's sainted feet. 

…

Oft shall the strangers turn their eager feet {205} 
The rich remains of antient art to greet, 
The pictured walls with critic eye explore, 
And Reynolds be what Raphael was before. 
On spoils from every clime their eyes shall gaze, 
Egyptian granites and the Etruscan vase; {210} 
And when midst fallen London, they survey 
The stone where Alexander's ashes lay, 
Shall own with humbled pride the lesson just 
By Time's slow finger written in the dust. </Text>

            <Text>Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices. Its extended discussion (and, at points, critique) of the practice of critique highlights similarities between conversations about reading in the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries. For example, when Felski hyperbolically lists the “unserious” reading practices which are presumed to be the only alternative to critique, “naive reading, sentimental effusion, impressionistic judgment, fuzzy-headed amateurism, and mere ‘chatter about Shelley’,” sentimentality is explicitly named alongside forms of ‘sloppy’ thinking that are presumed to be incompatible with rationality. The need to maintain rationality in the face of emotion takes on moral implications in Felski’s hyperbole as well: without critique, the question goes, “what will save us from perdition, what will keep us from committing all those sins we’ve been warned against,” what will keep us from being dangerously bad readers? Of course, part of Felski’s conclusion is that these forms of “bad reading” are not, despite their emotional contamination, morally wrong or intellectual vacuous — but like Sedgwick, she sketches her alternative lightly.</Text>

            <Text>In its broadest strokes, this narrative is probably mostly true, and can certainly be useful. Nonetheless, I wish to complicate it by seeking to reconcile “major” works with their “minor” peers, and by foregrounding what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. My interest in noncanonical works stems from a desire to recognize the real variety of responses expressed throughout the period in question. Even when one literary affective mode is at its peak popularity, other opinions are being expressed and other tools are being employed. [Just because an idea doesn’t “win” its year doesn’t make it uninteresting; rather, the opposite.] Moreover, individual authors evolve in opinion over time, and even individuals works change in meaning over time, hence my interest in timeliness.</Text>

Author is of course an important component! But it can also promote the false idea that changes within an author’s body of work are mostly due to personal matters or artistic evolution, rather than being responses to other works being produced or to changes in the world at large. </Text>

            <Title>ch 1 - what's not novels?</Title>
            <Text>Chapter one takes up the eternal problem of archival gaps, and asks how we might interrogate or fill these gaps with computational methods. It asks how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s. It begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to fascimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disaparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.
Current materials acquired include:
	•	51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue
	•	42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online
	•	10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online
	•	4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library
	•	466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership
Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).
The first chapter thus introduces my decade of interest and the materials and perspectives I bring to bear on it, laying the foundation for my future questions about literary popularity and literary legacy.</Text>

Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts. Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.</Text>

Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]
Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)
My project filling the gap: Hannah More!
Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.
[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

            <Title>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study</Title>
            <Text>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history":
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."
It requires research and study, in order to identify and disentangle the many projects and effects within a work; we must know which parts to discard and which to nurture, to render something useful to ourselves, and we must know what exists for us to repurpose: this is why I study literature. And it requires instruction in order to allow students to get past, e.g., "I thought I was supposed to respect Mrs Bennet" to the literary riches within: this is why I teach literature.
(Literature, unlike history, is permitted artistic license.)
This constant re-translation allows us to continue conferring and experiencing value to the work of previous generations. I don't value the past or tradition simplistically, or for the virtue of merely being older; but we do not always have to reinvent the wheel, and seeing that things were different in the past can allow us to remember that they will be different in the future.
(Though I suppose, since I proceed on the assumption that it is not possible to perceive or understand the "now," I do often dismiss the contemporary as insufficiently informative to be getting on with.)</Text>

            <Title>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British</Title>
            <Text>Nicola J. Watson’s Revolution and the Form of the British Novel (1994) also investigates the associations between fictional form and politics. For Watson, novelists on both sides of the Revolution debate realised that there was a clear connection between some major themes of the novel and the political debates of the 1790s. The sentimental novel’s depiction of a heroine choosing her own lover in defiance of parental authority,for example,might correlate with disobedience towards political authority,just as an attempted seduction of a heroine could stand for the attempts of insurgents to tempt unwary Britons into sedition. Watson argues that both conservative and radical novelists tried to exploit these metaphorical connections, making the majority of 1790s novels much more political that they might at first appear. Even the very form of the novel,Watson contends, was a political statement in itself. Epistolary novels, for instance, were inherently political because the letter was a deeply suspect article in the 1790s, standing for secret communi- cation between people and connected with espionage, with the evidence used in treason trials and with the radical ‘corresponding societies’ (established in Britain to communicate directly with the Revolutionaries in France). </Text>

Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.
When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.

            <Text>I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.
I’m interested in strategies of feeling as an ethical concern which lives on today with discussions of reparative reading, and I’m interested in textual timeliness as subject matter that can shed light on the individuality of text’s strategies of feelings through bibliographical and computational research.
My thinking has led me to a methodology, a subject matter, and a philosophical/emotional stance.
The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change.</Text>

            <Title>Wordsworth &amp; More</Title>
            <Text>let’s see, looking though my notes — looks like William Wordsworth writes a ton of poems that are just incredibly pretentious versions of Hannah More’s stories/ballads
Alex: “has that been said before. god I hate wordsworth
such a mansplainer
so that would be a great topic”
Michael Gamer has said, essentially, that Wordsworth is writing more pretentious versions of popular ghost stories
Alex: “proving that he is one of those dudes in a meeting who repeats what the woman said but louder
but no one Hannah More especially?”
no, Hannah More hates ghost stories for the same reason Wordsworth does — they are vulgar and unchristian
but she uses them anyway, the same way wordsworth does
to subvert them into morally improving tales
or, well, WW is less clear w/ moral improvement of individual poems
but Gamer makes a compelling argument re: his overall claim to have “elevated” his material
Alex: “is there room to argue against Gamer, or to move it in another direction then?”
I don’t know that More is a specific source for Wordsworth; it’s not impossible, but also not immediately likely to me. What interests me is the similarity of their rhetorical stance toward their material and their shared mission of “elevating” for moral improvement, contrasted with their success — Wordsworth has got everybody buying his propaganda, More not so much
Alex: “well, he is a dude.......
but I see the question, and how it relates to the question about 1790s you have formulated...
certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business.”
hmmm.. Gamer is mostly making a broader argument about the Gothic as the immediate source for Romanticism, whereas More is essentially orthogonal to Romanticism…
(I agree with &amp; really like Gamer’s argument about the Gothic &amp; Romanticism)
More want to repurpose and “elevate” the Gothic for essentially evangelical Christian ends — it is astonishing how much I like her, really, given that she is the perfect precursor to all those meddling Victorian moralist middle-class ladies
Alex: “right, but you are still seeing something new there, about More, that both fits in with an is distinct from Gamer - and is core to your questions about your period”
yeah, I think I would use Gamer as a leaping-off point to pursue this slightly separate track, about other attempts to elevate/repurpose popular writing
Alex: “sounds chapter-able. very good.”</Text>

            <Title>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems</Title>
            <Text>Marjorie Levinson’s Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems (1986). Writing broadly in the tradition of Marxist criticism Levinson theorised interestingly about the relationship between history and literature in her Rethinking Historicism (1989), but it was her new readings of ostensibly unpolitical poems such as the ‘Intimations of Immortality’ ode and ‘Tintern Abbey’ in the earlier book which have had the most lasting effect. For her, political events were vital in shaping Wordsworth’s verse, even when they were apparently absent. His choice of images could reveal the link Levinson argued. An apparently innocuous reference to a solitary ‘tree’, for example, might allude to the French tree of liberty, or his ‘single field’ to the Champ de Mars. But it was the omissions that were more important, representing a deliberate suppression of political optimism and its replacement with a new system of belief, the ‘myth of the soul’ at the core of the Intimations ode. For the disenchanted Wordsworth, latching on to new ideals in the poem,‘there are victories’, wrote Levinson, 
far greater than those once anticipated from the French Revolution. Rather than grieve over those mundane losses, the reader is exhorted to set his sights on those other and spiritual palms . . . the ‘soothing thoughts that spring / Out of human suffering.’ (Wordsworth’s Great Period Poems 93–4, 98–9) 
Such an approach has perhaps proved so influential because it helps to explain, and perhaps even authorise, Wordsworth’s rather forlorn retreat from his youthful idealism. </Text>

            <Text>I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.</Text>

Although much of Drucker’s discussion of our contemporary relationship to visual interfaces is tangential to this project, her monograph includes a highly-relevant discussion of the use of data visualizations in varying disciplines. This discussion expands on her 2011 article “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” (Digital Humanities Quarterly 5.1) to highlight the importance of avoiding a false appearance of observer-independent objective truth in humanities visualizations. Her warnings will continue to shape my own creation and use of visualizations as I seek to make sense of my large bodies of information.

            <Title>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London</Title>
            <Text>George Taylor’s The French Revolution and the London Stage, 1789–1805 (2000), follows the same general line of argument. Taylor shows that although smaller theatres had been able to avoid the Lord Chamberlain’s restrictions at the time the Revolution broke out, and had therefore been able to exhibit some enthusiastic dramatisations of events in Paris, censorship was quickly imposed across all London theatres. This forced engagement with the Revolution to become more covert. Censorship meant that British radical writers ‘had to relinquish the theatre as a means of rational instruction’, and political comment was forced into seemingly unlikely theatrical modes: musical entertainments, pantomimes, and above all a new offshoot of the gothic, the melodrama (99). Throughout the 1790s, Taylor argues, political anxieties and hopes were represented by metaphor, images of imprisonment, blindness or dispossession being routinely employed as veiled but recognisable references to current events.

            <Title>DH as historical breach</Title>
            <Text>“Digital humanities” is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke’s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified “digital humanities” work.</Text>

He spoke of Cowper as the best modern poet. He said the Lyrical Ballads were an experiment about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been attempted, and making use only of such words as had probably been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.”</Text>

            <Title>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993</Title>
            <Text>Paula Backscheider’s book Spectacular Politics (1993) goes furthest in investigating the cultural and political significance of the also very neglected gothic plays – a ‘popular literary mode’ in the 1780s and a ‘mania’ in the 1790s (149). In Backscheider’s analysis these plays were easily applicable to the politics of the 1790s, over and over again depicting villainous aristocrats violating the sanctity of life, liberty, property and female chastity, and powerful crowds able to overthrow them. But, she quickly adds, ‘Year by year, the plays show stronger and stronger strategies of containment’ (226). They characterise mob-rule as being just as inimical as despotism, and they represent the virtuous and legitimate protagonists as able to conquer abuses and restore order though non-confrontational means. Ultimately then, the plays ‘propagated a comforting vision of community, of human nature, and of a providential, benignly ordered world’ (232). More powerfully still, they provided a safety valve for a nervous and agitated public: 
By acting out repressed anxieties and hopes in overt and symbolic representations, the plays released tensions and made social contradictions momentarily innocuous. Social antagonism became opportunities to demonstrate the idealized British self-image and to confirm that no revolution was needed in their country . . . The aristocrats could be restrained and the poor would be taken care of . . . Conflict became spectacle, a containable and consumable product. (233)

Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.</Text>

            <Title>proposal intro</Title>
            <Text>My current thinking on my dissertation consists of a series of questions which are, ultimately, about the construction of written canons. As I pose these questions, I am concerned with some interrelated dichotomies which fall out of this larger question: popularity versus seriousness, timeliness versus timelessness and marginalization versus canonization. I want to ask how works that are now considered serious and timeless have achieved their prominent positions, and examine “unserious” or ephemeral works that reward further consideration. I thus wade directly into some of the most complex and contentious concerns of literary studies; my goal is to contribute something novel in my computational approaches, while taking part in the constant evolution of the current “canon.”
My introduction establishes the vocabularies that I will use. Chapter one engages with the problem of archival gaps, to ask how existing digital corpora of eighteenth century literature represent the 1790s, establishing a foundation of knowledge for the following chapters. Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. In keeping with my contention that literary works must be considered as still “active” even after their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered as important “1790s literature” due to prominent re-printing. My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on another set of widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. My fifth chapter brings together these lines of thought, to ask what relationship “serious literature” had to the “non-literary”, and especially to “sub-literary” fiction, in the 1790s.</Text>

            <Text>“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)
“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)
“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and tht there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

“The "favorite authors" are all women: Anna Maria Bennett, Regina Maria Roche, Elizabeth [sic] Meeke, Agnes Musgrave, Anna Howell, Mary Charlton, Isabella Kelly, Elizabeth Parsons, Elizabeth Bonhote, and Anna Maria M’Kenzie.” (39)

"Lane claims "All the Works complete of Robertson, Johnson, Henry, Hume, Locke, Pope, Rapin, Goldsmith, Milton, Smollett, Richardson, Garrick, Gibbons, Voltaire, Addison, Rollin, Littleton, Sterne, Shakespeare, Bolingbroke, Fielding, &amp;c.," as well as “every Author of the present Age”” (40)

"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels." (42)

“At the Minerva Press, William Lane, who had printed 11 items in the 1770s and 131 in the 1780s, produced 402 in the 1790s.” (48)

￼(P. 50)

"Of a total of 1036 works published between 1790 and 1820, on average 27% are texts other than novels. ... these texts include 67 different types of compilations, including collections of maxims, sermons, hymns, fairy tales, fables, songs, jokes, and travel accounts, as well as 52 books of instruction on a wide range of subjects including spelling, cooking, brewing, parenting, farriery, medicine, and military matters.” (52)

"I did not take my set of sub-genres from any pre-existing list, but developed it through my own reading of several hundred Minerva novels." (54)

compare discussion of use of "Romance" in title to the Handbook?

“works may be classified in more than one category. Thus, a work may appear in two categories within a table (as in both epistolary and sentimental) or be listed in both tables (as in translation and courtship).” (56)

￼(57)

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

difficulty of identifying sentimental and sensation novels ... "I have tried to address this difficulty in the gothic category by separating gothic and gothic elements into two mutually-exclusive categories... The difference between the categories is of degree rather than kind.” (58)</Text>

Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.</Text>

The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics.

            <Title>embrace of marginalization</Title>
            <Text>me I think I've talked to you about this also? the escapist fantasy, in a novel where women are powerless to do anything but cry when kidnapped, is that the crying will work
hbbo oh, huh--I don't think we have had this conversation, but that makes a lot of sense
me I've been thinking, also, about the virtues of the Gothic as a narrative mode which doesn't truck with any bullshit about women's place in the world. Powerful men are tyrants who can destroy you! Your feelings are correct on that front! You are excruciatingly vulnerable! And now here is a story where everything turns out okay anyway.
hbbo yes. a space in which to really lug out all those repressed anxieties and blow them up as big as they're able to go can be very cathartic for sure and not only cathartic but useful
me yeah, yeah The contemporary narrative of an "empowering" story for women is about women having power, and indeed a lot of criticism looks at these works to try to find the particular womanly kinds or spheres of power that make the texts "subversive" or "progressive"... and I do see some of that, there is a compelling thread of women having access to emotional manipulation of men as an effective strategy that makes men look foolish and less powerful
hbbo /me nods
me but I think for the most part they're not trying to say, "you have the incredible power of emotional manipulation!" -- I really think they're wallowing in the abjectness of acknowledging powerlessness and, this is the part that has been firing up my soul, the thing you can do, when you have no power, is you can refuse to endorse your oppressor's actions
hbbo /me nods
me this is a bit of a fantasy too, really, but it's one that speaks to me -- the idea that as long as you make them FORCE you, as long as you don't capitulate, that's -- it's not POWER, but..... hands in the air this is where I don't know what I'm saying yet
hbbo no, yeah, it's at the very least a sort of sovereignty over the self
me ooooooh, yeah sovereignty is a good term for it
me hmm, I'm thinking now that there's also a sort of exposure of tyranny, too. If you refuse to walk with your kidnapper and force him to carry you, you deprive him of some of his illusions
hbbo right I feel like this comes up a lot in like idk, narratives of long captivity, I'm trying to think of examples
me oh, yeah, there would be a connection there
hbbo like in 1984, he talks a lot under torture but it's not until he voluntarily betrays his lover that his selfhood is really broken
me ohhhh, yeah man, I read that novel like a decade too young to get anything out of it, I should revisit it
hbbo I mean, DEBATABLE how voluntary that really is if your alternative is getting your face eaten off by rats, but still
me well, the 18thC heroine ideal is to literally die before, say, signing paperwork allowing someone to take her ancestral property
hbbo yeah I read it ages ago as well ahahahahaha yes
me but that feels like part of the fantasy, this idea that you actually will just get your face eaten off by rats before you betray your own self even if in all other interactions you are timid and delicate 1984 of course not being interested in fantasy</Text>

            <Text>The dissertation as a whole, then, looks at the same large body of texts (works printed in England 1789-99) through several different, but interconnected, lenses. Only some of these lenses have specific computational projects in mind already, but all of them ask questions at a scale where I know I will want at least a spreadsheet, and quite probably much more, in order to bring together the many pieces of information that I examine. I expect some works and lines of thought to re-emerge in multiple chapters as I clarify the connections between my central concepts.</Text>

            <Title>account for variety with information density</Title>
            <Text>Minard is actually making a strong and brutal argument in his chart -- against war, against Napoleon, and against history as the biography of celebrity. I need to do a lot of actual research first, to figure out what I think is true, and why I think it, but I will know that I have succeeded, I think, if I can produce something half so rich and persuasive.

Right now this means that I am throwing out my current dissertation outline, which separates things based on which corpus I am pulling my information from. I will describe my methods in the most voluminous appendices the department has ever seen if I must (and I strongly suspect that, in the end, I must) but I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.

I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.</Text>

            <Text>IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability
Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?</Text>

            <Title>Special Fields list rationale</Title>
            <Text>Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’</Text>

            <Title>intro - archive formation</Title>
            <Text>What is the print landscape of the 1790s actually like? As opposed to our filtered versions via academics, subsequent generations of writers
All my terms (seriousness, timelessness, etc) are reasons a work might be canonized — clarifies my interests by ‘zooming out’ to the framework of the canon
Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. (But stay away from seeing Romanticism as starting here; I’d have to do a lot of work to justify to scholars the beginning of Romanticism in the 1790s)
A lot of my questions aren’t quite about canons, they’re about ARCHIVES, which are related but without the idea of cultural capital; do our archives just reflect our canons? — Marisett - how the dewey decimal system systematically excludes african american authors of the 20thC — data production (of course it’s really all capta — the things you choose, and also the things that are made available for capture; shaped by choices and by constraints)
Is it even possible to get back to that initial moment before the archive formation began? I’m going to try! Undoing the misperception of what we begin with “before” the archive, and the perception of what is produced by DH
Mention that I am writing my own code, and that I think it’s crucial to read code and critique its algorithmic assumptions. Very explicit about methods. 2015 NSF report on reproducibility of research. My methods have to be able to explain how they are trustworthy.</Text>

            <Text>Writing Timeliness
Whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand, texts take on shifting meanings as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and recontextualized over time. The changing impact of works over time is most obvious in overtly political works like Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, whose relationship with, for example, Helen Maria Williams’ Letters from France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men was directly determined by the extent to which the works in question were considered to have been borne out by political events. But time-sensitive readings, and an expected textual responsiveness for current events, extended to to literary works as well.
Novels which, in scholarly editions, give the illusion of being singular, unified objects are nearly all the result of a more complicated and responsive process of coming into being. As Tristram Shandy was composed and published, for example, each new installment slightly shifted its emphasis, so that the emerging narrative only gradually solidified into what are, in retrospect, its major concerns. Particularly notable is the way that volumes 7 through 9 of Tristram Shandy, written after the publication of The Castle of Otranto, incorporate Gothic materials differently than the earlier volumes; rather than being one text with one interpretation of the role of the supernatural in heightening readerly emotion, Shandy was a phenomenon which unfolded and varied over time. Even works which were not printed in installments, like Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and Walter Scott’s Waverley, could change in content and in popular reception with a new edition.
Similarly, Lyrical Ballads is often studied in the context of its 1798, 1800, and 1802 editions, but William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge seem to have been following standard poetic practice by writing new prefaces, selecting new poems, and re-editing their works for a new emphasis. Charlotte Smith enacts similar changes across the dozen editions of Elegiac Sonnets printed between 1784 and 1812. Smith’s 1797 edition, for example, includes a new preface, re-selects the non-sonnet poems, and adds new sonnets to create a “new” work out of poems which were as many as thirteen years old. The edition presents her as a politically engaged poet, directly relevant to the events of her day, whose radical philosophies are salient even in her earliest sonnets.</Text>

            <Text>This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. </Text>

This collection of essays recaptures the development in Moretti’s career of his theories of literary history as evolutionary and as an imbalanced center-periphery system of exchange, alongside his increasing use of computational methods that come to be known as ‘distant reading.’ Moretti’s interest in accounting for the “great unread” of literature, and his use of computational models to carry out comparative research, provides much of the theoretical background for my own methods. </Text>

It also makes it easier to sub in less "important" authors, when you're looking for a work to fill just one chronological slice rather, than an author whose ouevre will be broadly applicable.</Text>

            <Title>David Brewer abstract</Title>
            <Text>The recent quantitative turn in literary studies has reminded us of the breadth and variety of the literary field of the past. In so doing, however, it has necessarily levelled out the felt distinctions between various texts, and so risks working against the very sort of literary history that its new vistas promise: one which does justice to the workings of form across time and space. In particular, the presumptive interchangeability of texts that is required to put them into a series susceptible to quantitative analysis ignores the massively different footprint left by commercially successful (and socially canonical) texts as we move beyond their moment of initial publication. Evelina, for example, may have been just another novel of 1778 when it first appeared, but it loomed far above all other productions of that year a decade later (or anywhere beyond the metropole). Such footprints, I argue, changed the significance of their texts’ form, making it seem richer, thicker, more resonant or definitive—perhaps, for some, more stifling or oppressive—than that of their apparently similar but less successful counterparts.</Text>

are all my chapters going to be “compare two authors and how they use one genre”?
are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?
if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format (though I could add people who wrote plays!!)
and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?
or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More &amp; Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”
and that’s the one where I talk about my emerging theory of timeliness

            <Title>Coleridge wrote "We Are Seven"</Title>
            <Text>“My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-'A little child, dear brother Jim,' —I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jim.” (WW)

And it’s even an IN JOKE, and he uses the stanza just as Coleridge wrote it, deleting the joke without replacing it with anything!! This is not transcendent inspiration and individual genius. (He had long left behind the mountain and the girl when he wrote; he was thinking about tea time!)

— It is perfectly fine to be thinking about tea time; the poem is still wonderful. But the myth simply doesn’t work.</Text>

This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expand- ing audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3

            <Text>The poetry certainly circulated outside its novelistic content -- in the case of Udolpho, two of the main character's poems were actually published separately in periodicals beforethe novel. But the songs and poems included in novels seem to be there in part to "elevate" and grant respectability to the fiction -- Udolpho mentions a ballad, but doesn't print it. So perhaps the somewhat disreputable nature of popular ballads could be tempered by literary or moral intervention, but only when that was the only literary project going.

            <Text>Is there a way in which this can be said to be, overall, about how texts do or don't 'enter' a 'canon' of writings - by which you mean, as per e.g. Guillory or Bourdieu, and the idea of cultural capital, a set of texts studied, produced, valued (to varying degrees over time) within certain cultural fields, most especially the field of academic research (but also education, modern publishing, creative industries etc). And then your contribution to the many discussions that go on about (and indeed change) canon, is to bring show we can use digital tools to ask and answer that question? I think maybe it is, and if that is the case, then you need to say just that, and that the other issues - timelessness, popularity, marginalization, immediacy, fall out of that larger question… If you frame it like this, and I think I am suggesting you should, it will force you to have a preliminary chapter or part of the introduction where you review terms/concepts like ‘popularity’ or indeed, canon, or ‘marginalization’ - all of which have their own literatures, outside of DH, but also sometimes in or adjacent it (see e.g. the arguments of Lesser, Farmer, Blayney about Shx’s popularity as measured by edition output and print runs - which used some very basic data tools). You need this because at the moment, you just jump into the studies without the framing questions well established. Such a chapter/intro would also enable you to deal directly with the way that other researchers in your fields (18thC and DH) have already tried to address these questions using different approaches, among them editing (new canons) or distant reading. 

This initial chapter/introduction  I am imagining would also deal with “why 1790s literature” and who else treats the 1790s as a period worthy of cordoning off like this (thus, who your scholarly interlocutors are). 

Finally, you’ve not tried to articulate the queer theory piece here. I think you should, perhaps by thinking with something like this… https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/406/406.pdf. What would be the special character of a non-extractive/anti-oppressive/less neo-lib or conservative or colonial  DH approach to the ‘canon of 1790s’ literature. </Text>

(For one of many, many examples in this book, see Liu's brilliant discussion of "atmosphere" in landscape painting and poetry from essentially the Middle Ages to Wordsworth in his chapter on Wordsworth and the picturesque--in a few brief pages, one gets an incredibly helpful art history account that also illuminates Wordsworth's poetry)</Text>

“Kirwan praises Ward Elliot and Robert Valenza’s “call for acknowledgement of uncertainty (a productive agnosticism rather than a reactionary atheism or unquestioning faith),” concluding the section with the dictum that “critics should be as willing to lose Shakespeare as to find him””
“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””
“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha. In so doing, Kirwan proposes to continue destabilizing the monolithic “Shakespeare,” a project he traces back two decades.”
“a startlingly diffuse, unexpectedly consistent corpus of plays linked by company ownership, rather than by what he argues is the anachronism of authorial ownership.
Motivated to trouble “post-Romantic ideals of individual authorship””
“Boldly, he offers agnosticism to replace the “did-didn’t binary.” This yields “the possibility of Shakespeare’s contribution” to Locrine (137) or a proposed differentiation between “Shakespearean” and “by Shakespeare” (161). This third chapter may inflame more controversy than anything else in the book.”
“the field of attribution studies desperately needs critical metacognitive appraisals of its methods, its successes, and its failures. Kirwan’s assessment of and engagement with attribution studies ought to be cited for years to come”
“Having proven the constructedness of “Canon” and “Apocrypha,” having demonstrated the viability of collaboratively created drama, and having questioned the use and availability of “certain” attributions, Kirwan performs his crowning disruption—to “redefine the meanings of both ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘complete’ in a bid to offer multiple configurations of canon” (205). Here and throughout, Kirwan affirms canons, not a Canon.”
“Kirwan’s final chapter models alternative canon-writing practices as evidence of the potentiality of multivalent canons “to provide options instead of answers” dependent upon audiences’ critical participation”</Text>

There is another root. There are a lot more roots. There are also clothes to wash and furniture to mend and a thousand, thousand other household labours, which his wife has been doing!

            <Title>literary celebrity can inhibit legacy</Title>
            <Text>I… think I am actually interested in the role of “celebrity” as related to authors, and the observation that too much / the wrong kind of celebrity during an author’s lifetime counteracts the potential for long-lasting literary fame
though, Radcliffe was also like Austen quite reclusive and resistant to the “celebrity author” role, even after she achieved financial literary success
but, that just meant that salacious stories of her Gothic madness &amp; death circulated unchallenged after she stopped writing and scholars are still trying to figure out what really did happen to her
hmm-- it ties into my general interest of trying to pick my way through my decade of choice, trying on a range of different metrics for “important” and then paying attention to the bodies of texts that come forward as “important” for each metric
and my diss authors (other than Radcliffe) are all attempting to use and cultivate literary fame as one of the ends of their writing
(well, even Radcliffe is cultivating fame, but with less directly political ends)
I picked authors who wrote prolifically in a range of mediums and genres because I am interested in the emerging “reading public” and what it looked like in the 1790s when all that writing and reading got very high-stakes</Text>

            <Text>historian John Barrell’s Imagining the King’s Death (2000). This is a massive and complex book, again written from a Marxist perspective, focussing on the period from the French regicide in 1793 to the British treason trials of 1794–95.It investigates how agents of the British state sought to make the act of imagining the King’s death a treasonable offence. Their argument was that thinking and writing about revolution would promote it, and revolutions, as the French example showed, killed kings. Many (including the juries who tried those arrested for ‘thoughtcrimes’ like these) could not agree, but Barrell shows how both conservatives and radicals engaged with the argument about the political power of imagination. </Text>

Clery tracks the rise of supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news, producing a history of the Gothic that is sensitive to its impact in varying literary contexts. Clery thus provides a model for accounting for the movement of ideas between generic forms, and touches upon many of the key incidents and texts of interest to the first half of my inquiry.</Text>

            <Title>closeness / interest</Title>
            <Text>Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistance. Felski describes this as “a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance -- a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments.” As a scholarly practice to demonstrate this closeness, Felski gestures towards what she terms “neophenomenology,” “a sustained attention to the sheer range and complexity of aesthetic experiences, including moments of recognition, enchantment, shock, and knowledge.” Felski has begun this work by establishing a greater richness for the vocabulary of “identifying” with characters. Determining whether a character is “relatable” enough to “identify with” is often a key concern for undergraduate readers and for 18thC thinkers: Felski distinguishes literary itentification into at least three types, “structural or formal alignment, moral allegiance, and emotional empathy,” which could be useful for untangling the allegiance required of different works of sentimental literature. Felski thus begins to locate “post-critical, rather than uncritical” forms of “serious thinking” which could both shed light on and be modified by eighteenth-century practices.</Text>

            <Title>ESTC wordcloud: titles want to tell provenance</Title>
            <Text>What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:
#
By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!
This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.
Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:
	•	A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
	•	The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &amp;c. In three volumes
	•	A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P
There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017

p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017

p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017

p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: the -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

These results suggest that the language of aesthetic compositionexperiences a substantive change within the eighteenth century and, moreover, give us a chronological outline through which we can begin to -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: pinpoint these transformations -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  these chronological limits coincide with the beginnings of the radical increase in -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017

p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017

p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017

p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017

p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.13: hmm -- I've been trying to resist my impulses toward tidy clustering; sometimes text are outliers, and a long tail is to be expected.. not everything reduces down to a few categories -- Written May 2, 2017

            <Text>The goal of this serious thinking, for Felski, is to remind us “that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized” — a discovery which will “shock” us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite to understant that future ways of life will also be organized differently. For Sedgwick, too, the possibility of “surprise” in a non-paranoid reading, the idea that even the most predictable past events could have unfolded differently, is crucial for imagining change in the future. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing aftershocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that “our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices” are not universal and invulnerable. Robert Miles is one of many to describe the impact of the French Revolution as centred less on individual events, and more on the alarming “historical rupture” which the revolution was seen to constitute. For many, this rupture represented an opportunity for optimism — but many more experienced the turmoil as near-apocalyptic, and even for optimists the sense of impending change was often uncomfortable. Miles argues that a widespread sense of profound change shaped far more than just political thought: “The sense of crisis … linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.” One way that these works were shaped by their context is a heightened sense of timeliness for published works.</Text>

I'm currently fascinated / mesmerized by this 1960s song "The Masochism Tango": youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOe…
Like, it's actually a fun kinky song, right? Except for what feels like a few points that go "too far" (I think strategically) and thus safely turn the whole thing into a "joke" (and therefore something that can be said in public)
Especially the bit at 3:20 about cigarette burns; it gets a laugh, but he sings it straight, and I know folks who'd be into that.
It makes me have more sympathy for people who want to argue that some 18thC Gothics are trying to subversively smuggle in radical ideas despite not fully committing to those ideas
even if you have to pretend that you're only kidding or otherwise 'take it back', to simply say certain things outright in the first place can be powerful..
..and the self-censored versions can circulate publicly in order to get into the hands of people who know how to decode them
So now I'm thinking of how the Toronto gay scene (in the 70s?) would use newspaper articles "warning" people away from dirty sinful gay hotspots, using lots and lots of detail in order to let other gay people know where to go and what to do
I dunno how to put all of that together, but it feels important somehow! How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers?</Text>

            <Title>what to teach: convo with Jack copy</Title>
            <Text>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???</Text>

            <Text>The 1790s in Digital Archives: A Meta-Analysis of Holdings
A major concern regarding digital humanities research is the ability of findings to be “representative.” There is broad understanding that digital archives contain gaps, but little specific knowledge of the nature of those gaps. My project is analogous to a scientific meta-analysis, comparing several major digital collections. I consider all works published in Britain between 1789 and 1799 across six digital archives. The collections examined are heterogeneous, ranging from 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue to 466 XML files created by the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership. I use a range of approaches, including topic modelling, to identify what kinds of literature each corpus emphasizes, and what omissions and errors scholars must be aware of. By comparing the holdings and metadata of these collections, this paper lays groundwork for future scholars to work with digital corpora in a nuanced, selective way.

            <Title>Romantic poets relied upon women</Title>
            <Text>In their own acknowledgement (?), from the beginning, the poet’s occupation and their romantic connection with nature rely upon the support of the women in their lives; certainly Coleridge knew the importance of Dorothy to Wordsworth, and surely knowing of her would have been key to being “in the know” in their whole social circle; effacing these women’s importance wasn’t key to the myth-making yet (?) but was something grabbed ahold of and exaggerated later?</Text>

            <Title>Ch 4: Synthesis / Discussion</Title>
            <Synopsis> Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.

Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.</Synopsis>

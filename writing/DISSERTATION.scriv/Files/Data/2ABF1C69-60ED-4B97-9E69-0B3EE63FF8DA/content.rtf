\f0\fs22 \cf0 \cb2 Smaller collections seem more scholarly, but have some limitations.]\cb1  Whereas the \'91main players\'92 can be easily enumerated for the mega-archives, these specialized collections are numerous. Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle, the Index to the Lady\'92s Magazine (1770 to 1818), or the Novels Reviewed Database (1,836 reviews from\'a0The Critical Review\'a0and The\'a0Monthly Review, 1790-1820). Feminist scholarship in particular has seen the creation of resources like the Orlando Project, the Chawton House library Novels Online, Northeastern University\'92s Women Writers Online and UC Davis\'92s British Women Romantic Poets. The virtue of these collections is that they achieve even greater accuracy and comprehensiveness within their defined scope. The Shelley-Godwin Archive, for example, can reasonably aspire to digitize 
\i every
\i0  known manuscript of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, and to provide these manuscripts in hand-encoded plaintext transcripts.\
However, as is inevitable, these specialized archives have the vices of their virtues: their specialized focus allows them to adapt precisely to their materials, and their idiosyncratic data structures can rarely be combined with other resources. The William Blake Archive, for example, benefits enormously from  \cb3 [attention to images \'97 but this isn\'92t a standard]\cb1 . Similarly, Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E03488EF-FC44-4051-9034-82144B96B6E9"}}{\fldrslt work.}} Unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria: it is only interested in public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. It narrows the field substantially to exclude works which have either ceased to be broadly interesting (as in the case of most forgotten fiction), or which was never particularly interesting (as in the case of almanacs and tax codes). Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but nonetheless an order of magnitude fewer than its more-voracious potential competitors. And, like smaller specialized scholarly archives, Project Gutenberg has tailored its holdings to make it easy for readers to read, and quite difficult for its collection to be applied to any other use. By tailoring the structure of the archive itself to its specific materials, these collections \cb2 [DO SOMETHING GOOD]\cb1 . But they also \cb3 [MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COMBINE THEM]\cb1 .}

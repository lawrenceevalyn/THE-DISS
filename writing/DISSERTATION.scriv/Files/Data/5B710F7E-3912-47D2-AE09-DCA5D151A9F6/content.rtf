\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93Haywood brings to the forefront of current critical discussion the primordial nature of many once neglected cheap literary genres that were essential in the development of radical thought and culture in Britain at the time. This emphasis upon the literariness of the plebeian counter-sphere is at the heart of another of this text\'92s strong suits, namely, the recognition of \'93the people\'92s enlightenment.\'94\'94 (2)\
\
\'93Haywood\'92s juxtaposition of contemporaneous radical and anti-radical cheap publications provides a balanced portrayal of what the people were actually reading and renders the political and social impact of radical literature all the more compelling for all the opposition it faced from rival ideologies which also espoused the cheap publication format as a way into the plebeian reading universe.\'94 (3)}

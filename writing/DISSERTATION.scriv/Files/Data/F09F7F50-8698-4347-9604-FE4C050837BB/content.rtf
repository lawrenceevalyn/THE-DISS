\f0\fs22 \cf0 The 1790s often capture our imagination for their poetic and political revolutions, but beyond Lyrical Ballads and the \'91pamphlet wars\'92 the print mediascape of the late eighteenth century [has a trait].\'a0\
It is hard not to read these texts, anachronistically, for their failures. A medicine that claims to treat scurvy, tubercular swelling, and leprosy, such as the THING advertised in [TITLE], might call to mind the long period of time in which the eighteenth century failed to take notice of the cure for scurvy which was demonstrated experimentally by LIND in YEAR. A chapbook prophecy promising \'93war and rumours of war\'94\
One reason that literary history matters is that the fate of texts like Erasmus Darwin\'92s Zoonomia rests in our hands. As a medical text, Zoonomia is painfully full of failures: it begins from a few fundamentally untenable assumptions, takes them to wild conclusions, and prescribes treatments that seem sometimes beneficial only by accident. Moreover, since it largely follows existing trends in medical theories, even its wrongness is generally overshadowed by the more seminal and illustrative wrongness of XXX (cite scurvy guy). The assessment \'93ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTE\'94 falls far short of the texts own earnest aspiration to BE A NEWTON. [and yet we still respect it too much]}

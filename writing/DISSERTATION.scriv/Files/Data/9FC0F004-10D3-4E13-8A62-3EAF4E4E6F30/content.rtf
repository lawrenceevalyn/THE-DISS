\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93EEBO\'92s relationship with the original STC and Wing is straightforward and clear; EEBO\'92s relationship with electronic ESTC, on the other hand, is less well-known.20 A series of agreements made between ESTC and University Microfilms/ProQuest between 1989 and 1997 allowed EEBO to draw directly on ESTC\'92s existing bibliographical data. Consequently, / every search run on EEBO (with some exceptions) relies, in a fundamental sense, on bibliographical information originally supplied by ESTC \'96 but not in the form that one might expect. First, EEBO heavily edited ESTC\'92s data for its own purposes: certain categories of data were removed (e.g. collations, Stationers\'92 Register entrances), some information was amended (e.g. subject headings), and some was added (e.g. microfilm- specific details). Second, there is no formal mechanism for synchronising the data between the two resources. Occasionally, snapshots of data are sent by EEBO to ESTC but there is no guarantee that a correction or revision made to an ESTC entry will be replicated in the corresponding EEBO entry or vice versa: neither ESTC nor EEBO will necessarily know when the other has made a correction. As both resources continue to amend and expand their bibliographical data for their own purposes, there is an increasing likelihood of significant discrepancy between the two resources. Finally, although EEBO continues to microfilm and digitise, there is no absolute one-to-one correspondence between the pre-1701 entries in ESTC and the materials on EEBO; there are \'96 and will always be \'96 items on ESTC not available on EEBO.\'94 (Gadd 685-6)}

[\cb2 Probable intended structure for this section: one of my concerns is the way that 18thC studies ends ups segregated by genre (even though writers don\'92t confine themselves to one genre); so here\'92s the conversation in poetry, in the novel, in drama; and here\'92s how they\'92re all engaged in the same question about \'91trash\'92 vs \'91treasure\'92; and here\'92s how that dichotomy employs the same techniques of obnoxiously defining \'91literature\'92 through a rejection of the \'91popular\'92, sticking us with Wordsworth, Walter Scott, and a sainted Shakespeare; and here\'92s John Mee and \'91print magic\'92 tying them together.\cb1 ]}

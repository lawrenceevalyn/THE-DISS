\f0\fs22 \cf2 I think I am, really, interested in a different question than Underwood, who is trying to carry out historical research for the purpose of understanding literary history itself. I am motivated more urgently by a perhaps-less-respectable question: 
\i how am I supposed to decide what to read
\i0 ? This is a practical question, and one which many social institutions attempt to answer.\
I\'92m sympathetic to canon-recovery projects, and see continued need in this vein, because I don\'92t trust existing systems to have made their selections based on the same factors which make a text personally rewarding to me.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 This is an unsigned single-sheet document. I know far more about the piece of paper than the contents: the ESTC describes it as 1 sheet ;  1/2\uc0\u8304  with dimensions of 34.6 x 20.8cm and horizontal chain lines. There is also an uncontrolled note saying that the record is based on \'93Lpro copy with other material from 1792\'94\
The shelfmark, HO.42/23 [632], points in the London National Archives to \'93HO 42. Letters and papers. Piece described at item level.\'94 This consists of a whole lot of correspondence sent to the Home Office, which has actually been scanned! Things are stamped with numbers in the upper-right\'85. And OH MY GOD 632 SHOWS A SCANNED COPY OF THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT, FREE TO THE PUBLIC AND RIGHT HERE, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!!!! Image 940 shows the front, and image 941 shows the back. The item has its own record at http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10614791\
To find this image, I had to check the \'93HOLDINGS DETAILS\'94 pane of the ESTC record (a field which somehow I only recently discovered), search the shelfmark at the  London National Archives, and guess that [632] referred not to a page or image number, but to an item.\
\'93Lpro\'94 probably means London/local Public Records Office (former name for National Archives), per Cai}

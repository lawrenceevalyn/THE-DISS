\f0\fs22 \cf0 This dissertation will, nonetheless, make use of digital tools, algorithms, \'93data\'94, and data visualizations to carry out its inquiry. At every possible point, however, the underlying methodology will be made visible, and its assumptions scrutinized. Much of the code underlying this project I have written myself. Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A, accompanied by a plain-language explanation of how it operates. Where I have used closed-source software, Appendix A contains an explanation of my best guess at its underlying process. My exact use of these tools \'97 sufficient for another to replicate my work \'97 is provided in Appendix B. These details are explicated in full in the appendices in order not to over-burden the body of the dissertation, but they are by no means 
\i confined
\i0  to the appendices. Computation is not a \'93black box\'94 to be consulted for simple answers, but an inextricable from my reasoning and argument.}

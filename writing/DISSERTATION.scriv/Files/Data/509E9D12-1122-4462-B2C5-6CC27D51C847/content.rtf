\f0\fs22 \cf0 The desire to distinguish between \'93trash\'94 and \'93treasure\'94 also appears in studies of poetry, which in this period are nearly synonymous with studies of Romantic poetry. Particularly where poetry is examined in light of conflicts with France, analysis of poets\'92 work often doubles as an analysis of their success or failure in the pursuit of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://81FBC577-3BBA-476D-BCA1-F10096E8D5BF"}}{\fldrslt cultural capital}}. For example, Simon Bainbridge, in 
\i British Poetry and the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
\i0 , sees the decade and its poetry through the lens of war. His own interest is in what he terms \'93the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott\'94 \\cite\{Bainbridge:2003uk p.3\}. This framework leads Bainbridge to examine Charlotte Smith alongside Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey, and eventually Walter Scott. In his conception of \'91a national bard\'92 he imagines a particular marriage of poetry\'92s special status as imaginative literature to a specific poet\'92s cultivation of a nationally important public persona. Both poetry and the poet are thus pursuing a particular kind of cultural capital that allows them to rise above their own popularity. Bainbridge frequently discusses strategies of print publication as part of his analysis: a particularly insightful footnote discusses, for example, a poem which circulated both as an ode in a magazine and as lyrics in a broadsheet. Bainbridge observes that \'93texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration\'94 \\cite\{Bainbridge:2003uk p.10\}. However, his explanations of individual print strategies are often hindered by his approach to literature\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3AC077D6-582E-4882-98BB-ABCB9ABDA8C2"}}{\fldrslt cultural capital}}. At one point, for example, he argues that \'93the fact that the\'a0Gentleman\'92s Magazine\'a0was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott\'94 \\cite\{Bainbridge:2003uk p.53\}. I contend that the republication of substantially older works of literature is not a sign that England was destitute of true poetry before Walter Scott, but rather an attempt to solve the challenges to national identity posed by the 1790s\'92 disruption of history.}

\f0\fs30 \cf0 My fifth chapter engages most directly with the vexed uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining \'93Gothic vocabularies\'94 in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without \'93being\'94 Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being \'93unserious\'94 (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about \'93redeeming literary value\'94 in the Gothic.}

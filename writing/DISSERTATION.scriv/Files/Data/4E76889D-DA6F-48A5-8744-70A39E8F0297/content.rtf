\f0\fs22 \cf0 I have attempted, above, to form a narrative about the 1790s. It has little in common with many other narratives of this decade, because it is the product of an intentionally unconventional research methodology.\
The rest of this dissertation has been centrally concerned with the impacts of textual selection, writ large. [PARA ON THIS]\

\f0\fs22 \cf2 Instead, I look at a set of larger archives of more contested \'93scholarly\'94 status: Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. \cf0 Google Books\cf2  may be the most infamous database of books\cf0 . In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an \'93archive,\'94 particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly-accurate metadata collected about them. These rapidly-scanned books are prone to unpredictable errors, including inaccurate dates, misspellings, duplicate copies, and inaccurate subject {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://BEAF098E-08D3-4B17-B35D-87CE079C4A88"}}{\fldrslt classifications}} \'97 infamously, many books have \'931899\'94 assigned as their publication date because this date was used as a placeholder for \'93no {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E14C1374-74B7-49E0-BBF7-CF5A15CA98D6"}}{\fldrslt date\'94.}} Nonetheless, Google Books is frequently used to study the prevalence of various \'93n-grams\'94 (words or short phrases) over time, thanks to Google\'92s built-in tool. The tool is able to search books which are, for copyright restrictions, not available directly to readers, making it highly tempting for questions about contemporary language use.}

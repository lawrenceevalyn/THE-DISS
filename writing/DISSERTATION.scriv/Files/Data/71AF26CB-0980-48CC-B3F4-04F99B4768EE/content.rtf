\f0\fs22 \cf0 The best known mega-archive is, of course, Google Books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an \'93archive,\'94 particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: \cb2 [CONTENTS OF GOOGLE BOOKS]\cb1 . \cb2 [ERRORS IN GOOGLE BOOKS]\cb1 . Nonetheless, Google Books is frequently used to study the prevalence of various \'93n-grams\'94 (words or short phrases) over time. Similarly, Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://AEFE961A-83CF-4980-BFC9-0CC024D5C085"}}{\fldrslt work.}} \cb2 [CONTENTS OF PROJECT GUTENBERG.]\cb1  Similar in scope to Google Books but with more limited research tools is the Internet Archive. \cb2 [CONTENTS OF INTERNET ARCHIVE.]\cb1  Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and the Internet Archive are not \'93canonical\'94 sources of texts, but they are nonetheless part of the ecosystem of digital eighteenth century studies. Moreover, as in eighteenth century texts themselves, the boundary between \'93canonical\'94 and \'93noncanonical\'94 digital archives is a permeable one: Google Books is also being integrated into HathiTrust, \cb2 [EXPLANATION OF HATHITRUST]\cb1 .}

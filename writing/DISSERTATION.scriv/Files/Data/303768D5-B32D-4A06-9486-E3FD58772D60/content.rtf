\f0\fs22 \cf2 For the purposes of this chapter, I examine Smith\'92s works which fall outside this dissertation\'92s decade of interest. As Table <$n#table:Smith-4dbs> shows, Smith\'92s publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith\'92s \'93full\'94 output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. Her 1790s output (that is, the editions published 1789-99) consists of 30 of those editions.\cf3   Her 1790s output (that is, the editions published 1789-99) consists of 30 of those editions. I have slightly expanded my chronological focus in part because some of the most interesting exclusions occur earlier and later in Smith\'92s publishing career, such as the first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), which is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere, or the publications in the last years of her life, which are excluded from the chronological focus of most resources but can still appear in HathiTrust. Of particular interest is the fact that Beachy Head, which is now one of Smith\'92s most frequently anthologized and taught poems, does not appear in a single digital database.\

\f0\fs22 \cf2 For the purposes of this chapter, I will occasionally examine Smith\'92s works which fall outside this dissertation\'92s decade of interest. As Table <$n#table:Smith-4dbs> shows, Smith\'92s publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith\'92s \'93full\'94 output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. Her 1790s output (that is, the editions published 1789-99) consists of 30 of those editions.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Bainbridge frequently discusses strategies of print publication as part of his analysis: a particularly insightful footnote discusses, for example, a poem which circulated both as an ode in a magazine and as lyrics in a broadsheet. Bainbridge observes that \'93texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 10\cf2 )\cf0 . However, his explanations of individual print strategies are often hindered by his approach to literature\'92s cultural capital. At one point, for example, he argues that \'93the fact that the\'a0Gentleman\'92s Magazine\'a0was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 53\cf2 )\cf0 . I contend that the republication of substantially older works of literature is not a sign that England was destitute of true poetry before Walter Scott, but rather an attempt to solve the challenges to national identity posed by the 1790s\'92 disruption of history.}

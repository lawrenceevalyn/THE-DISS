\f0\fs22 \cf0 \cb2 [\cf3 But \'93critical\'94 is literally in the name of \'93critical algorithm studies\'94\cf0 ; I \cf3 still \cf0 want to be post-critical and reparative.]\cb1  As I encounter the limitations of the various information and tools through which I attempt to understand the 1790s, my goal is to do something other than facilely observe that they are limited. Instead, I want to identify the best ways to continue building on their foundations. In a digital humanities context, a focus on building connections can be mundanely practical: typing indexes from print works into spreadsheets, correcting errors within datasets, writing programs to process metadata: all of these maintain the functional usability of existing resources in new contexts. When this kind of extended, detail-oriented labour is combined with serious reflection on the histories and possible futures of these resources, I contend, they bring us to new knowledge. In this, maintaining and using digital resources is also a way to repair them \'97 and to produce reparative readings of their contents.}

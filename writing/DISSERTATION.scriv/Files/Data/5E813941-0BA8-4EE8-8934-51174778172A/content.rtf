\f0\fs22 \cf0 It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia. Eve Sedgwick persuasively describes, in \'93Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading,\'94 the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism \\cite\{Sedgwick:2015up\}. Rita Felski, in her article \'93After Suspicion\'94 and then further in her recent monograph 
\i The Limits of Critique
\i0 , continues in Sedgwick\'92s line. Felski asks: \'93Can we be postcritical \'97 as distinct from uncritical?\'94 \\cite\{Felski:z11z1lQx p.151\}. Reparative readers are often critiqued for painting a much clearer picture of the paranoid mode than the reparative mode, leaving it unclear how one is meant to escape paranoia\'92s double-bind. But this is not to say that the attempt itself is unworthy. \cb2 [CONCLUSION HERE - DH somehow?]\cb1 . }

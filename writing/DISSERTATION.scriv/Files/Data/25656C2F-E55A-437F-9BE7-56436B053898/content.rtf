\f0\fs22 \cf0 What makes Google Books of interest in the context of this dissertation is its relationship to HathiTrust, an increasingly popular resource for scholars. HathiTrust\'92s collection contains digitized content from \'93a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house member institution initiatives.\'94 The \'93in-house member institutions\'94 include one hundred and fifty-five universities, colleges, and consortia of universities. The aggregate scholarly authority of these institutions carries the weight of elevating HathiTrust above the Google Books scans which form the backbone of much of its contents: \'93The members ensure the reliability and efficiency of the digital library,\'94 the website assures us, \'93by relying on community standards and best practices.\'94 The texts themselves are stored in the database as facsimile page images and full-text OCR transcripts. In order to comply with copyright law, however, HathiTrust only provides large\cf2  \cf0 scale downloads and OCR transcripts for texts which are in the public domain. Most scholars use HathiTrust to run experiments on OCR transcripts of copyrighted texts, which they can only access through computational workarounds that intentionally make it impossible for the scholar to see the full transcript {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://11F18703-D8CC-4888-B729-DC3E24760DDC"}}{\fldrslt itself.}} \cf2 These tools\cf0  provide a unique solution to real barriers for \cf2 digital \cf0 scholars of contemporary literature\cf2 : although copyright law would make it prohibitively expensive or even impossible to build corpora of post-1920s literature, HathiTrust\'92s mediated access to these texts enables corpus analysis. \cf0 Through its collection, HathiTrust provides a hodgepodge of texts, of often unverifiable provenance and accuracy, selected largely by happenstance and convenience in a quest to contain all printed books. Through its tools, however, and through its institutional affiliations, HathiTrust has acquired a cultural cap\cf2 i\cf0 tal among scholars which Google Books still lacks.}

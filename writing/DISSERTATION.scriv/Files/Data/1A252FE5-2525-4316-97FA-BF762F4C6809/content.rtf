\f0\fs22 \cf0 We focus on exceptional cases \'97 but I don\'92t think we even know, reliably, which cases were exceptional. Burke gets taught to undergraduates as a consummate conservative position, but his argument concedes far more to radical views than Jones\'92 \'93We ought, therefore, to renounce and detest that abominable doctrine, that the power of government is from the people who are governed. We see now immediately how false and contradictory is this principle, that the subject should be the sovereign.\'94 (8) The appeal of Burke seems to be partly a genuine popularity/prominence in his day (though this has not preserved Goldsmith for us!) and partly that Burke\'92s conservatism is acceptably within the Overton window of our current day; it is possible to take him seriously in a way we cannot respect Jones.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is "taken" actively while data is assumed to be a "given" able to be recorded and observed.\'94 (3)\
\'93the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework\'94 \'85 \'93The graphical force conceals what the statistician knows very well \'97 that no "data" preexist their parameterization\'94 (8)\
\'93the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a "picture" of "data".\'94 (12)\
\'93In some circumstances (the example of the bar chart given earlier that was displaying information about gender, nations, and populations) ambiguity merely requires a higher order level of complexity in the model, so that apparent "certainties" are qualified by variables and nuances that can be specified in mathematical terms. But the idea of capta as fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena, is fundamentally different from the concept of data created as an observer-independent phenomena.\'94 (50)}

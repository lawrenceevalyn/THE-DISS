\f0\fs24 \cf0 For example, a typical title in the English Short Title Catalogue for the decade is \'93The injustice and impolicy of the slave-trade, and of the slavery of the Africans: illustrated in a sermon preached before the Connecticut Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Persons Unlawfully Holden in Bondage, at their annual meeting in New-Haven, September 15, 1791. / By Jonathan Edwards, D.D. Pastor of a church in New-Haven. ; To which is added, A short sketch of the evidence for the abolition of the slave-trade, delivered before a committee of the British House of Commons.\'94 The usefulness of this title, as an advertisement for (if not necessarily an accurate representative of!) the work\'92s content, I argue, presents an opportunity unique to the eighteenth century. The eighteenth century is often dismissed as unsuitable for computational distant reading because eighteenth century printed type produces very low-quality OCR transcripts \'97 but a focus on OCR-based distant reading itself seems to me like a response to the poverty of paratextual material in later literature. }]]></Comment>

\f0\fs22 \cf0 In chapter three, I synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, to examine questions about the popularity of texts in 1790s print culture.\'a0I begin by creating my own \'91superset\'92 database of all records. I then query this database through random sampling and topic modelling. Both random sampling and topic modelling, as methodologies, allow me to examine information outside of its pre-designed data structures. Random sampling, which Steven Zwicker \\cite\{Zwicker:2006ck\} and Leo Lahti, Niko Ilom\'e4ki, and Mikko Tolonen \\cite\{Lahti:2015dd\} have applied successfully to the English Short Title Catalogue\'92s holdings, makes it feasible to apply a greater level of human scrutiny to a large body of texts. Topic modelling makes it feasible regularize otherwise-disparate materials without imposing a pre-defined {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://344A113F-1B0C-47E2-9279-6A22E388A3F8"}}{\fldrslt ontology}}. My use of topic modelling differs somewhat from its typical use in literary distant reading, which generally applies topic models to the full text of literary works, and examines topics themselves as proxies for subtle elements of textual content. I model only the titles of works, taking advantage of the eighteenth century\'92s distinctively rich title {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://8620278F-F09B-4CBE-869E-430B8C9A2E7C"}}{\fldrslt conventions.}} Both of these methods allow me to use my \'91superset\'92 database to ask questions about 1790s literature itself. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer\'92s articulation of \'93structures of popularity,\'94 I consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After presenting my proposals for how to calculate each of these metrics, I ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? Many of the most reprinted works substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer\'92s challenge to account for the increased \'93footprint\'94 of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important \'931790s literature\'94 due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry\'92s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as \'93popular literature.\'94}

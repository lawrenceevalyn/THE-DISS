\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'9316 In his discussion of JSTOR's "intolerably corrupt" OCR text, Nicholson Baker suggests that the reason why the user is prevented from scrolling through this naked OCR output is that scholars "might, after a few days, be dis- turbed by the frequency and strangeness of its mistakes . . . and they might no longer be willing to put their trust in the scholarly integrity of the database."17 Baker's criticism of JSTOR, however, is based on an error rate (with editorial intervention) of just one typo in every two thousand characters.\'94 (Spedding 439)\
\'93The two OCR-captured texts average over 150 typos per 2,000 characters,22 a high enough error rate to render parts of the text completely unintelligible. It is not clear how typical this error rate is, and how much it declines with editorial intervention,23 but again the scale of the problem is clear.24 Consequently, the claim that OCR errors "may occasionally result in incorrect character capture, which may affect some [ECCO] full-text search results," seems wildly, even heroically, optimistic.\'94 (Spedding 440)}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 I created a \'93content set\'94 called ECCO-1798 in Gale Digital Scholar Labs, by searching for all works in ECCO published \'93between\'94 1798 and 1798. This located 4,158 records. I downloaded the metadata for these 4,158 records as a CSV. I then used random.org\'92s \'93Random Integer Generator\'94 to generate ten integers from 1 to 4,158 (inclusive), resulting in the following numbers: 1792, 2365, 159, 3511, 919, 170, 2136, 2259, 190, and 2242. I looked up the ten works appearing in those rows of the spreadsheet, without altering the order of the records from Gale\'92s default. (It is unclear to me what sorting method was used to organize them in the document.) I used the Gale Content Numbers of these ten works to create a new \'93content set\'94 of just these ten titles.}

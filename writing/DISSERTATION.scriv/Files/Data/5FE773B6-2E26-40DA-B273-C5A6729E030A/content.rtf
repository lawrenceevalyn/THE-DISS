\f0\fs22 \cf0 Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. My design vocabulary is drawn from the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments. Neither Tufte nor Cairo is a scholar of media studies; rather, they are professional practitioners of \'91data visualization\'92 who reflect critically on the assumptions of their work. Tufte\'92s work primarily strives to correct badly-designed data visualizations, and the dangerous decisions that bad design can lead people to. His most famous example is an analysis of the scientists\'92 report at NASA which led to the ill-fated launch of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986: as his extensive visual analysis argues, the scientists (untrained in graphic design) unintentionally obfuscated crucial information about the day\'92s launch conditions. Tufte\'92s six principles of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://816937EE-FFED-44CA-92E3-8B2A87D3EF20"}}{\fldrslt design}} primarily seek to guide undertrained designers away from misleading themselves. Cairo, following on Tufte\'92s work from the perspective of a data scientist rather than a pure designer, more often turns his attention to successful designs which mislead their audiences intentionally. \cb2 [MORE ON CAIRO]\cb1  Following in both Tufte and Cairo\'92s footsteps, I conceive of the figures throughout this dissertation as rhetorical devices. In service of arguing honestly, therefore, my designs are accompanied by explanations of my design rationale.}

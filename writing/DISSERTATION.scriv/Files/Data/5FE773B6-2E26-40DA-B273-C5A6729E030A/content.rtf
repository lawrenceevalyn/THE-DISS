\f0\fs22 \cf0 Drucker\'92s assessment shapes my own prioritization of qualitative and reflective computational research. The term \'93capta\'94 itself has not seen uptake in subsequent digital humanities scholarship, even in cases where scholars explicitly take Drucker\'92s warnings to heart. Accordingly, for clarity, this dissertation will continue to use the more usual term \'93data\'94 to refer to the information gathered for analysis here. However, as I integrate and compare a wide variety of data from many disparate sources, a preliminary task of my analysis is always to determine, as precisely as possible, how the informations was captured and quantified. Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. The designs themselves are somewhat experimental, and are therefore accompanied by explanations of my design rationale. My design vocabulary is drawn from the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments. \cb2 [EXAMPLE DATA FROM MY MATERIALS] [Conclusion: ??]}

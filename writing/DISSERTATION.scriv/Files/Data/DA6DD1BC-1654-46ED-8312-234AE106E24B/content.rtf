\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'93The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,\'94 especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). \'93Panizzis \'91Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book in\cf2  \cf0 his or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.\'94 (Korshin 211)\

\'93In ESTC the matching process hinges on five points of identity: the title, as far as it is given by ESTC; the edition statement; the imprint, again as far as it is given by ESTC; the pagination; and the format\'94 (Tabor 370).}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Wendy Chun suggests that the problem with much algorithmic inquiry lies in its most core assumption: the insistence that the future must look like the past \\cite\{Chun:2018tq\}. This assumption is essential to any system which exclusively bases its predictions on past data. It is particularly intertwined with what Chun calls \'93homophily,\'94 \'93the axiom that similarity breeds connection\'97which grounds contemporary network science\'94 \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.60\}. Homophily, as it is currently applied to network science, Chun argues, both \'93assumes and creates segregation\'94 \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.76\} in a fashion that allows it to operate \'93like money laundering for bias\'94 \\cite\{Chun:2018tq pp.62-63\}. Importantly, however, the analogy to money laundering is imperfect: it cannot be resolved with \'93better, cleaner data\'94 \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.64\}. Instead, Chun insists, \'93new theories of connection\'97which do not presume a dangerously banal and reciprocal notion of friendship\'97are needed\'94 \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.89\}, a call to action which places its emphasis not on the information provided to an algorithm but on the algorithm\'92s procedures.}

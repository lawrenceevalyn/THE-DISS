\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93However, the path to digitization was not ideal: these documents were imaged in the late 1970s, transformed into microfilm during the 1980s, and the microfilms digitized in the 1990s. Because of the state of reproductive technologies during the late 20th century, as well as the circuitous path to digitization (through microfilm), the image quality is very poor and bitonal, with no greyscale / images available. Furthermore, the original documents themselves, printed with premodern technologies, pose problems even for human readers of their pages, but much more so for optical character recognition (OCR) engines. For example, printed characters were not perfectly situated on a baseline, blackletter fonts were used, ink bled through the paper, and the typeface was broken and overworn.\'94 (Christy et al. 1-2)\

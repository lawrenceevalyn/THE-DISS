\f0\fs22 \cf0 HathiTrust\'92s success in acquiring scholarly capital stands in interesting contrast with Project Gutenberg\'92s continued lack of cachet. Project Gutenberg is used in research with similar frequency to Google Books\'92 n-gram {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://C91C6530-785C-41E2-AF76-CC7E8D70C0FA"}}{\fldrslt tool,}} but scholars \cf2 often\cf0  mention Project Gutenberg with a note of apology for not having found a better source. Its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its actual use and utility, likely, I argue, because its organizing principles are the \'91unserious\'92 ones of popularity and pleasure. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. This criteria \cf2 might not render Project Gutenberg more useful for scholarly work but, it nonetheless \cf0 narrows the field substantiall\cf2 y.\cf0  Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but an order of magnitude fewer than its more-voracious potential competitors.}

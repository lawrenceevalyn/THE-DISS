\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 When working with large literary databases, scholars naturally wish to know what kind of literature they are working with. A high incidence of religious language in an eighteenth century corpus, for example, will mean something different depending on how many of the documents included in the corpus are sermons. However, the larger and more heterogenous the database, the less likely it is that all of its contents have been thoroughly and consistently identified. Eighteenth century texts predate systems such as the Library of Congress subject headings, so many of the holdings in widely-used resources such as the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) include no metadata regarding their contents\'92 subject matter.}

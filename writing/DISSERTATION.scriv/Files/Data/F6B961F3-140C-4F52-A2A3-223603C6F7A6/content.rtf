\f0\fs22 \cf0 Often discussed as synonymous with \'93DH\'94 is a set of practices described as \'93distant reading.\'94 Ted Underwood\'92s \'93Genealogy of Distant Reading\'94 presents a history of distant reading which is not for the most part centrally concerned with computers, and therefore fundamentally distinct from concepts of \'93digital humanities\'94 \\cite\{Underwood:2017uc\}. In Underwood\'92s history, []. As a result, Underwood contends, \'93Distant reading was not coined to describe a radically new method.

\f1\fs22 This interdisciplinary special issue asks how our understanding of these women and their writing might be augmented, or disrupted, by turning our attention to women\'92s books as they were made and circulated in the period and beyond.\cf3  \'85 \cf2 the practices by which women\'92s books were made, sold, exchanged, marketed, read, preserved and collected (and how women engaged in these activities); and that reflect upon what Jerome McGann has described as the interaction between bibliographical and linguistic codes. This special issue also seeks to address how we remediate Romantic women\'92s books today, in archival collections, in critical editions (both print and digital), and in our pedagogy. The overarching question driving this special issue is: what do we gain, and what might we lose, by resituating women\'92s writing and their literary labour within new frameworks of material and bibliographic histories?

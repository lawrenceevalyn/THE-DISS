\f0\fs22 \cf0 Much of More\'92s personal life centred around educational ventures. In 1758, her eldest sister Mary More opened a girls\'92 boarding school, which Hannah More would ultimate assist in running. In 1762, this school moved to larger premises. In 1767, More accepted a proposal of marriage from William Turner, but ultimately their engagement is broken off in 1773, and More never married. More is the \'93permanent house guest\'94 of David and Eva Garrick from 1776 until David Garrick\'92s death in 1779, after which she remains in the household as Eva Garrick\'92s companion. In 1785 she buys  Cowslip Green in Somerset. In 1789, Hannah and Patty More found the first of the Mendip Schools at Cheddar, Somerset; other schools follow at Shipham, Rowberrow, Nailsea, Blagdon and Wedmore (also smaller schools). In 1790, the More sisters hand over the Park Street school to Selina Mills. In 1792, she founds women\'92s benefit clubs at Cheddar and Shipham. 1799 marks the beginning of the \'93Blagdon controversy\'94: \'93one of More's teachers is accused of Methodism; the accusation widens into a series of attacks on More for alleged religious and political subversion; as a result she suffers depression and nervous collapse and for a while is unable to write\'94  until 1802 (Stott). In 1801, she builds Barley Wood, her new Somerset home. In 1813 she founds an auxiliary Bible Society at Wrington.}

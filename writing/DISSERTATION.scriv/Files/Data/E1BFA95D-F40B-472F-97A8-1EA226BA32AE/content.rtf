\f0\fs22 \cf0 These, then, are the three scholarly conversations to which this dissertation contributes: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the theoretical frameworks within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the two experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.}

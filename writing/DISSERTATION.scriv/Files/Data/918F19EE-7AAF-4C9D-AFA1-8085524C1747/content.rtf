\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93It is becoming clear that we have narrated literary history as a sequence of discrete movements and periods because chunks of that size are about as much of the past as a single person could remember and discuss at one time. Apparently, longer arcs of change have been hidden from us by their sheer scale\'94 (Distant Horizons ix)\
\'93The deeper problem is that, for the last sixty or seventy years, we have assumed that literary history can only be interesting and edifying insofar as it is a story about conflict.\'94(106)\
\'93In short, this chapter claims to expose a problem in our current approach to literary history. If I am right, an important component of change spreads out across a longer arc than our theories and narrative strategies have been able to reveal. But I don\'92t claim to have resolved the problem, either intellectually or as a matter of narrative craft.\'94 (109)}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 In contrast to the brevity of Radcliffe\'92s bibliography and biography stands the mountain of secondary writing on her works. At her death in 1823, despite the twenty-six years since her last publication, an outpouring of obituaries marked her as an esteemed literary genius. Much of this praise followed the template so famously set out in Walter Scott\'92s \'91Prefatory Memoir to Mrs Ann Radcliffe\'92 in the tenth volume of James Ballantyne\'92s Novelist\'92s Library series. [\cb2 EXPLAIN SCOTT\'92S WHOLE DEAL \'97 
\f1 \cb2 \'93he nonetheless takes care to defend the unquestionable genius of Ann Radcliffe on at least three accounts: her presiding over \'91a separate and distinct species of writing\'92 (Scott 1824: xx); her ability to sustain her readers\'92 interest and attention across three major novels \'85 / \'85 and her exploration of extreme human passions in appropriately southern European settings\'94 (Townshend and Wright 5-6)

[BASICALLY, JUST ASSUME I HAVE PUT A WHOLE LIT REVIEW ON ANN RADCLIFFE HERE: she\'92s been consistently praised, often in ways that establish the worthlessness of works similar to her; a \'91token\'92 who justifies the exclusion of women or feminine writing. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://9A15EB61-CB47-49D0-A488-B0108E414EF0"}}{\fldrslt A valuable and informative contrast to Smith, Robinson, and More.}}]\
[People often talk about Radcliffe being very directly responsive to reviews of her works in periodicals, changing the aspects that they critiqued most strongly, so she ultimately produces Gothics that reviewers are willing to accept on their own moral terms \'97 and therefore Gothics which subsequent generation are willing to accept/praise?]\

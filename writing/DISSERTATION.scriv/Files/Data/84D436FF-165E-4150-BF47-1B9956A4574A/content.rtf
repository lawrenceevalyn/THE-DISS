\f0\fs22 \cf0 I make an exception for archives which specifically seek to address gaps in archival holdings due to systemic bias, that is, three archives focused on women\'92s writing: Orlando, Chawton, and [I thought there was a third one].\
For the most part archives are either comprehensive and have significantly more than 100 texts, or they are single-author / single-researcher focused, and thus have significantly less than 100. These kinds of reparative projects occupy the middle space.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 There are several different ways to search ESTC records. The \'93Search\'94 button takes a user to the \'93Basic Search\'94 function, from which there are also links to \'93Advanced Search,\'94 \'93Browse,\'94 and \'93Browse Libraries List\'94 (which takes the user to the identical page as \'93Browse\'94 but with \'93Library name\'94 pre-selected as the index to browse). Once you have found a work of interest, however, several new forms fo searching become available, implied in the hyperlink formatting: almost any field in the entry can be clicked to reach other matching ESTC entries.}

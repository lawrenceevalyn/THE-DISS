\f0\fs22 \cf2 The structuring principle of Project Gutenberg is its missions to make books available for pleasure reading. I argue that its core concept, analogous to the \'93edition\'94 in the ESTC, or the \'93book\'94 in ECCO and HathiTrust, is the \'93story.\'94 Many of the priorities of Project Gutenberg which seem incompatible with scholarly approaches to textual history are explained by thinking of Project Gutenberg as being structured around \'93stories\'94 rather than \'93books.\'94}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 As this survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no \'91perfect\'92 corpus for large-scale study of eighteenth-century texts. Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. \cb2 Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to

\f0\fs22 \cf0 As this survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no \'91perfect\'92 corpus for large-scale study of eighteenth-century texts. Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to 
\i do
\i0  with texts. As this dissertation will argue, these questions of digital history have important resonance with literary questions about literary canon formation.}

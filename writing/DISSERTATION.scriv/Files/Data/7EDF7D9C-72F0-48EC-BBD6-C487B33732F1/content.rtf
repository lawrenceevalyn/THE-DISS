\f0\fs22 \cf2 Although each individual database has attracted some discussion, they have not been discussed together as an interlocking system. Instead, each database (or cluster of related databases) attracts discussion within its own conventional sphere.\cf3  Here, I will discuss them together, organized chronologically by decade. A chronological organization makes it clear how many different organizations are in fact responding to shared historical conditions, or even to each others\'92 development, as they make strategic decisions over time. A chronological organization also contrasts with essentially teleological descriptions of individual resources, which tend to work backward from a current state to present a clean narrative of how that current state was discovered to be ideal. By refusing to gloss over dead ends, periods of stagnation, and other oddities, we can better understand the current state of contemporary databases as the outcome of historically contingent processes which might have turned out differently, rather than accepting them uncuriously as inevitabilities.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Therefore, in addition to introducing my case study authors, I now introduce my case study corpora, which will play a role in each chapter.] \cf0 Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes. I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg\cf2  and \cf0 HathiTrust. \cf2 \
\
\cf0 The corpora vary from each other in terms of two main qualities: their size, and their reputation. The reputation of any given digital resource is shaped largely, I argue, by its ability to signal \'91rigour\'92 in its collection practices. Several corpora of different sizes have established reputations of seriousness, and, correspondingly, cultural capital within scholarly communities.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes\cf2 . I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), HathiTrust, ProQuest, the British Library\'92s Nineteenth Century Book Corpus (BL), the Early Novels Database (END), Gale\'92s digitized microfiche of the Corvey collection, Google Books, the Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg.\cf3  For several of these databases, especially HathiTrust, Google Books, and Project Gutenberg, their status as \'91scholarly\'92 or \'91serious\'92 is contested. Chapter two will explore in greater detail the structural logic and the scholarly reception of these databases in light of their 1790s holdings. Since they are the direct object of study of much of the dissertation, however, a general introduction to their contents is useful here. The corpora vary from each other in terms of two main qualities: their size, and their reputation. The reputation of any given digital resource is shaped largely, I argue in chapter two, by its ability to signal \'91rigour\'92 in its collection practices. Several corpora of different sizes have established reputations of seriousness, and, correspondingly, cultural capital within scholarly communities.}

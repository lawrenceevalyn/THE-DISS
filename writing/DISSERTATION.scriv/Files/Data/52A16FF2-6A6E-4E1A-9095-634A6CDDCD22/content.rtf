\f0\fs22 \cf0 Mary Robinson\'92s early biography shares striking resonances with that of Charlotte Smith. Robinson was married at the age of sixteen to a man who squandered his income. Robinson spent more than a year in King\'92s Bench debtors\'92 prison with her husband and infant daughter, from 1774 to 1775, from which she published her first volume of poetry. Rather than immediately taking up the mantle of a professional author, however, in 1776 she became an actress. As an actress, she met increasing success for four seasons \'97 so much so that she attracted the attention in 1779 of the 17-year-old Prince of Wales, who determined to make her his mistress. After a period of semi-public flirtation, Robinson agreed, and retired from the stage. \'93Although the affair lasted less than a year, 'the Perdita' was notorious from then on; her gowns, her carriages, and her alliances became a constant source of discussion and speculation in the newspapers\'94 (Mark Ockerbloom).}

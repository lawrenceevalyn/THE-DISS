\f0\fs22 \cf2 Before delving into the more than fifty years of interlocking institutional histories which have created the current landscape of digital databases in eighteenth century studies, it is worth pausing to observe carefully what that current landscape actually looks like. One way to gain our bearings with an overwhelming quantity of information is to particularize it into anecdote: accordingly, our first look at these resources will be with the guiding figure of Charlotte Smith. Which works by Smith are in which database, why, and how? Another way to understand the pieces is to generalize them into systems: to take this approach, our second look at the same resources will examine graphs of their relative scale and overlapping contents. How does the system as a whole draw boundaries between its parts? Which parts are \'91peers\'92 or \'91colleagues,\'92 which are \'91rivals,\'92 and which do not even acknowledge their presence within the same system?}

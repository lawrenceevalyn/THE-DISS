\f0\fs22 \cf2 Figure <$n#fig:Smith-4dbs-alluvial> is based on the data recorded in Table <$n#table:Smith-4dbs>, which was pasted into the RAW Graphs visualization tool (Mauri et al.) and processed using their default settings for an alluvial diagram. Using an alluvial diagram required imagining the databases as sequential \'93stages\'94 through which all books flow. Accordingly, I added a \'93source\'94 for this flow of books by adding a column labeling every edition as falling into the category \'93Works printed in England, 1784-1807.\'94 I could have chosen to place the following \'93stages\'94 in any order; to assist in visualizing Smith\'92s representation in these databases as a process of winnowing down, I chose to place them in order from largest selection to smallest. The scale of each \'93strand\'94 of the diagram is scaled in width based on the number of editions it represents, as per RAW Graphs\'92 default settings. The colours, fonts, and width of the graph are also simple defaults.}

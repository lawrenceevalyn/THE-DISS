My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://AE2EC1AF-F3B8-4870-8B9F-AE2A66A4C642"}}{\fldrslt print landscape}} in England 1789-99 was actually like  \'97 in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers \'97 and how this print landscape is represented {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://D138D7BF-E6CE-45D4-BE02-8B7D31678599"}}{\fldrslt now, in current digital archives}}. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of \'93popularity\'94 as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://FA3D0346-3F9F-4217-B62F-23E752C165C0"}}{\fldrslt printing practices}}. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.}

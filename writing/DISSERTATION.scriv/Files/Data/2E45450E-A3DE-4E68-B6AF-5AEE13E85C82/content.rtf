My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like \cf2  \'97 \cf0 in contrast to \cf2 the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers \'97 \cf0 and how this print landscape \cf2 is represented now,\cf0  in \cf2 current digital \cf0 archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine \cf2 the idea of \'93popularity\'94\cf0  \cf2 [as a  product of / as it is manifested by]\cf0  print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.}

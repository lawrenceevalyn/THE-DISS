\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Although we talking about text mining projects as revealing information about \'93eighteenth century literature\'94 in fact they can only describe the corpus which is not \'93eighteenth century literature\'94 but in fact a model/sample.] [It is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus.] [If two scholars examine gendered authorship in the eighteenth century using ECCO-TCP and HathiTrust, and reach two opposing conclusions, can this be attributed to different sampling in their corpora?] I examine a very narrow selection of texts \'97 works published in England 1789-99 \'97 across a broad selection of eleven corpora, to compare the resources generally used for studies of eighteenth century literature. The largest bibliographic resource, the English Short Title Catalogue, lists 52,000 texts in England during this decade; the smallest, and most widely used, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership, contains only 486. For each corpus, I determine the relative rates of male, female, and unsigned authorship. I also determine the relative prominence in each corpus of various genres of texts, such as poetry, prose fiction, dramas, sermons, and ephemera. Comparing and correlating this basic information about the contents of each corpus, and contextualizing each corpus within the conditions of its creation, allow me to identify [important exclusions]. I also offer my own picture of the print landscape of the 1790s.}

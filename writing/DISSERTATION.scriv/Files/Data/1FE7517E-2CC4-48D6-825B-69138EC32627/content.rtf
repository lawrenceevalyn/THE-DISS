Over the past twenty years, her life and work have received fresh attention from scholars and biographers who have become fascinated, as her contemporaries once were, with her dazzling personality, social prowess, thespian skill, and literary artistry.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://romantic-circles.org/editions/nobody/HTML/introduction.html#2"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 \strokec5 \'a0[2]}}\'a0Despite this resurgence in interest, however, relatively little is known about Robinson\'92s dramas,\'a0

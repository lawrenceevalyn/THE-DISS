\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'93Having begun as an actress, courtesan and fashion icon, she broke onto the late eighteenth-century literary scene first as that embodiment of sensibility, a Della Cruscan poet. Forging conversation through her writing, she proceeded to make herself a central literary figure of the 1790s, creating authorial identities inextricably linked with other Romantic writers. A prolific writer and increasingly radical thinker, she published in the last ten years of her life four verse collections, six individual long poems, a sonnet sequence, seven novels, two plays, a translation, three political essays, hundreds of poems for different / newspapers and a draft of her memoirs.\'94 (Cross 1-2)}

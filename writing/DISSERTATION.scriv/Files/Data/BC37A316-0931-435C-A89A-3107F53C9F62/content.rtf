\f0\fs22 \cf0 My own sliver of the ESTC was generously provided to me by the British Library in January 2017. It contains all items matching the query I specified, \'93(Words= alldocuments and W-year= 1789->1799 and W-Country of publica= enk),\'94 which requests all documents published between 1789 and 1799 (inclusive) with a place of publication encoded as \'93England.\'94 Running this search on the ESTC website at the time returned 52,001 records. The tools used to create the file, according to the librarian with whom I corresponded, returned 51,965 records, 36 records having gone missing; however, the file itself contains only 51,860, another 105 mysteriously lost. These 141 missing records are currently an unsolved mystery.\cf2 \
\cf0 My records come from the British Library\'92s ESTC database, rather than the STAR file. The corpus itself consists of a csv file with fifteen columns of information.}

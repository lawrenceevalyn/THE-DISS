\f0\fs22 \cf0 I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words \'93Xth edition.\'94\
If this method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ I won\'92t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles?\
Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching\'85 unless it\'92s small enough for me to do manually (unlikely)}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 Commenting on the potential impact of their enumerative bibliography of women in book history, Coker and Ozment say \'93bibliographic lists become the first step towards canon development, and from there to actual disciplinary creation" (6). \

\'93Gathering sources around an idea for which there is no critical consensus is a deeply ideological act that can influence how users will conceptualize the field moving forward.

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Having described a large and complex scholarly context for this work, and made some preliminary efforts toward synthesis of these disparate backgrounds, it is time, now, to describe \cf2 the work undertaken here\cf0  in more detail. This dissertation has two major parts. The first examines the literature of the 1790s through the lens of \'91titles,\'92 and the second through \'91persons.\'92 In both cases my central interest is the vexed category of \'91popularity.\'92 With both \'91titles\'92 and \'91persons\'92, I establish the materials with which I will be working and their implicit models. \cf3 I will draw materials from the English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the ECCO Text Creation Partnership corpus (ECCO-TCP), HathiTrust, ProQuest, the British Library\'92s Nineteenth Century Book Corpus (BL), the Early Novels Database (END), Gale\'92s digitized microfiche of the Corvey collection, Google Books, the Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg. Substantial time is taken to establish the history and constraints of each of these resources to contextualize the role they play in contemporary digital research. \cf0 Using the information they make most readily accessible, I explore which works and individuals emerge as \'91popular\'92 or \'91important\'92 in each\cf3  resource\cf0 . I also probe each \cf3 resource\cf0  for its representation of (or failure to represent) my touchstone authors, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson. The resulting findings are primarily used to evaluate how the underlying digital resources participate in or resist the projects of canon-building. Then, for both titles and persons, there is a \'91turn.\'92 For each area of inquiry I introduce a novel experiment which synthesizes my materials and repurposes them. These experiments are then used to draw conclusions about 1790s print culture.}

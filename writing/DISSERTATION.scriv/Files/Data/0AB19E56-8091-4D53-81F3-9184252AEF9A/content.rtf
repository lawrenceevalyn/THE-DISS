\f0\fs22 \cf0 Having delineated a large and complex scholarly context for this work, and made some preliminary efforts toward synthesis of these disparate backgrounds, it is time, now, to delineate the research born of this context. This dissertation proceeds in two major parts. The first examines the 1790s through the lens of \'91titles,\'92 and the second through \'91persons.\'92 In both cases my central interest is the vexed category of \'91popularity.\'92 With both \'91titles\'92 and \'91persons\'92, I establish the materials with which I will be working and their implicit models. Using the information they make most readily accessible, I explore which works and individuals emerge as \'91popular\'92 or \'91important\'92 in each resource. I also probe each resource for its representation of (or failure to represent) my touchstone authors, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson. The resulting findings are primarily used to evaluate how the underlying digital resources participate in or resist the projects of canon-building. Then, for both titles and persons, there is a \'91turn.\'92 For each area of inquiry I introduce a novel experiment which synthesizes my materials and repurposes them. These experiments are then used to draw conclusions about 1790s print culture.}

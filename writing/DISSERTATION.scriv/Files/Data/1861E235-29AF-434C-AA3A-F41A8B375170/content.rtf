\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'94According to The Edinburgh Review (May 1823), \'91She never appeared in public, nor mingled in private society, but kept herself apart, like the sweet bird that sings its solitary notes, shrouded and unseen\'92. In fact, so little was known about Radcliffe\'92s life in the nineteenth century that Christina Rossetti abandoned a projected biography due to a lack of material\'94 (Facer).\
\'93We do know, however, that Ann Ward Radcliffe was born in Holborn, London, on 9 July 1764. She was the only child of William Ward, a haberdasher, and his wife Ann Oates. Her mother was relatively well connected. Oates\'92s cousin was Sir Richard Jebb, physician to George III, while her brother-in-law, Thomas Bentley, was the partner of Josiah Wedgwood. In 1772, William Ward moved with his wife and young daughter to Bath, where he would manage a china shop partly owned by Wedgwood. The young Ann was reasonably well educated\'85 In 1787 Ann married William Radcliffe, a hardworking Oxford law graduate who became part-editor and owner of The English Chronicle. He often came home late and in order to occupy her time, Radcliffe began to write, reading aloud the lines she had written during the day on his return.\'94\
\'93The Radcliffes\'92 marriage, though childless, appears to have been happy. In her Preface to A Journey made in the Summer of 1794 through Holland and the Western Frontiers of Germany (1795) Radcliffe touchingly referred to her husband as her \'91nearest relative and friend\'92 and acknowledged that the account of the journey had \'91been written so much from their mutual observation, that there would be a deception in permitting the book to appear, without some acknowledgement, which may distinguish it from works entirely her own\'92. The couple loved travelling together and used some of the money made from the publication of Radcliffe\'92s novels to finance their trips.\'94}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 In the next section I will close-read the implicit models underlying each database, to examine how each enforces a particular concept of \'93literature\'94 and \'93a text.\'94 However, before these models can make sense, we must understand the history of how they were built. I contend that each database is best understood as a negotiation between the noncommercial values of textual reproduction and [capitalism]. Each database has the goal of making valuable information available. After the 1990s, they are particularly influenced by the utopian ideal that digital reproduction at last made textual reproduction free. Each had to contend, however, with the fact that before a text can be reproduced digitally it must be 
\i created
\i0  digitally, and that even if the material costs are entirely eliminated (which, of course, they are not) textual creation continues to have costs in labour.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 I contend that each database is best understood as a negotiation between the noncommercial values of textual reproduction and [capitalism]. Each database has the goal of making valuable information available. After the 1990s, they are particularly influenced by the utopian ideal that digital reproduction at last made textual reproduction free.

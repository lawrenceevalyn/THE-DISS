My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. \cf3 As this chapter will establish, \cf2 I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, \cf3 this chapter\cf2  will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker\'92s vocabulary of \'93capta,\'94 rather than \'93data,\'94 to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally \'93given.\'94 I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty.\cf4  \cf5 Defining the scope of my material\cf3 , in addition to establishing my technological frameworks, also allows me to answer key questions about my chosen subject matter.\cf5  \cf4 Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, t\cf5 his chapter will set out the constraints I have set in my inquiry \'97 material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive) \'97 and discuss this \cf4 eleven-year \'93\cf5 decade\cf4 \'94\cf5 .\cf4  \cf3 The choice of the 1790s \cf4 implicitly\cf3  supports an interest in the Gothic and in women\'92s writing\cf6 ; although I seek to avoid begging the question by posing my questions explicitly about the Gothic and female writers, \cf3 I do anticipate that \cf6 attention to this decade\cf3  will reveal their prominence.\cf6  More explicitly central to my choice of the 1790s is the importance of this decade as\cf2  a literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form.\cf3  When the eighteenth century [literary world? Who does this?] begins to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the \'93archive\'94 of literary history begins to be interpreted into \'93canons\'94 of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. [Therefore, [this chapter will do something about] questions about archives and canons.] Having chosen the 1790s generally, t\cf5 he specific years are chosen to capture the major events of the French Revolution\cf3 , reflecting an interest in politics.

\i0 \cf5 I am interested in politics as something that occurs between people rather than between parties; interested in \'91schools of thought\'92 and the complex individuality of those schools.)\cf3  - Political affiliation, like literary genre, is not a matter of simple taxonomic classification. Therefore, this chapter will [X].}

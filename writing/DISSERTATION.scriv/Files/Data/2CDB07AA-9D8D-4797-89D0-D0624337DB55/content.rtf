\f0\fs22 \cf0 My first chapter sets out the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will discuss, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are seeking to develop less \'93extractive\'94 and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker\'92s vocabulary of \'93capta,\'94 rather than \'93data,\'94 to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally \'93given.\'94 I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project \'97 material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this this eleven-year \'93decade\'94 to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s will highlight a decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://906366F5-77AB-4A8B-BBE1-283C8E7065D2"}}{\fldrslt writers.}} Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the \'93archive\'94 of literary history was filtered into \'93canons\'94 of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.}

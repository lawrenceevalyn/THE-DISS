\f0\fs22 \cf0 My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will establish, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan \cf2 and Jasmine Rault \cf0 in \cf2 understanding my research as a kind of\cf0  reparative work on archives. \cf2 I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are seeking to develop less \'93extractive\'94 and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies\cf0 . \cf2 My first\cf0  chapter will present a humanistic critique of \cf2 the \cf0 essentialist tendencies \cf2 of some work in the field of DH\cf0 , and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker\'92s vocabulary of \'93capta,\'94 rather than \'93data,\'94 to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally \'93given.\'94 I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will \cf3 also \cf0 set out the \cf3 limits to the project\cf0  \'97 material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive)\cf3 .\cf0  \cf3 I will describe the importance of my selection of this\cf0  this eleven-year \'93decade\'94\cf3  to test my methods\cf0 . A brief literature review of\cf3  the literary output of \cf0 the 1790s will highlight \cf3 decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://906366F5-77AB-4A8B-BBE1-283C8E7065D2"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 writer\cf0 s.}}\cf0  In that context, this chapter will describe my own understanding of eighteenth century politics as \'93schools of thought\'94 governed by memetic natural selection; because politics occurs between individual people, not political parties, political affiliation, like literary genre, is not amenable to simple taxonomic classification. Finally, this chapter will bring together \cf3 modern theories\cf0  of the archive and my eighteenth century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which \cf3 some significant\cf0  literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth century editors beg\cf3 a\cf0 n to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the \'93archive\'94 of literary history beg\cf3 an\cf0  to be interpreted into \'93canons\'94 of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. Th\cf3 e\cf0  divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.}

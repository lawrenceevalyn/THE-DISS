\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93The Cheap Repository has usually been discussed within the con- text of the turbulent politics of the 1790s and the resulting fears, on the part of the gentry and the aristocracy, of popular violence. Historians, from More's first biographer Henry Thompson to E. P. Thompson, have pointed to the publication of Painite pamphlets and the rioting of the 1790s as the catalyst of More's moralizing literature.8 J. L. and Barbara Hammond further identified More's writings as the ideological justification for the economic exploitation and formal political exclu- sion of the poor.9 Although some historians of the evangelical move- ment, Ford K. Brown in particular, have recognized that the tracts tried to reform the morals of the poor quite as much as their politics these writers have also stressed the loyalist content of the tracts, em- phasizing their attempt to give religious sanction to the existing socia order. 10\'94 (85)}

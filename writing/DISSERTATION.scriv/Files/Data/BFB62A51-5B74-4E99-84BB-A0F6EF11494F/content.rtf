\f0\fs22 \cf2 The existence of a carefully hand-corrected transcription of 
\i The Emigrants
\i0  in ECCO-TCP provides an opportunity to check the reliability of the OCR in both ECCO and HathiTrust. I will proceed from the assumption that the ECCO-TCP files are 100% accurate, and that any differences between the OCR and ECCO-TCP represents an OCR error. Before beginning the experiment, my hypothesis was that both ECCO and HathiTrust would differ from each other in where and how they are inaccurate, but would have similar accuracy overall. I suspected that they were likely around 50% accurate, plus or minus 10% \'97 I wouldn\'92t be surprised if they were worse, but would be quite surprised if their accuracy was 80% or higher{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://29B4B6D2-3F77-4753-9C67-712EF8B7433C"}}{\fldrslt .}}\cf3  Acquiring the plaintext files from all three sources required some hunting for some hidden options and some workarounds (described more fully in Appendix B), and the first glance was not very promising. Gale Digital Scholar Labs prominently provided an \'93OCR Confidence\'94 of 95%. To my surprise, Juxa calculated a relatively low \'93change index\'94 for each text compared to the TCP witness: ECCO had a .16 change from base (i.e., 84% accuracy), and HathiTrust a .29 change from base (i.e., 71% accuracy). Some of HathiTrust\'92s inaccuracy may come from the fact that it uses the \uc0\u383  character whereas TCP modernizes this to an s.}

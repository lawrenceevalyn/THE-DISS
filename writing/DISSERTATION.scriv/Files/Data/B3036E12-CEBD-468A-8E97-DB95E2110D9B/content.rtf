\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'93After their separation Benjamin went into hiding to escape further court proceedings, lived on the interest of his wife's fortune and left her to find means of supporting herself and their nine surviving children. Aware that once a final settlement of the will was brought about, the legacies due would have secured her children's futures, Smith exerted herself to earn sufficient money to pay for legal advice and maintain a genteel standard of living suitable to the expected inheritance. Circumstanced as she was, it is no surprise she described herself a \'93slave of the Booksellers\'94 (Smith to J. C. Walker, 9 October 1793). And so Smith churned out eleven novels, added to successive editions of the Elegiac Sonnets, produced two further volumes of poetry, and ended her career with the publication of four educational books for young people, a natural history of birds, and a history of England.\'94\cf2  (Blank n.pag.)}

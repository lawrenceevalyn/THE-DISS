\f0\fs22 \cf0 The disciplinary problem of literary studies is the desire/need for our work to speak to political or moral ends. Why does Piper see the methodological problems he does? Because setting out with a moral goal is a methodological problem. But I also think the need is real. I personally would never trust philosophy departments to guide our morals, ad it is not history\'92s job to do so; it seems that the peculiar role of art has really always been to explore How Should A Person Be? \'85 So one of the things perhaps to be more explicit about is where our historical/factual claims have turned into moral ones\

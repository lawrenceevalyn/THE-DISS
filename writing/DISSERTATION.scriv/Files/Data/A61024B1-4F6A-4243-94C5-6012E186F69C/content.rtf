\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93ProQuest is to be commended for its attitude to the wider scholarly community.27 EEBO is a commercial product but nonetheless there is an encouraging and genuine wish to engage with its users. This ranges from the active monitoring and rapid responding to queries submitted via its \'91Webmaster\'92 form to informal and formal consultations with students, scholars, and other users. EEBO representatives appear at \'96 and often sponsor \'96 academic events. Content is frequently corrected, updated, expanded and enhanced (such as the new \'91EEBO Introduction Series\'92); the searching mechanism continues to be improved; the project to produce full-text transcriptions (the Text Creation Partnership) is an academic venture, not a commercial one. Unlike Jackson\'92s microfilm photographer, lurking in his lair with his livid lights and chemical smells, the present providers of EEBO seem to be rather more interested in \'96 and responsive to \'96 contemporary scholarship.\'94 (Gadd 688)}

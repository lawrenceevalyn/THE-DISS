\f0\fs22 \cf0 The ESTC is not actually only one database: \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://045962CF-F612-47F1-8F1B-BAC56D01AA64"}}{\fldrslt The STAR file}}, maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. \'85 In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC\'92s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.\'94 (Tabor 373) There are two kinds of information, in particular, which the STAR file contains and which is concealed from ESTC users: the true \'91verified\'92 status of individual edition matches, and edition-specific notes on known errors.\
A \'93match\'94 in the ESTC is a known copy of a book held in a library which serves as a representative of a particular edition. A match can be encoded as \'93verified\'94 when an ESTC staff member consults the book to confirm that it corresponds to the edition in question, or \'93unverified\'94 when this has not happened. But the STAR copy contains two additional verification statuses: when a contributor such as a librarian or a scholar submits a match, it is coded as a \'93web match.\'94 \'93Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the \'91verified\'92 and \'91unverified\'92 levels\'94 (Tabor 374). Automated uploads of various outside databases can also generate new matches, encoded as \'93catalogue matches;\'94 these \'93have a comparatively low level of reliability\'94 (Tabor 374). However, in the transition from STAR to ESTC, \'93The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to \'91verified\'92. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt\'94 (374).\

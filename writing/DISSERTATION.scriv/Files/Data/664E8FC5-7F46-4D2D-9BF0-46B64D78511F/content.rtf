\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93Reflecting on Moretti\'92s work, David A. Brewer notes that flattening the literary field \'93nicely undoes the monumentalizing that so often accompanies the literary canon,\'94 but at the expense of ignoring the varied profiles and presences of works in history (162). Brewer focuses on commercial success, arguing that the popularity of different literary works at the time they are published and in subsequent generations accords them \'93a massively different footprint\'94 in history, altering their influence, and hence their meaning, for readers (163).\'94 (Bode 28)}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'93An increasingly common trend, I am sorry to report, is that more and more people do not want ESTC at all \'97 they want ECCO or EEBO. The younger generation of scholars in particular, lured by full-text images and ransacking the Web for illustrations for their books and articles, are using these utilities as de facto bibliographic databases. They find that the stripped-down records and simplified indexes are good enough for their purposes. To a minority of them, the fact that other works, editions, and copies exist outside the Web is irrelevant, and perhaps even irritating.\'94 (Tabor 368)}

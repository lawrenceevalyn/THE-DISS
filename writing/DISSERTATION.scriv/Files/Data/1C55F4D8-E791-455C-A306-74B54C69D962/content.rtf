\f0\fs22 \cf0 Poetry thus stands in a stark contrast to the volumes of writing which John Mee discusses in 
\i Print, Publicity, and Popular Radicalism in the 1790s. 
\i0 Although his title leaves open the possibility that he could consider any kind of writing in print, Mee is concerned solely with the activities of the London Corresponding Society, placed in the context of Romanticism. He examines \'93public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS\'92s name\'94 \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.28\}. These writers held a fundamentally different relationship to the print marketplace than the Romantic poets, or even than theatre critics: rather than concerning themselves with distinctions between \'91good\'92 and \'91bad\'92 forms of writing or publication, Mee argues, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A8331C93-39D3-4C02-B685-15394A687015"}}{\fldrslt \'93At certain points the societies seem to operate under the spell of \'91print magic\'92, that is, a faith that print could liberate mankind simply by bringing ideas into printed circulation\'94}} \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.24\}. This partly shifts to Mee himself the task of assessing whether the texts he studies are \'91literature.\'92 A partial claim to the status of \'91literature\'92 is suggested by the participation of his book within the series \'91Cambridge Studies in Romanticism,\'92 which, he acknowledges \'93implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of \'91literary\'92 culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies\'94 \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://4FFCC391-27FD-4AD3-A1AD-0E2A84C5557A"}}{\fldrslt 18}}\}. Nonetheless, the book distances itself from \'93Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights\'94 \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.18\}. Mee thus replicates the distance that the period\'92s \'93poets, novelists, and playwrights\'94 sought to put between themselves as the \'93the role of print {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://4AAD8AAD-3D3A-4736-AF13-F355F873D4A7"}}{\fldrslt personality}} as a form of mediation\'94 \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.29\} that interests Mee in the LCS.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 John Mee\cf2 :\cf0  
\i Print, Publicity, and Popular Radicalism in the 1790s. 
\i0 Although his title leaves open the possibility that he could consider any kind of writing in print, Mee is concerned solely with the activities of the London Corresponding Society, placed in the context of Romanticism. He examines \'93public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS\'92s name\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 28\cf2 )\cf0 .\cf2  Mee sidesteps the question of\cf0  whether the texts he studies are \'91literature.\'92 A partial claim to the status of \'91literature\'92 is suggested by the participation of his book within the series \'91Cambridge Studies in Romanticism,\'92 which, he acknowledges \'93implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of \'91literary\'92 culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies\'94 \cf2 ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://031B5C67-E5B0-422B-9840-055DEA1C14EC"}}{\fldrslt \cf0 18}})\cf0 . Nonetheless, the book distances itself from \'93Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights\'94 \cf2 (18). \cf0 Mee thus replicates \cf2 the way\cf0  that the period\'92s \cf2 definitely-literary \cf0 \'93poets, novelists, and playwrights\'94 sought to put \cf2 distance \cf0 between themselves a\cf2 nd\cf0  the\cf2  potentially sub-literary\cf0  \'93role of print {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E58AD667-EEFA-4AC0-9A35-93194566BE61"}}{\fldrslt personality}} as a form of mediation\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 29\cf2 )\cf0  that interests Mee in the LCS.}

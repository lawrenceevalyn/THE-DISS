\f0\fs22 \cf2 In 2004, there was some discussion of spinning off a PGII with the World eBook Library. \'93The co-founders say that PG 2 came from the need to include existing e-book collections, such as those found in schools, universities, and professional and religious organizations. Many such e-books do not fall into the acceptable criteria of Project Gutenberg. "For those books, PG 2 was created to find a home. PG 2 is a consortium of collections. Our vision is to create an additional portal where a broader variety of intellectual objects may be accessed.\'94\'94 (Hane)\

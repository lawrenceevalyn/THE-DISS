\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Although we talking about text mining projects as revealing information about \'93eighteenth century literature\'94 in fact they can only describe the corpus which is not \'93eighteenth century literature\'94 but in fact a model/sample.] [It is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus.] [If two scholars examine gendered authorship in the eighteenth century using ECCO-TCP and HathiTrust, and reach two opposing conclusions, can this be attributed to different sampling in their corpora?] I examine a very narrow selection of texts \'97 works published in England 1789-99 \'97 across a broad selection of corpora, to compare the resources generally used for studies of eighteenth century literature.}

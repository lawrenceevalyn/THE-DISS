\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'93overall, about how texts do or don't 'enter' a 'canon' of writings - by which you mean, as per e.g. Guillory or Bourdieu, and the idea of cultural capital, a set of texts studied, produced, valued (to varying degrees over time) within certain cultural fields, most especially the field of academic research (but also education, modern publishing, creative industries etc). And then your contribution to the many discussions that go on about (and indeed change) canon, is to bring show we can use digital tools to ask and answer that question? I think maybe it is, and if that is the case, then you need to say just that, and that the other issues - timelessness, popularity, marginalization, immediacy, fall out of that larger question\'94\

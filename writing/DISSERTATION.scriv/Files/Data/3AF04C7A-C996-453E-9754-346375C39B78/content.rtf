\f0\fs22 \cf2 Jos\'e9 M. Vaquero describes a different observer of the same 1794 that Goodall describes. Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos was a respectable \'93statesman, author, historian and philosopher\'94 in Spain (Vaquero n. pag.), to which Vaquero seeks to add evidence of his scientific activity. Vaquero is himself chiefly interested in the value of Jovellanos\'92s historic observational data in the contemporary study of stratospheric aerosol: Jovellanos\'92s description of the moon\'92s colour \'93indicates that the stratosphere around 1794 seems to have been undisturbed volcanically,\'94 as expected (Vaquero n. pag.).\
Jovellanos\'92s diary for February 14 1794 reads: "La noche clar\'edsima: ni una nube en el cielo; se vio perfectamente empezar, mediar y llenarse el eclipse de la Luna; en su plenitud tom\'f3 un color hierro encendido que era muy notable." [English translation: "Very clear night: not a cloud in the sky; the eclipse of the Moon was perfectly seen to begin, reach its midpoint, and fill; in its fullness it took on a fiery iron color that was very remarkable."] (Vaquero n. pag.) This sedate and factual account, which knows perfectly well that there is an eclipse and finds the event in itself unremarkable, seems to come from a different era from Goodall\'92s frantic account. Goodall, in fact, does not even use the word \'93eclipse,\'94 but describes the moon as \'93rocking\'94 and then as surrounded or occluded by a flying army.\
How widespread was scientific knowledge of eclipses? Certainly, Goodall illustrates that the more rational/enlightened approach could coexist with superstitious thinking. Am I falling into a high/low trap here with a rational vs populist binary?}

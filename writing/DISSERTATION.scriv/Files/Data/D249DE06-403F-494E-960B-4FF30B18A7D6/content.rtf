\f0\fs22 \cf2 The actual way that books enter Wikipedia is through the website Distributed Proofreaders. It operates a lot like LibriVox in the sense that a volunteer will \'91sponsor\'92 a particular book and take responsibility for coordinating other volunteers and shepherding it through the proofreading process. Generally they will physically acquire a pre-1921 book, scan, and OCR it. Proofreaders will then check a few pages at a time to correct OCR errors.\

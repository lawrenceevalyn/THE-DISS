\f0\fs22 \cf0 Despite the fact that Cronin\'92s chief interest is in each poet\'92s use of language to construct an ideal audience, print culture looms. Of Erasmus Darwin, Cronin emphasizes Darwin\'92s use of \'93[t]he most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status,\'94 namely, \'93the language of science\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 16\cf2 )\cf0 , but it is the \'93beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 29\cf2 )\cf0  which asserts his importance. Blake\'92s eccentric, idiosyncratic language is mirrored in his eccentric, idiosyncratic printing practices \cf2 (\cf0 60\cf2 )\cf0 . Southey and Landor\'92s universal, international language seeks to \'93escape from history\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 81\cf2 )\cf0 , which entails disavowing not only the popular prose fictions which sought to represent history but also the very circulating libraries in which they were distributed \cf2 (\cf0 74\cf2 )\cf0 . In other words, Cronin, even more so than Bainbridge, seems to use \'91poetic language\'92 to explain phenomena which have important print culture dimensions.}

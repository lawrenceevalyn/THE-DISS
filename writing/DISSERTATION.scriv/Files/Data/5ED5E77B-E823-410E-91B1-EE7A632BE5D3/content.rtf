\f0\fs22 \cf2 Bode\'92s article \'93The Equivalence of \'91Close\'92 and \'91Distant\'92 Reading\'94 sets out to explain how distant reading, as a particularly headline-grabbing subset of DH, became so firmly associated, especially in the minds of its critics, with \'93the view of distant reading as enabling direct and objective access to a comprehensive literary-historical record.\'94 (78) Bode contends that the exaggerated vision of distant readers who finally discover literary truths without getting bogged down by the pesky details of actual books \'97 oracles who deliver scientific objectivity to rescue literature from its messiness \'97 is not a vision wholly fabricated by media outlets and naysayers, but one fostered by the most prominent distant readers\'92 unacknowledged New Critical roots. \cb3 [TODO-WRITE: summarize Bode\'92s article]\cb1  What Bode reveals, then, is that the monolithic concept of \'93data\'94 can (as Drucker says) \'93[collapse] the critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation\'94 (1) with seductive ease regardless of whether visualization has been involved.}

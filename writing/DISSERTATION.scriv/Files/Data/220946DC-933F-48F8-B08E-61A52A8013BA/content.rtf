\f0\fs30 \cf0 My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the existing digital archives of the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade, with some discussion of celebrity as it manifests in print culture. Chapter four turns its attention to the radical press, and the social ties underlying radical writing and publishing. A potential fifth chapter could explore the penetration of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode; I would be interested to see what percentage of works during the decade can be said to contain Gothic materials.}

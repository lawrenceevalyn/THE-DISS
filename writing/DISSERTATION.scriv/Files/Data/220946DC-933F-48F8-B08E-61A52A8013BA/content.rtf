\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 My introduction establishes the vocabularies that I will use. Chapter one engages with a digital humanities problem, to ask how existing corpora of eighteenth century literature (mis)represent the 1790s, establishing a foundation of knowledge for the following chapters. Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author\'92s place in a canon, particularly for male versus female authors. Another argument I hope to advance is that literary works can be considered relevant to a given literary period, even after their original publication; my third chapter turns its attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered as important \'931790s literature\'94 due to successive re-printings during that decade. My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on another set of widely-read works that are sometimes excluded from the category \'931790s literature\'94: chapbooks. My fifth chapter brings together these lines of thought, to ask what relationship \'93serious literature\'94 had to the \'93non-literary\'94, and especially to \'93sub-literary\'94 fiction, in the 1790s.}

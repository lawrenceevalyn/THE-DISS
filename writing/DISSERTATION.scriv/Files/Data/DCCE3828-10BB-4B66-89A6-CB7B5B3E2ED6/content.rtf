\f0\fs22 \cf2 Chapter five returns to the small scale of close-reading and my four authors. Looking again at their publications, and contextualized by my findings about the decade as a whole, I analyze each author\'92s place within the eighteenth century print marketplace. I explore their posthumous reception. And, finally, I present my own reading of how to remember, study, and teach their 1790s works.}

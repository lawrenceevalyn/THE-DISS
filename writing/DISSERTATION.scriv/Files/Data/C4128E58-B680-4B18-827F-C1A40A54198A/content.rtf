\f0\fs22 \cf0 this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the \'93archive\'94 of literary history \cb2 began to be interpreted into\cb1  \'93canons\'94 of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 The columns are: \'93Type of resource\'94 (\'93Monograph\'94 or \'93Serial\'94); \'93ESTC citation number\'94; \'93Name\'94 (e.g., of an author, editor or illustrator); \'93Dates associated with name\'94 (generally, the years they lived); \'93Type of name\'94 (\'93meeting/conference,\'94 \'93organization,\'94 or \'93person\'94); \'93Role\'94 (e.g., \'93author,\'94 \'93cartographer,\'94 or \'93bookseller\'94), \'93All names\'94, \'93Title\'94, \'93Variant titles\'94, \'93Place of publication\'94, \'93Publisher\'94, \'93Date of publication\'94 (a single year), \'93Date of publication (not standardised)\'94 (e.g., a year in roman numerals, or a date which includes a month or day), and \'93Publication date range\'94 (for serials). In other words, it includes the very basic information of author, title, publisher, and year, in a complex structure which belies the apparent simplicity of these \'93basics.\'94 Some of the ESTC records included in this corpus do not necessarily match my selection criteria (England, 1789-99), which is inevitably true of every corpus collected, and which I discuss in more detail in SECTION, Data Cleaning.}

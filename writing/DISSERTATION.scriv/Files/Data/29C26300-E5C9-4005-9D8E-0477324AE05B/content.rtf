\f0\fs22 \cf2 To navigate the 1790s, I return to four \'91key\'92 authors whose careers and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature and writers. These authors are Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Ann Radcliffe. All four authors were highly productive in the 1790s, and all four had complex and contested literary legacies after the 1790s. In the following chapters of this dissertation, I will ask whether and how contemporary digital archives make these authors visible. First, however, I will provide a brief overview of each author\'92s major works, general biography, and critical reception.}

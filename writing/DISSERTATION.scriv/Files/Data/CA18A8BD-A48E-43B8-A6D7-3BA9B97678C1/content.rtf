\f0\fs30 \cf0 The final chapter would, in some fashion, draw together my overarching concern with print culture as a social activity. I will resist the impulse to discuss to take the Gothic as my main subject or the driving framework for an experiment (though I expect that the social nature of print will nonetheless include discussion of the Gothic). I think instead I might get at the two meanings of \'93popular\'94, that is, \'93pop culture\'94 (mainstream) and \'93populist\'94 (radical).}

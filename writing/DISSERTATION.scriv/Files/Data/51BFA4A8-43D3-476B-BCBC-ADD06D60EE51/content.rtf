\f0\fs30 \cf0 Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strageically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald\'92s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published\'85. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. \'97\'97 And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?}

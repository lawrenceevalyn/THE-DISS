\f0\fs22 \cf2 Because the texts are available without restrictions, a number of [spin-off] websites exist, some of which extend PG\'92s mission and some of which are slightly exploitative. On the most purely beneficial side are website \'93mirrors,\'94 which duplicate the contents of the website in order to distribute the costs of hosting and to make sure that the texts remain accessible even if the \'93primary\'94 Project Gutenberg website goes down. Also in keeping with Project Gutenberg\'92s core mission are projects which take the very plain text of PG works and make them more appealing or accessible in different formats. LibriVox, for example, is a similarly volunteer-driven effort which produces audiobooks of public domain works. Many organizations produce polished ebooks of PG works, and offer them for sale or for free in individual ebook reader libraries such as the Apple iBooks store or the Kindle store.\
\'93In 2004 Project Gutenberg Europe and Distributed Proofreaders Europe were formed to facilitate the process of adding more non-English works.\'94 (Hosch)}

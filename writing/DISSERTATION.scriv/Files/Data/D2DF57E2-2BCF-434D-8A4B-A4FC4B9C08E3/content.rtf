\f0\fs22 \cf0 Implicit in my prioritization of reparative reading is an affinity for queer theory more broadly. I take it as read, for example, that history consists of major discontinuities in cultural ontology and identity, as Foucault describes. I follow Judith Butler in understanding these historically-framed identities as being \'93performative,\'94 actively re-created in conversation between self and others. (In my understanding of performative identity creation I also borrow from J.L. Austin, who is not typically understood as a \'91queer theorist,\'92 but who contributes valuable vocabulary for how words do things.)}

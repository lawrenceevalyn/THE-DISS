\f0\fs22 \cf0 To navigate the 1790s, I turn to \cf2 an\cf0  author whose careers and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature\cf2 : Charlotte Smith\cf0 .\cf2  Smith was\cf0  highly productive in \cf2 multiple genres throughout \cf0 the 1790s, and had \cf2 a \cf0 complex and contested literary legac\cf2 y\cf0  after the 1790s. As literary scholars re-assess ideas about literary seriousness, popularity, and women\'92s writing, our assessment of \cf2 Smith\cf0  has shifted as well. By examining their bibliographies with computational methods, I again ask how \cf2 she\cf0  might \cf2 continue to \cf0 look different if we look at \cf2 her\cf0  a different way.\cf2  I particularly examine the extent to which digital resources have kept up with the re-evaluation of Smith as a central figure in British Romanticism.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 To navigate the 1790s, I turn to four authors whose careers and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature. These authors are Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Ann Radcliffe. All four authors were highly productive in the 1790s, and all four had complex and contested literary legacies after the 1790s. As literary scholars re-assess ideas about literary seriousness, popularity, and women\'92s writing, our assessment of these authors has shifted as well. By examining their bibliographies with computational methods, I again ask how they might look different if we look at them a different way. In the following chapters of this dissertation, I will ask whether and how contemporary digital archives make these authors visible. To introduce each of those chapters, I provide here a brief overview of each author\'92s major works, general biography, and critical reception.}

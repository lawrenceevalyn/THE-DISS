\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93Chapter 5, \'93Fictional Systems: Network Analysis and Syndication Networks,\'94 investigates fiction reprinting to explore the ways in which colonial literary culture both intersected with and was distinct from the global circulation of fiction in the nineteenth century. \'85 I show that Tillotson\'92s was only one entity among many operating in Australia, that it became systematically involved with colonial newspapers a decade earlier, and by a different motivation, than has been argued, and that the involvement of colonial newspapers in publishing local writing, and in sourcing and distributing fiction, continued despite the presence of multiple international companies in the market.\
Turning to provincial newspapers, I demonstrate that fiction reprinting, as well as publishing, was more common in that context than in the metropolitan one. \'85 While past histories of Australian publishing are primarily book-based, this investigation shows that a local newspaper syndication agency, Cameron, Laing, and Co., published the most Australian fiction for the nineteenth century and probably well into the twentieth. It also reveals that provincial syndicates provided more fiction to the colonies than any of the book publishers, local or global, or the metropolitan newspapers that have been the focus of previous literary and book histories.\'94 (11)}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 My research uses new computational tools to revisit longstanding questions about literary canonical formation, and examines the new questions raised by [corpora as the new canons].\
Despite the crucial importance of corpus-building (that is, the accumulation of a large body of text files for analysis) to the interpretation of \'93distant reading\'94 research, it is often extremely difficult to know what is in a corpus. Even large institutional resources used by many scholars provide little context for their choices of what to include or exclude. These hidden choices are particularly problematic when historical selection factors might have led to the creation of databases which re-create social inequalities. I focus specifically on writing printed in England between 1789 and 1799, to explore how works from this eleven-year \'93decade\'94 have been selected as important, literary, or popular. The late eighteenth century is a thematically resonant moment for the questions I ask: \cb3 [LOTS OF PRODUCTION, PEOPLE TRYING TO SELECT.]\cb1  For this period, the English Short Title Catalogue provides basic bibliographic data for nearly 52,000 titles, but the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus of XML-encoded full texts \'97 the source for most distant reading research on eighteenth century literature \'97 includes fewer than 500 titles. This difference raises the question: why were the other 51,500 titles not considered worth the investment of scholarly effort? And with particular urgency: do the most invested-in resources underrepresent women? \
My experiments examine six major databases to answer these questions: The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and HathiTrust. For each database, I calculate how many works printed in England 1789-1799 are attributed to male, female, or unknown authors, and compare the representation of broad categories of writing like poetry, drama, prose fiction, sermons, non-fiction, and ephemera. Identifying these categories of writing within each database reveals a predictable preference for \'93literary\'94 forms such as novels and poetry (rather than non-fiction or sermons) in the smaller databases. This preference for particular kinds of writing might explain changes in gender representation. If novels are mostly written by women, for example, a corpus can underrepresent women by under-representing novels. Or it could include a representative number of novels, but disproportionately include novels by men. My investigation allows me to identify the patterns of selection.\
This \'93case study\'94 of a particular decade [allows me to do something something about how collections of texts implicitly create identity-based collectives]}

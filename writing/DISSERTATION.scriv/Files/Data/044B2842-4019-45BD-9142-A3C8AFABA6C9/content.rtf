\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93Selection of works to transcribe for EEBO Phase 1 was initially based on named authors mentioned in the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature.  Though this tended to bias selection a bit toward canonical, or at least attributed, works, anonymous works may also have been selected at this stage if their titles appeared in the bibliography. The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature was chosen as a guideline because it included foundational works as well as less canonical titles related to a wide variety of fields, not just literary studies. In any case, this initial reliance on the New Cambridge soon gave way to a series of deliberate attempts to cast a wider net, for example by selecting works exemplifying a particular theme (food, drugs, piracy, witchcraft), or fitting a particular format (broadsides, pamphlets, etc.)  The intention was to supplement methodical selection with more or less random selection based on arbitrary criteria in order to expand the generic diversity of the corpus. Requests for particular works by faculty at partner institutions were also taken into consideration and, if feasible, placed at the head of the queue. A user willing and able to make a case for a given work almost always prevailed over other considerations.\'94 (TCP \'93EEBO\'94)}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93It is perhaps the inconsistency of the OCR readings, obvious from this rough assessment, that makes Gale bashful about the restricted files. The editors of the ESTC confess to their public resource being a construction site in a way that the proprietors of private, commercial websites like ECCO prefer not to. But few really mind these days, especially if improvements are seen to be ongoing. Gale should be more relaxed about the incompleteness of their work, though perhaps not quite so relaxed as they are with the Burney Collection.\'94 (Bullard 756)}

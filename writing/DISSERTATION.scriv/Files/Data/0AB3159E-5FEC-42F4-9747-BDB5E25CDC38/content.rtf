\f0\fs30 \cf0 My fourth chapter pursues a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from \'931790s literature\'94: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being \'93literature\'94 rather than not being \'931790s\'94 (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how \'91out of date\'92 chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a \'93gap\'94 in William St. Clair\'92s history, to see how much we do know about the chapbook trade. I am particularly interested in the cycle of responses between pamphlets, and whether there are geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness. This chapter will of course address Hannah More\'92s Cheap Repository Tracts, but I am equally curious about the works among which hers were sold. My \'93case study\'94 could trace the printing and circulation of one of More\'92s pamphlets and a few of its fellow-travellers, as the foundation for a discussion of More\'92s hybrid literary forms. }

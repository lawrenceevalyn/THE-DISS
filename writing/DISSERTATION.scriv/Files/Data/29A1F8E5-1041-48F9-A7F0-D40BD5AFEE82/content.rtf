\f0\fs22 \cf2 For examples of literary practices which move away from paranoia, I draw upon the work of Rita Felski, and the theories of \'93surface reading\'94 described by Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, and Heather Love. \cf0 Felski, in her article \'93After Suspicion\'94 and then further in her monograph 
\i The Limits of Critique
\i0 , \cf2 seeks to\cf0  attend seriously to literary attachments, including our own attachments as critics. Felski\'92s approach to these attachments is essentially sociological, drawing heavily on Bruno Latour\'92s actor-network-theory, and thus involves almost no close reading.\cf2  \cf0 \'93Surface reading\'94 positions itself as an alternative to \'93symptomatic reading\'94; rather than seeking to expose hidden truths concealed within texts, it attempts accurate descriptions that \'93make visible what is invisible only because it's too much on the surface of things\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 Best\cf2  \cf0 13\cf2 )\cf0 . The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but not perfect: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://0977C0DE-D6DA-43BF-975D-159F2F065096"}}{\fldrslt all paranoid reading is symptomatic, but not all symptomatic reading is paranoid}}. Reparative reading, as described by Sedgwick, is often still interested in \'91deep\'92 meanings of texts, in which striking textual features can be interpreted to locate additional meanings\cf2 . Felski\'92s readings are often symptomatic in this way. \cf0 In contrast, \'93surface reading,\'94 as Heather Love describes, pursues \'93a turn away from the singularity and richness of individual texts\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 374\cf2 )\cf0 , seeking descriptions \cf2 that \cf0 are \'93complex and variegated, but not rich, warm, or deep\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 378\cf2 )\cf0 . Love\'92s disavowal of \'93richness\'94 here is part of her attempt to move away from \'93the ethical charisma of the literary translator or messenger\'94 \cf2 (\cf0 374\cf2 )\cf0  who characterizes the paranoid, critical figure that both Sedgwick and Felski also seek to escape.}

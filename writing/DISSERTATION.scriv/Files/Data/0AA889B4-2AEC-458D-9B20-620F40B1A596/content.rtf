\f0\fs22 \cf0 Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. I will examine individual works and individual authors,  Influenced by Lesser and Farmer\'92s articulation of \'93structures of popularity,\'94 I will consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://FCE9B696-E6B6-4B6F-96F2-21F7084939E0"}}{\fldrslt share.}} After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer\'92s challenge to account for the increased \'93footprint\'94 of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important \'931790s literature\'94 due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry\'92s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as "popular literature\'94.}

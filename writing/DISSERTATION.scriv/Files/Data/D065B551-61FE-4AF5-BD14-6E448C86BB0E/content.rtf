\f0\fs22 \cf0 According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this inflammatory claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny. In fact, by the metric of \'91unique entries in the ESTC database,\'92 the most popular author of the decade is by far Great Britain, followed by Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain, and King George {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3E1AA4EA-AE5E-4F4E-8FEE-0517F565F6E4"}}{\fldrslt III.}} Paine, More, Wesley and Shakespeare are only able to rise to our notice if we \cf2 intervene in the dataset to \cf0 filter out all authors whose names contain the phrase \'93Great Britain\'94; otherwise, Shakespeare is outnumbered by the House of Lords and by the Church of England.\cf2  These claims demonstrate that a poorly-formed question will produce a useless and stupid answer even (or perhaps especially) if computation is used to answer it. This dissertation is dedicated to the formulation of better questions. [It\'92s not possible to read, or to teach, everything.] [What do we choose from the 1790s to preserve, study, and teach?] [How do we choose?] [In this regard, my main question is about the use and formation of literary \'91canons,\'92 particularly our current canons.]}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this inflammatory claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny. In fact, by the metric of \'91unique entries in the ESTC database,\'92 the most popular author of the decade is by far Great Britain, followed by Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain, and King George {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3E1AA4EA-AE5E-4F4E-8FEE-0517F565F6E4"}}{\fldrslt III.}} Paine, More, Wesley and Shakespeare are only able to rise to our notice if we filter out all authors whose names contain the phrase \'93Great Britain\'94; otherwise, Shakespeare is outnumbered by the House of Lords and by the Church of England. That is to say, if we equate popularity and importance with quantity of unique publications, we [end up with garbage.]\

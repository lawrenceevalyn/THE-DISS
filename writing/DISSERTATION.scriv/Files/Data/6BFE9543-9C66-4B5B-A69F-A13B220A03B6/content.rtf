\f0\fs22 \cf0 Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scope. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. On the tip of anyone\'92s tongue, of course, is Gale\'92s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), containing over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which 51,965 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 in the decade titles appear in the ESTC but not ECCO). The ESTC does not provide access to texts themselves: instead, it is an authoritative bibliographic catalogue, available as a searchable database. It is ECCO which provides texts themselves: ECCO\'92s 180,000 titles works are available as photographed facsimiles of the full text of each title. The facsimiles can be searched within ECCO\'92s online interface; these searches examine a plaintext version of the facsimile pages that was generated by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but this OCR text is not made directly available. As a result, the facsimiles may be read individually by scholars, but cannot form the basis for computational corpus analysis. A subset of ECCO\'92s texts have been hand-prepared, as part of the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), to be easier to use in computational research. The resulting corpus of ECCO-TCP texts contains 2,231 titles, of which 466 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. These titles are available as carefully-edited texts encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard, which not only provides an accurate version of the text\'92s words, but encodes substantial details regarding its context on the page. Most large-scale distant reading of eighteenth century literature relies in the ECCO-TCP corpus as its \'91model\'92 or \'91sample\'92 to represent the period. Accordingly, one of the tasks of this dissertation is to precisely examine the makeup of thus corpus, and how it differs both from other corpora and from print culture in the period itself. These three digital collections \'97 ECCO, ESTC, and ECCO-TCP \'97 are the primary digital resources for the period, which form the basis of most . \cb2 [There are also two other kinds of digital archives: voracious mega-archives, and specialized micro-archives.]}

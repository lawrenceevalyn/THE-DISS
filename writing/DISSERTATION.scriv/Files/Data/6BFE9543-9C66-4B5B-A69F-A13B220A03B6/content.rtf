\f0\fs22 \cf0 The first three databases I examine will be no surprise to eighteenth century scholars: ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP. Gale\'92s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), contains over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which \cb2 42,000\cb1  were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which \cb2 51,965\cb1  were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 titles in the decade appear in the ESTC but not ECCO). The ESTC does not provide access to texts themselves: instead, it is an authoritative bibliographic catalogue, available as a searchable database. It is ECCO which provides texts: ECCO\'92s 180,000 titles works are available as photographed facsimiles of the full text of each title. The facsimiles can be searched within ECCO\'92s online interface; these searches examine a plaintext version of the facsimile pages that was generated by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but this OCR text is not made directly available. As a result, the facsimiles may be read individually by scholars, but cannot form the basis for computational corpus analysis. A subset of ECCO\'92s texts have been hand-prepared, as part of the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), to be easier to use in computational research. The resulting corpus of ECCO-TCP texts contains 2,231 titles, of which 466 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. These titles are available as carefully-edited texts encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard, which not only provides an accurate version of the text\'92s words, but encodes substantial details regarding its context on the page. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://0F16EFF9-6395-4223-BBF5-9BCBFCC77470"}}{\fldrslt Most large-scale distant reading of eighteenth century literature relies on the ECCO-TCP corpus as its \'91model\'92 or \'91sample\'92 to represent the period}}. Accordingly, one of the tasks of this dissertation is to examine the makeup of this corpus, and how it differs both from other corpora and from print culture in the period itself. These three digital collections \'97 ECCO, ESTC, and ECCO-TCP \'97 are the primary digital resources for the period, which form the basis of most digital research. However, they represent only one approach toward the collection and presentation of digital texts, to which there are two broad kinds of alternatives. These large but meticulous collections occupy a middle space between, on the one hand, highly selective thematic collections, such as The Shelley-Godwin Archive, of which there are many, and the giants of indiscriminate textual accumulation, such as Google Books, of which there are few.}

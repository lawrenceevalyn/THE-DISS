\f0\fs22 \cf0 The first phase of this project takes up titles and databases. Throughout this work, a \'91title\'92 is the broadest possible umbrella term for a text: it is synonymous with \'91a database entry which I believe to represent a printed work.\'92 Each individual database will shape the precise correspondences between a \'91title\'92 and the printed texts about which I use \'91titles\'92 to reason. For example, it will vary based on my source whether multiple editions of the same work are several \'91titles\'92 or one \'91title,\'92 and whether the titles exclusively represent \'91books\'92 or also include chapbooks, broadsheets, or even ephemera. Due to the inscrutability of digital infrastructure discussed above, it is often not possible for me to know prior to experimentation what kinds of titles I am working with. Chapter two, therefore, two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized.\

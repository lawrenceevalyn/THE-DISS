\f0\fs22 \cf0 - when I choose proxies, it's no longer so random; discuss the ways that my subsequent choices reduce randomness\
- a section where I just generate some more random lists, to see what randomness can produce -- is my sample an outlier or typical?\
- unpack that even randomness is not without randomness: demonstrating the way the human mind produces bias & cherrypicking; we can't get rid of the habit of pattern-making, the best we can do is not let the pattern come to us as something true. the canon isn't a thing, it's a pattern someone else came up\
- truth is not guaranteed to be a good story; danger of eg parler is a preference for strong narratives. get to what "critical reading" is-- is this selling something? how is this embedded in structures of power? then... how do we seek what is true?}

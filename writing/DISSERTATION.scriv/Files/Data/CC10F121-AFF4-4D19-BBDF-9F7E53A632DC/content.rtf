\f0\fs22 \cf0 The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)\
\
What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.\
A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.}

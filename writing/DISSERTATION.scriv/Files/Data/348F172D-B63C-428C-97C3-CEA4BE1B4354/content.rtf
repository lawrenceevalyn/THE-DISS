\f0\fs22 \cf0 Chapter four introduces my mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. My understanding and use of network analysis is contextualized in light of Wendy Chun\'92s work on networks in \'93Queerying Homophily\'94 \\cite\{Chun:2018tq\}. I describe my methodology and its assumptions, and provide a rich description of my resulting network {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E6E0D11B-CCCB-4AF5-8974-228B09952914"}}{\fldrslt graph}}. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the \'93major players\'94 in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.}

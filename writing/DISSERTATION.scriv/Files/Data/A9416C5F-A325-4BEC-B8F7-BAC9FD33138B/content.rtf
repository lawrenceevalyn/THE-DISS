\f0\fs22 \cf0 Drawing together three scholarly conversations with three distinct histories, it is difficult to attentively delineate the links and the tensions between each thread. Especially since many of these fields have, in fact, overlapped substantially, there is a danger of simplistically conflating distinct lines of thoughts. At the same time, over-emphasis on distinctions can overstate the separations between fields which do in fact (as the existence of this dissertation contents) share important affinities. To navigate these conceptual overlaps carefully, let us make our way through each area of an imagined Venn diagram of the three. We can discuss each pair in turn \'97 DH and eighteenth century studies; eighteenth century studies and queer theory; queer theory and DH \'97 to make our way toward the centre where all three overlap.}

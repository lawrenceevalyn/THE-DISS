\f0\fs22 \cf0 Chapter three does for Robinson the same initial process that chapter two did for Smith: I assemble, from a range of scholarly resources, an authoritative list of Robinson\'92s publications, and seek them in each of the six databases. My initial hypothesis is that, due to Robinson\'92s different posthumous reception, proportionally fewer of her works will be included in smaller archives compared to Charlotte Smith. In addition to comparing Robinson\'92s inclusion to Smith\'92s, I will use Robinson to explore the structural makeup of my databases, examining their representation of \'93authorship\'94 the way I used Smith\'92s 
\i Elegiac Sonnets
\i0  to examine their representation of \'93editions.\'94 Robinson frequently wrote under pseudonyms or left works unsigned: how do the databases I examine handle authorship attribution? Discussing the digital encoding of Robinson\'92s authorship raises the subject of authorship more generally, as a flexible concept which can resist strict {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://50F56D43-41A4-4C3A-A05A-ABA7E6518CE2"}}{\fldrslt encoding.}} In particular, it draws attention to the importance of unsigned works, as distinct from anonymous works, and \'93open secrets\'94 of authorship. As with Smith, I close the chapter with a consideration of Robinson herself as an author.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 I could end by describing what Bode-like scholarly edition I\'92d like to make. What would it be?\
Datasets of men\'92s, women\'92s, and unsigned writing from the 1790s? Filtering to fiction, or poetry? Or sermons?? Non-literary writing? Things that people might want to teach?\
Circulating libraries? Maybe one specific library, to be feasible?\
Reprints??}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 Reparative Algorithm Studies\cf3 \
TODO: make this more honest, so I can trust their decision \'97 try to articulate an argument\cf2 \

My work takes a critical algorithm studies approach to digital databases of eighteenth century literature, examining the holdings and structural assumptions of the most-used resources (including some that scholars don\'92t like to admit to using). My initial research question was, by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick\'92s definition, a classically paranoid approach: I sought to expose the under-representation of women\'92s writing underlying apparently \'93neutral\'94 digital tools. This question carried the combined urgency and futility of paranoid critique: urgent, because an unfair database would expose an unfair society; and futile, since the research could only be motivated by the conviction that its answer was already known. My paper will touch on some specifics of this research and my findings, as the basis for a broader discussion of critical algorithm studies, and the project of imagining reparative algorithm studies. I begin with Kath Bode\'92s recent correctives to the field of distant reading, and early distant readers\'92 disdain for the particularities of textual scholarship. I then draw on queer theorists, especially Sedgwick, to discuss the messy intimacies of algorithm studies. One of the current problems of critical algorithm studies is how difficult it is to move from critique to action: it seems that no matter how carefully we dissect the flaws of oppressive computational systems, we cannot opt out of them.

\f0\fs22 \cf0 \'93The English Short-Title Catalog (ESTC) is a vast database designed to include a bibliographic record, with holdings, of every surviving copy of letterpress produced in Great Britain or any of its dependencies, in any language, worldwide, from 1473-1800\'94 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://214E6907-A61B-43F1-8573-35D597298A1F"}}{\fldrslt (CBSR)}}. Today, \'93The English Short-Title Catalogue is the most comprehensive record of what has appeared in print in Britain and the English-speaking world for all branches of human experience from the last quarter of the fifteenth century to the start of the nineteenth. More specialized studies exist for fields and eras within that span, but no other resource matches ESTC\'92s dependability over such a broad range\'94 (Vander Meulen 265).}

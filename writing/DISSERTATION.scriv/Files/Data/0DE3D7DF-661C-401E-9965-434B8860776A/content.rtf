\'93Although "Eighteenth Century Collections Online, Part 2 adds six million pages that include previously unavailable or inaccessible titles," the latest promotional leaflet claims a total of "26 million pages of text" for ECCO - instead of 32 million - which is the same total that appeared in the original promotional leaflet for what is now understood to be ECCO Part 1.

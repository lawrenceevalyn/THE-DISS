\f0\fs22 \cf0 I am by no means the first to examine the writing of the 1790s in light of authors\'92 political strategies in the print marketplace, though preceding work is often organized along genre lines. For example, George Taylor, in 
\i The French Revolution and the London Stage
\i0 , sets forth some key contentions about literature\'92s cultural capital. He argues that although eighteenth-century critics sought to make distinctions in the social value of different plays, or different parts of the theatrical program at a single show, audiences did not make these distinctions. \'93Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery,\'94 he argues, the division was purely physical: \'93all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all [\'85] all received plaudits from all corners of the house\'94 \\cite\{Taylor:2001gp p.3\}. Taylor proceeds to define the central concerns and strategies of the plays staged during this period, arguing that \'93the determining feature of the period for the theatre was the sense of loss, a feeling that things had changed in ways that people did not expect or want,\'94 a feeling that was reflected in \'93images of incarceration, dislocation and supernatural intervention\'94 \\cite\{Taylor:2001gp p.221\}. This analysis of the theatre is structured by his originating observation that \'93Disagreement as to what is trash and what is treasure suggests cultural crisis, when values are put under question by social stress or political conflict\'94 \\cite\{Taylor:2001gp p.3\}. The communal space of the theatre, which some attempt to render non-communal and to dissect class lines, is for Taylor fertile ground. For my inquiry, it is the \'93[d]isagreement as to what is trash and what it treasure\'94 itself which animates me: the terms \'93trash\'94 and \'93treasure\'94 are hardly exaggerations of the extremity of the conflicting assessments which could be passed regarding the same {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://26087BCC-148F-4626-B984-5CA87FD425FF"}}{\fldrslt works}}.}

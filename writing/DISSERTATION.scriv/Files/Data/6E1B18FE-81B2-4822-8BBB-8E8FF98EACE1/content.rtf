This is analogue-era scholarship, and concerning a period other than yours, but I think very relevant for some of your groundwork issues. On publishing statistics, DFM is very incisive about the difference between production rates and survival rates, and the tendency of scholars to talk about the first when really the only thing they see is the second. This isn't going to be such a big issue for the 1790s, but it's going to be an issue all the same. He's good on sheet counts and print runs too: the way a fugitive one-sheet broadside in two tiny editions can show up bibliometrically (in an ESTC count, say) as a bigger deal than, or more "popular" than, a fat heavyweight folio in a single edition with a big print run. }

\f0\fs22 \cf2 In my fourth chapter, I playfully attempt what might be considered a devil\'92s advocate method of textual selection: pure random sampling. Using a random number generator, I select arbitrary texts to close\cf3  \cf2 read\cf4 , and weave together a narrative of 1790s print from their contents\cf2 .\cf4  Much of my work will involve defining and justifying the parameters for my random selection \'97 ESTC, or a full-text database? How many texts? From which years? \'97 but once I have taken my sample, I will not re-sample. For each text, I explore the path which brought it into the databases in question, and what scholarship (if any) might be used to interpret it. How far afield do I have to look, to find scholarly conversations addressing each text? What, if anything, can be produced by placing them in conversation? This methodology is inspired by work in the field of speculative computing, a practice of creating strange and possibly non-functional programs in order to generate productive forms of surprise.}

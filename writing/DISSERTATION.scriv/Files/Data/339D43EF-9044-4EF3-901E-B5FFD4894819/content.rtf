\f0\fs22 \cf0 The central contention of my computational praxis is that, despite the aura of empirical truth which accrues to some \'91scientific\'92 methodologies and discourses, nothing is \cb2 neutral/objective\cb1 . As Johanna Drucker argues, \'93data\'94 is not \cb2 neutral/objective\cb1 . As Safiya Noble and Wendy Chun demonstrate, algorithms are not \cb2 neutral/objective\cb1 . As Alberto Cairo shows, graphs and charts are not \cb2 neutral/objective\cb1 . Each of these is constructed, by humans, for human purposes, constrained by human biases. As the humanities have long known, of course, things need not be \cb2 neutral/objective\cb1  to be meaningful or valuable. By setting aside the desire for a singular \cb2 neutral/objective\cb1  truth, we can instead draw quite close to the messy multitudes of truths which enable insight. Accordingly, \cb3 [CONCLUSION]\cb1 .}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 One of the major findings of this research methodology is a reminder that digital records are based on a relentless materiality. The method itself, in some ways, boils down to predicting the location of some barriers to research, and then smashing my face directly against those barriers in order to characterize their location, shape, and solidity. The hunt for the more-neglected titles hit very similar barriers. The Hayward advertisement has only one recorded copy, in Germany; elation when looking up the shelfmark reveals that it is bound with the Gentleman\'92s Magazine and I can find a HathiTrust scan of that exact volume; growing dread as a detailed examination of the 800-page facsimile makes it clear that the advertisement did not normally appear within the magazine but was bound with it separately by an idiosyncratic German person; resignation as I use Google Translate to compose an apologetic message in German for the Niedersachsische Staats und Universitatsbibliothek, where someone will have to go dig out the book and personally inspect it for the inclusion. Or, for the East India accounts \'97 growing elation as I realise that one of the holding libraries is UCLA, where material conditions are in my favour, since I have a friend studying there; hopes that are dashed by the absolute bar on special collections access during COVID-19.}

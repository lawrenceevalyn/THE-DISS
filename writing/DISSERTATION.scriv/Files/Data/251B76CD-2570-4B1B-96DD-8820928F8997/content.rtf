\f0\fs22 \cf2 The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus is not without grounds. As this dissertation will explore in depth, challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new \'93great unread.\'94 \cf0 Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to 
\i do
\i0  with texts.\cf2  For example, the English Short Title Catalogue records \cb3 [XXX]\cb1  titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799. The corpus most commonly used for DH work on eighteenth century literature, ECCO-TCP, includes only \cb3 XXX\cb1  titles for that same time period. What are the other \cb3 XXX\cb1  titles, why are they accessible in the ways they are, and what does it mean for digital eighteenth century studies that they are not included? In a series of computational and non-computational research processes, I examine \cb3 X\cb1  corpora of eighteenth century texts to learn about four eighteenth century authors, and I examine four eighteenth century authors to learn about eighteenth century corpora. T\cf0 his dissertation\cf2 , therefore,\cf0  takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the \cf2 major\cf0  \cf2 research\cf0  experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 In a series of computational and non-computational research processes, I examine 18thC corpora to learn about four 18thC authors, and I examine four 18thC authors to learn about 18thC corpora. T\cf0 his dissertation takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the \cf2 major\cf0  computational experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93Members of the Board also felt that TCP should complete an equity review of all of its employees to see what salaries are being offered from other universities and whether TCP\'92s salaries are in-line with what is being offered elsewhere. It was suggested that TCP might want to do a 10% raise across the board for all reviewing staff that remain with the project for five years.\'94 (TCP Executive Board, Meeting Minutes 2005-10-20) In the next year, \'93Mark also reported on one item from the previous Board meeting, salary reviews. Maria and Shawn investigated the possibilities of raising salaries for TCP reviewers within the University of Michigan, and compared salaries at Michigan and Oxford. It was found that the salaries of the reviewers were comparable with expectations. Paul also reported that the reviewers who left had reasons other than salary (family issues, better opportunities within their field of study, etc.). Therefore, it was decided not to raise all reviewers salaries at once, but to continue doing merit increases that the University of Michigan does every year.\'94 (TCP Executive Board, \'93Meeting Minutes 2006-09-16.\'94)}

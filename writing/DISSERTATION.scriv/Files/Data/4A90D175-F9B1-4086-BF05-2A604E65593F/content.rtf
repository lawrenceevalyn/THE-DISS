\f0\fs22 \cf2 In 2005 the TCP was thinking about themselves as competing with Google: \'93John Price-Wilkin, Associate University Librarian for Library Information Technology & Technical and Access Services, was a guest of the Board to talk about issues relating to the Google initiative and TCP\'92s role in promoting \'93enhanced\'94 product to the library and academic community.

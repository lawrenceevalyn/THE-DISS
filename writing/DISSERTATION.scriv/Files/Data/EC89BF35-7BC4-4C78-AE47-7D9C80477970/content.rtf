\f0\fs30 \cf0 Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author\'92s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers\'92 claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived \'93seriousness\'94 of their reputations. Influenced by Ashley J. Cross\'92s \'93From Lyrical Ballads to Lyrical Tales: Mary Robinson's Reputation and the Problem of Literary Debt,\'94 I am interested in exploring the careers of Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as my \'93case study\'94 for this chapter. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for \'93popularity,\'94 \'93celebrity,\'94 and \'93legacy\'94 which are both fruitful and nuanced. In addition to reading the extensive literature grappling with these concerns for individual authors, I am currently thinking of ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. I may also add scholarly uptake (perhaps through the proxy of  JSTOR articles, since JSTOR makes their archive accessible for experiments of this type) as a particular sub-type of \'93legacy.\'94}

\f0\fs22 \cf2 \'93since the children of gentle- / men continue to be educated in the traditional classical languages, their 'useless\'92 knowledge comes to stand\'85 as a pure sign of their noble status. Second, there is instilled in the 'middling' and commercial classes, as the upwardly mobile classes, a linguistic ambivalence which takes the form of suspicion toward the classical languages as useless knowledge, and envy of the social distinction they represent."

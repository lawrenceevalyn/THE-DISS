\f0\fs22 \cf2 How accurate does OCR need to be? This depends on how the OCR will then be used.\cf3  There is a substantial body of existing literature on this subject, which I will survey and integrate here. Thinking in these terms offers a different and sometimes uncomfortable definition for what it might mean to call a text \'93reliable\'94. In addition to evaluating the reliability of available OCR copies of Smith\'92s works, I will evaluate Project Gutenberg\'92s reliability. Project Gutenberg makes no guarantees of matching any particular edition of a text, and often presents Victorian editions (potentially bowdlerized) without warning, but nonetheless provides texts which are entirely made of actual words: does this make them more, or less, \'93reliable\'94 than OCR? How can different research questions change that evaluation?}

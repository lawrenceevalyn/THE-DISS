\f0\fs22 \cf0 In the following chapters, this dissertation weaves together an exploration of 1790s literature with an exploration of contemporary digital resources. As described in more detail above, chapter two uses Charlotte Smith to introduce the core differences between the databases under consideration, and to examine our conceptions of editions and reprinting. Chapter three uses Mary Robinson, whose printed output is expected to be largely similar in bibliographic terms to Smith\'92s (that is, they both consist of a large number of publications in a wide range of genres, which were successful enough to sustain a career as a writer), to examine questions about authorship and reception. Chapter four introduces an author who provides a contrast to both Smith and Robinson by producing a small number of titles in only one genre, Ann Radcliffe, prompting deeper inquiry into print runs and reviews, to develop richer metrics for \'93popularity\'94 or \'93importance.\'94 Chapter five introduces another contrasting author, of the opposing type, Hannah More, whose large number of publications at varied price points presents a technical challenge for the tools I have developed, and also a theoretical challenge for the concepts of literature I explore. A brief conclusion synthesizes my findings on these four authors, and presents my assessment of how they relate to 1790s literature as a whole.}

Although these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 have been described in sequence, they will be researched in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. [I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors in the canon] [To interpret those findings, I will look at what each model occludes and what it renders visible] [I\'92ll try anything that will help me answer my central question: what texts can be said to be \'93representative\'94 of this turbulent decade? And what do they \'93represent\'94?]}

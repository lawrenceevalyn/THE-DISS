This dissertation enters into an ongoing conversation [on how to understand late 18thC literature as a whole, resisting narratives of the history of the novel as a teleological path to realism and resisting narratives of the history of Romanticism that replicate myths of individual genius] [Instead, it seeks to follow in Michael Gamer\'92s footsteps by paying careful attention to the interdependent real variety of generic forms] [On a methodological level, this dissertation also enters into theoretical gestures toward \'93surface reading\'94 as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, Heather Love, and Cannon Schmitt, as part of a broader attempt to move away from paranoid modes of criticism, as discussed by Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski.] [\'93Distant reading\'94 as per Franco Moretti is thus used as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description; as particular computational approaches are developed in response to iterative prototyping, they are likely to contribute novel computational techniques to the field of the digital humanities, but these are not a primary/motivating concern..]}

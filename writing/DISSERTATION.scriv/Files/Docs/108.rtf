This dissertation enters into an ongoing shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century literature as a whole. It resists, both, the history of the novel as a teleological path to realism, and the history of Romanticism centred on the poets\'92 own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of, for example, Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also enters into theoretical gestures toward \'93surface reading\'94 or \'93literal reading\'94 as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, as part of a broader attempt to move away from paranoid modes of criticism, as discussed by Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. \'93Distant reading\'94 as per Franco Moretti is thus used as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. The particular computational approaches developed through the research process are likely to contribute novel computational techniques to the field of the digital humanities, but these techniques are not the primary motivating concern.}

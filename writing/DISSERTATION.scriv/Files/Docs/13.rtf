\f0\fs24 \cf0 My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?\
How do we select a small number of texts, to be \'93important\'94 or \'93representative\'94, from a larger body?\
How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?}

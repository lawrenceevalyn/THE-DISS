Problem Statement (or Motivation for the Study) \'96 Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context). \'96 Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters. \'96 Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigation.}

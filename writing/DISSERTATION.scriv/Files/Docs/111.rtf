The English Short Title Catalog (ESTC) lists 52,001 works printed in England during this decade. [The ESTC has already agreed to provide me with their database entries, which will have [X] kinds of information.] [I will do some things looking at all of these, like Lahti et al. who looked at 50,766 works categorized as history.] [I will also look in more detail at some subsets of these works, like Zwicker who examined a random sample of 500.]}

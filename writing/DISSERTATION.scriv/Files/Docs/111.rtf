The English Short Title Catalog (ESTC) lists 52,001 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. [Lahti et al., examining this basic bibliographic information for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, [show some techniques I might use. I am particularly interested to see which texts are the most reprinted].] [I expect to see Ann Radcliffe\'92s publication numbers appear notable, and be accompanied by trends in the titles of novels afterward] [I will also look in more detail at some subsets of these works, like Zwicker who examined a random sample of 500.] [I hope to get a sense of the relative popularity of generic forms within the mediascape] [As I engage with the content of works being published, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works appear to be politicized, and how openly they carry their political agendas]}

I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during my decade of interest. I may also supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women\'92s writing, Women Writers Online, the Oxford Text Archive, and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. [I am particularly interested in comparing these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how representative ECCO-TCP texts are, and what the impact is of adding the other collections.] [Then I will examine the texts themselves, to see what intertextual relationships they reveal.] I am comfortable with enough computational approaches to allow for flexibility: stylometric analysis of word choice; statistical correlation of bibliographical details; topic-modelling classification of texts according to a defined ontology; and network-map visualizations of textual prose similarity. I can select between and adapt these approaches based on the questions and limitations that emerge from my text-collection process. }

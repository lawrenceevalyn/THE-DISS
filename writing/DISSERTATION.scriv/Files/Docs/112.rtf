I will also assemble a relational database of information about the full range of literary works produced in my chosen chronological period, and as many digital texts as I can find. The three corpora I already possess \'97 the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus (2,188 texts from 1701-1800), the Chawton House Library corpus of women\'92s writing (46 texts 1723-1830), and my own collection of Gothic novels listed in Ann Tracy\'92s index (122 texts 1790-1830) \'97 provide a foundation to which I will add texts from collections like Women Writers Online, the Oxford Text Archive, and from digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. The ECCO-TCP corpus will likely account for a substantial percentage of the resulting collection, but by seeking a diversity of sources I hope to create a body of several hundred texts representing a unique range. \
 I am comfortable with enough computational approaches to allow for flexibility: stylometric analysis of word choice; statistical correlation of bibliographical details; topic-modelling classification of texts according to a defined ontology; and network-map visualizations of textual prose similarity. I can select between and adapt these approaches based on the questions and limitations that emerge from my text-collection process. }

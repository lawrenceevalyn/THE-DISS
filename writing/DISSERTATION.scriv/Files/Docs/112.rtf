I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during my decade of interest. I may also supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women\'92s writing, Women Writers Online, the Oxford Text Archive, and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to compare how each models the decade. I am particularly curious to see how the relative prominense of my key authors may look different through this different approach. Then I will examine the texts themselves, to see what intertextual relationships they reveal. Through my stylometric analysis, I will seek to identify and contextualize the characteristic language of my key authors, and particularly to see if any of them are outliers.}

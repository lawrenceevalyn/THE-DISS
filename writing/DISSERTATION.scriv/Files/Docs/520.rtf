My final chapter marries these lines of thoughts to ask what relationship \'93serious literature\'94 had to the non-literary, and especially to sub-literary fiction, in the 1790s. Does \'93serious\'94 fiction use \'93genre\'94 fiction parasitically or does it have its own separate genre norms? How do works market themselves? What makes writing \'93disreputable\'94? How do we recuperate \'93disreputable\'94 writing?}

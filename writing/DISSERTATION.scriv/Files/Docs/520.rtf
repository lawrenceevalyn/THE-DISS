My fifth chapter brings together these lines of thought, to ask what relationship \'93serious literature\'94 had to the \'93non-literary\'94, and especially to \'93sub-literary\'94 fiction, in the 1790s. Does \'93serious\'94 fiction use \'93genre\'94 fiction parasitically or does it have its own separate genre norms?  When and why is timeliness seen as \'93unserious\'94? What makes writing \'93disreputable\'94? How do we read \'93disreputable\'94 writing? This chapter engages most directly with the vexed roles and uses of the Gothic: drawing on the work of Michael Gamer and others, I will discuss the Gothic roots of Romanticism. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without \'93being\'94 Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being \'93unserious\'94 (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about \'93redeeming literary value\'94 in the Gothic.}

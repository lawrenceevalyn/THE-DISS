[I want to find practical ways forward to] to cope with the \'93great unread\'94 of literature, and to marry large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will particularly seek ways to account for the real variety within [works produced during] the chronologically narrow period 1789-99. [there is no \'93average\'94 or \'93normal\'94 text against which the \'93exceptional\'94 works can contrast, nor can any text be \'93representative.\'94] [Nonetheless, I will iteratively prototype models of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape.] [Each model will try to [render tractable] the complex interactions between the broad generic traditions of prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and to identify how particular writers have made use of these interactions in their works.] [One model will be large and distant: 52,001 bibliographic entries from the English Short Title Catalogue.] [One model will be smaller and closer: 2,188 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus.] [And one model will be a \'93traditional\'94 approach: closely reading and re-reading key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period to further both aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.]}

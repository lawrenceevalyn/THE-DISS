Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author\'92s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers\'92 claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the percerived \'93seriousness\'94 of their reputations. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for \'93popularity,\'94 \'93celebrity,\'94 and \'93legacy\'94 which are both nuanced and fruitful. I am currently thinking of ways to use reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. As my \'93case study\'94 for this chapter, I am interested in exploring the relationship between Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.}

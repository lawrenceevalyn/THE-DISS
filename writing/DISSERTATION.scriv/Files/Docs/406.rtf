The goal of this serious thinking is to remind us \'93that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized\'94 \'97 a discovery which will \'93shock\'94 us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite for the concept that future ways of life will also be organized differently. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to better integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing shocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that \'93our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices\'94 are not universal and invulnerable.\
Robert Miles describes the impact of the French Revolution as one centred less on the political events on the day in and of themselves, and more on the \'93historical rupture\'94 which the revolution was seen to constitute. He argues that this profoundly shaped far more than just political thought: \'93The sense of crisis \'85 linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.\'94 (Miles 11) [the context of the political debates demanded a particular timeliness / responsiveness from texts which affected much more than just political tracts.]}

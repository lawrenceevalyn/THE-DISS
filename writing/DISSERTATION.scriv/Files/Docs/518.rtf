In keeping with my contention that literary works must be considered as still \'93active\'94 even after their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered as important \'931790s literature\'94 due to prominent re-printing. This is another way of engaging with the idea of \'93legacy\'94 / \'93timelessness.\'94 The chapter\'92s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant?}

Do not include elements in it that describe how you intend to achieve this aim; reserve these for a later chapter. \'96 When you have written the conclusions to your whole study, check that they respond to this aim. If they don\'92t, change the aim or rethink your conclusions. \'96 If you change the aim, revise the motivation for studying it. \'96 Be sure to establish the scope of your study by identifying limitations of factors such as time, location, resources, or the established boundaries of particular fields or theories.}

The more I research Arab orientalism in the 18thC, the more I think the things I noticed during fields are just a little too late, chronologically, to make sense for the dissertation; I\'92ll keep my eyes peeled and add something in if I notice something cool, but am not planning on it being present for sure. (I\'92ll pursue it on the side for sure though / do some preliminary reading so it can be my second book project after the diss.)}

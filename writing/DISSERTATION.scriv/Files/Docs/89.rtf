Connecting discussion and conclusions: \'95 Your conclusions are what your discussion chapter has been arguing for. \'95 You could write the conclusions to your whole study as the last section of a chapter called \'91Discussion and Conclusions\'92, but it is usually preferable to have a separate \'91Conclusions\'92 chapter. \'95 If they form a separate chapter there should be no conclusions to the discussion chapter, and you should inform the reader of this in the discussion. Rules about conclusions: \'95 You should draw your conclusions solely from the discussion chapter. \'95 There should be little further discussion in the conclusions chapter. \'95 The conclusions should respond to the aim stated in the first chapter. \'95 Summaries are not conclusions. \'95 Conclusions should be crisp and concise. \'95 The conclusions can be used to briefly explore the implications of your findings.}

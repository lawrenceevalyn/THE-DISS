\f0\fs22 \cf0 The category \'93unsigned\'94 here captures works to which no name at all was signed (essentially, anonymous works, though in this period the absence of a name does not imply the concealment of a name as it would in the contemporary definition of \'93anonymous\'94) as well as pseudonymous works which offered no clues to an author\'92s gender (e.g. \'93A friend of peace\'94). \'93Organizations\'94 include missives from various branches of the government, reports from scholarly and charitable organizations, catalogues from various companies, and other works which are easily rejected as \'93non-literary.\'94 The identifier \'93blank,\'94 for ECCO, appears to capture both unsigned works and works by organizations. ECCO so thoroughly rejects the idea that \'93Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture\'94 or \'93Benevolent Institution for the Sole Purpose of Delivering Poor Married Women at Their Own Habitations\'94 could be considered as \'93authors\'94 that it does not record them in the \'93author\'94 field.}]]></Comment>

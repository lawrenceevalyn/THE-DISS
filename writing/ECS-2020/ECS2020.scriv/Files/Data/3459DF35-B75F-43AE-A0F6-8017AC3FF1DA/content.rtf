\f0\fs22 \cf0 These four databases \'97 ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and TCP \'97 are only part of the larger ecosystem of digital book repositories. These databases require substantial description, preliminary to analysis, since they have conventionally been treated as tools for accessing objects of study, rather than objects of study in themselves. Figure <$n#fig:databases-venn> shows a venn diagram of the approximate relative scale, and overlap in holdings, of the eight databases in three ecosystems which I will explore. \cf2 In blue is the purely academic ecosystem: \cf3 the \cf2 English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and the ECCO Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP). In pink is the commercial Google-backed ecosystem: Google Books, Google Ngrams, and HathiTrust. [I WILL REMOVE PROJECT GUTENBERG FROM THE FIGURE SINCE I DON\'92T HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS IT HERE.] The\cf3  division of databases into the\cf2 se ecosystems represent\cf3 s\cf2  my own analysis of the institutional processes and selection principles which have shaped \cf3 them\cf2 . Databases within a shared ecosystem may or may not be interoperable, but they made their initial textual selections with a similar logic, and make make their holdings available for a similar imagined audience. An immediate difference between them, for example, is that the commercial ecosystem treats textual holdings like a trade secret; Google Books and Google Ngrams as impossible to discuss except through the academically-inflected proxy of HathiTrust.}

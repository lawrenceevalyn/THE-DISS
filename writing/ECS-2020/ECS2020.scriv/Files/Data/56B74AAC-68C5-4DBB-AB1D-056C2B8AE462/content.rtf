\f0\fs22 \cf0 [Book history worries about what is lost in a shift to digital books often focus on qualitative/subtle/subjective features of the books themselves: the feel or colour of the paper, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://71A94DC9-3DD4-457A-A6A9-D801381C5F29"}}{\fldrslt etc.]}} [Often, digital facsimiles occlude even very unsubtle information which would be obvious to anyone handling a book in person, such as its length or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://9F9A2FBE-C031-46E6-A59D-2623243960D3"}}{\fldrslt size.]}} [But another form of absence is the book which still sits on its shelf, but undigitized, now worlds apart from its shelf-neighbour which is available digitally.] [Concerns about uneven digitization, too, are often voiced, though usually in general {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://2EAE27C6-6FB6-4A9B-A3C0-00DB8B42B442"}}{\fldrslt terms.]}} [It seems obvious that there must be systemic absences, but the precise scope and nature of those absences are equally obviously, difficult to define.] [These absences seem more probable, and more inscrutable, when there are financial/corporate motivations behind the scanning of books, as in the case of Google Books.] [Google Books is a veil which I have not yet been able to pierce, but it remains so corporate that it is of very little relevance in eighteenth-century studies.] [More relevant are ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and TCP.] [Here\'92s how many works each one has in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://41EB9F90-CC95-4873-822E-FEB7AD6145B1"}}{\fldrslt 1790s.]}} [The TCP thus contains an almost negligible 1% of the titles listed in the ESTC.] [These four resources cannot have identical holdings, because of their radically different sizes. How different are they? And what is different about them?]}

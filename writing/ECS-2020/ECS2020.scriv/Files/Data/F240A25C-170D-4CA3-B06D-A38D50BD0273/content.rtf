\f0\fs22 \cf0 Google Books began the 2010s by announcing, in mid-2010, that they had scanned more than 12 million books and intended to scan all known existing 129,864,880 books within a decade. At the end of 2010, they launched the Google Ngram viewer, as a research tool borne of all their scanning. Meanwhile, however, their legal court case continued, and scanning began to slow in 2012. In April 2016, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the Authors Guild's appeal, which means the lower court's decision stood, and Google would be allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law \'97 and also meant, therefore, that they could not display

In late 2019, Gale began allowing access to a new interface, the Gale Digital Scholar Lab, which dramatically changed the forms of access available for ECCO texts. It became possible not only to see the underlying OCR for texts, but to run pre-built text mining on it, and to download the OCR as text files.}

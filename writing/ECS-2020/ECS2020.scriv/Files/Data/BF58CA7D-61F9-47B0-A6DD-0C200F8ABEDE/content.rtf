\f0\fs22 \cf0 In Figure <$n#fig:4dbs-genders>, however, we can see that the overlooked group, unable to compete with male authors for archival attention, is not \'93female authors\'94 but \'93authors which are not associated with an individual {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://9C2A07D3-4B66-4CC4-9ADA-539A2534F6F1"}}{\fldrslt personality.\'94}} The underrepresentation of unsigned or corporate authors cannot be mapped onto the multicultural rhetoric of political representation, the way Guillory has described with gendered representation. \'93Unsigned\'94 or \'93pseudonymous\'94 people are not an identity category in the real world requiring equitable social standing: the unsigned and pseudonymous authors, if identified, would all turn out to have names, genders, races, class standings, and all the other traits of humans in the world. What their status as \'93unsigned\'94 in the database really means is not that those traits are absent \'97 it means that those traits are undetermined at the site of the title page.}

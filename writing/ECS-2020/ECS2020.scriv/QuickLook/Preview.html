<p class="itemTitle">the 'great unsigned'</p>
<p class="itemText">Franco Moretti famously posed digital methodologies as a solution to the “great unread” of literary history, with distant reading offering a way to finally fully account for the masses of works which ended up on the cutting room floor in the slaughterhouse of literature. [This framing has been partly rejected — cite Underwood]. </p>

<p class="itemTitle">18thC not amenable to text mining</p>
<p class="itemText">Computational distant reading of eighteenth century texts has much less emphasis on text mining than other eras. “Text mining” is a broad term for digital methodologies which examine the full texts of works under study: techniques like topic modelling and stylometry, for example, rely on having a machine-readable digital surrogate of the text’s contents. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has not traditionally been able to handle eighteenth century typefaces, so text-mining research relies on h...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">I'm testing Guillory's exclusion hypothesis</p>
<p class="itemText">Guillory’s Cultural Capital proposes that, if female authors, for example, do not make up a demographically accurate 50% of our literary syllabi, this is not necessarily because women’s writing has been excluded or repressed. Guillory draws a distinction between rhetoric “construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power” — that is, the patriarchal suppression of works by women, which can be addres...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Ridddel & Troy support exclusion hypothesis?</p>
<p class="itemText">Do the books which have been digitized reflect the population of published books?Allen Riddell and Troy J. Bassett also explore this question, for novels published for the first time in the British Isles in 1836 and 1838. They posit several reasons why digitization might not be truly random, even for mass-digitization projects which seem to acquire texts indiscriminatly. [First, selection effects (what gets into the library). Then, digitization effects (eg shelves that are together.] They find t...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Guillory</p>
<p class="itemText">Guillory’s Cultural Capital proposes that 1990s critique of literary canons misunderstood their own value when they rely on a rhetoric of “representation.” By proceeding as if representation on syllabi was equivalent to political representation — and, indeed, by assuming that works by marginalized authors “represent” the marginalized groups to which the authors belong, such that “representation” is determined solely by an author’s biography rather than the content of the work — Guillory posits t...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">corpus > canon</p>
<p class="itemText">twenty years later, we are still debating the need for “literary criticism … to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain” (Guillory 265), now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti’s coinage of ‘distant reading’: the problem for which “[r]eading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” is the problem of conceiving of world literature, rather than the “canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature...</p>

Of the 47 editions printed in England between 1784 and 1807, 42 are included in the ESTC, and 5 do not appear in the ESTC because they were printed after 1800 and thus fall outside its purview. ECCO contains 37 of Smith’s 47 editions, all of which also appear in the ESTC. ECCO is missing the 5 editions not listed in the ESTC (since it, too, does not contain works past ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Smith 'winnowing down'</p>
<p class="itemText">Smith’s publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith’s “full” output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. The most interesting exclusions occur earlier and later in Smith’s publishing career, such as the first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), which is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere, or the publications in the last ye...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Q</p>
<p class="itemText">The naive hypothesis, investigating a historical phenomenon, is that factors like systemic sexism are likely to have an effect. As I have shown in chapter two, the digital archives currently used by eigtheenth-century scholars were created during their own historic moments, which influenced their priorities as texts were digitized. Resources which provide more information about particular works — such as ECCO, which provides PDF scans of microfiche, or the TCP, which provides detailed XML-encode...</p>

<p class="itemText">They cannot be compared in their entirety, but let us examine works published in England, between 1789 and 1799. After removing misclassified works, the ESTC contained 51,090 titles, ECCO 26,848 titles, HathiTrust 8,220 titles, and the TCP only 525 titles. ECCO, in all its capaciousness, therefore contains only 52.5% of the titles listed in the ES...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">lots of men</p>
<p class="itemText">Smaller, less comprehensive archives do generally dedicate a higher percentage of their space to male authors. As Figure <$n#fig:4dbs-genders-justmen> shows, 43% of the 51,090 titles in the ESTC from this decade are identifiably by men, which rises substantially to 69% for HathiTrust and 67% for the TCP.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">unsigned overlooked</p>
<p class="itemText">Here we can see that the overlooked group, unable to compete with male authors for archival attention, is not “female authors” but “authors which are not associated with an individual personality.” The underrepresentation of unsigned or corporate authors cannot be mapped onto the multicultural rhetoric of political representation, the way Guillory has described with gendered representation. “Unsigned” or “pseudonymous” people are not an identity category in the real world requiring equitable soc...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">caused by genre</p>
<p class="itemText">The higher proportion of works by women in the TCP corpus could be explained by an overrepresentation of novels there. During the years 1789-99, 20.2% of the new novels written in England were attributed to female names on their title pages and prefaces.</p>

<p class="itemText">Women made up a nearly negligible portion of the titles published in England during the 1790s. If one were to choose a title at random, it would be more likely to be written by a man named John than by a woman. But we do not choose titles at random— even in large-scale digital humanities research. We neglect the genres from which women are most strongly excluded: medical texts, legal texts, sermons, and other discourses tied to specialized (male) occupations. We prefer fiction and poetry, the fo...</p>

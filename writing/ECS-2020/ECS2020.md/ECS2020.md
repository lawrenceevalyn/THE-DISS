History of the Book Database: How Four Repositories of Eighteenth-Century Works Select for Gender.

[Book history worries about what is lost in a shift to digital books often focus on qualitative/subtle/subjective features of the books themselves: the feel or colour of the paper, etc.][^cf1] [Often, digital facsimiles occlude even very unsubtle information which would be obvious to anyone handling a book in person, such as its length or size.][^cf2] [But another form of absence is the book which still sits on its shelf, but undigitized, now worlds apart from its shelf-neighbour which is available digitally.] [Concerns about uneven digitization, too, are often voiced, though usually in general terms.][^cf3] [It seems obvious that there must be systemic absences, but the precise scope and nature of those absences are equally obviously, difficult to define.] [These absences seem more probable, and more inscrutable, when there are financial/corporate motivations behind the scanning of books, as in the case of Google Books.] [Google Books is a veil which I have not yet been able to pierce, but it remains so corporate that it is of very little relevance in eighteenth-century studies.] [More relevant are ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and TCP.] [Here's how many works each one has in the 1790s.][^cf4] [The TCP thus contains an almost negligible 1% of the titles listed in the ESTC.] [These four resources cannot have identical holdings, because of their radically different sizes. How different are they? And what is different about them?]

[Katherine Bode has called for digital histories of literary systems.][^cf5] [The system I examine is eighteenth-century studies.] [This is thus a history of the book database, rather than a history of the book, but with an 18thC lens.] [Underwood discusses glancingly how, in practice, digital repositories are the foundation of corpus building.][^cf6] [Underwood has begun with saying some stuff about sampling.][^cf7] [Underwood's comments about sampling react to Franco Moretti.] Franco Moretti famously posed digital methodologies as a solution to the "great unread" of literary history, with distant reading offering a way to finally fully account for the masses of works which ended up on the cutting room floor in the slaughterhouse of literature.[^cf8] [This has also been tied to questions about canons, especially since Moretti linked this move to the idea of a 'world literature.'] [But Guillory has already shown us that the canon is not a real list, it is an imagined whole evoked by the partial manifestation of the syllabus.][^cf9] [A corpus or a database is not limited the way a syllabus is.][^cf10] [The link between canonical representation and digital literary studies is not the database finally offering a capacious enough canon that it can now be 'opened' all the way --- ie a technological solution allowing literary history to achieve full representation.] [Instead, doing a history of the book database reveals that the prior for representation is always deferred. Despite the suggestion of completion/wholeness of each individual resource,[^cf11] comparing them to each other immediately reveals that each is only able to represent, and attempt to be representative of, an imagined larger, prior whole.]

[Guillory talks about how works are selected from the imagined whole of the canon in order to end up on syllabi[^cf12] --- here, works are selected from the real, finite whole of a library's collection in order to end up in their database.] [Allen Riddell and Troy J. Bassett note that the books which have been digitized might easily not reflect the population of published books, if there has been bias either at the stage of library collection or at the stage of digitization.][^cf13] [Give their examples of collection and digitization biases.] [They found that, indeed, for British novels in 1836 and 1838, women have been underrepresented.] [This actually is something like Guillory's exclusion hypothesis; these are women who were not barred from access to literacy itself, but who failed to attract the stewardship of future generations.] [Riddell and Bassett assume that the same general trend will be present in non-British, non-Victorian, and non-fiction literary fields.] [This research methodology relies on having an actual non-imagined list for the "whole" of "books that were published," for the proxies to be compared against --- Riddell & Bassett use [SOMETHING] for their list.] [Expanding the parameters under consideration makes the beginning list harder to find, but is also necessary to test the generalizability of the phenomenon.] [Remaining within the British context, but expanding to all genres, and to more than one year, I treat the ESTC as, if not exactly a complete list of the whole of "books that were published,"[^cf14] at least a substantial list against which other resources can be compared.] [This is justified for a study of digitality's impact on the discipline since the ESTC is a reasonable proxy for "books that a scholar could theoretically access in person."] [ESTC, ECCO, HathiTrust, and TCP all offer very different access to the imagined prior whole of "English literature of the 1790s."]

[Despite the impression they give of always being 'up to date', digital resources often reflect much earlier conceptions of that imagined whole.] [It has now been more than thirty years since feminist criticism started having major successes in 18thC studies.] [ECCO began in 2003, well after figures like Charlotte Smith had been 'recovered.'] [But the microfilms underlying ECCO date from the 1980s: so ECCO might easily reflect 1980s priorities about what kinds of works are work investing in and redistributing.] [Charlotte Smith offers an interesting case study in a 'successful' recovery project. This allows me to ask: to what extent do research infrastructures 'lag behind' scholarly consensus? No eighteenth centuryist is now likely to say that Smith is irrelevant or unimportant to the period. In the infrastructure of literary canons as described by Guillory, she has certainly succeeded: she is given prominent space in all anthologies of Romantic literature; she regularly appears on introductory syllabi, including surveys of all British literature; there are scholarly editions, and seminars, and dissertations, conference panels, and every other sign that she is an important and valued writer. But what about digital infrastructures? Are they "up to date"? For many I would say, not really.]

Figure 1: An alluvial chart, showing the winnowing down of Smith's works from database to database. Of the 47 editions printed in England between 1784 and 1807, 42 are included in the ESTC, and 5 do not appear in the ESTC because they were printed after 1800 and thus fall outside its purview. ECCO contains 37 of Smith's 47 editions, all of which also appear in the ESTC. ECCO is missing the 5 editions not listed in the ESTC (since it, too, does not contain works past 1800), as well as another 5 works. HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith's 47 editions, but unlike ECCO, these are not a simple subset of the ESTC. HathiTrust contains one of the 5 editions excluded from the ESTC, and one of the 5 editions included in ESTC but excluded from ECCO. The remaining 16 HathiTrust editions appear in both the ESTC and ECCO. ECCO-TCP includes only 2 of Smith's 47 editions, both of which appear in every previous database. Graph generated using RAW Graphs (Mauri et al.).

Smith's publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith's "full" output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. The most interesting exclusions occur earlier and later in Smith's publishing career, such as the first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), which is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere, or the publications in the last years of her life, which are excluded from the chronological focus of most resources but can still appear in HathiTrust. Of particular interest is the fact that Beachy Head, which is now one of Smith's most frequently anthologized and taught poems, does not appear in a single digital database. None of these inclusions or exclusions represent an agenda against (or for) Smith, or indeed an interpretive choice at all, but they nonetheless shape the disciplinary infrastructure.
Figure 1 shows how Smith's presence in four major databases has the effect of winnowing down her full output arbitrarily. Even the largest collection, the 42 editions included in the ESTC, is not comprehensive: since the ESTC does not include any works published after 1800, it excludes volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802), three works for children (Conversations, Introducing Poetry, 1804; History of England, 1806; and Natural History of Birds, 1807), and the posthumous publication that now forms a major part of Smith's reputation as a poet, Beachy Head (1807). ECCO lacks these five editions for the same reason, and is also missing five others: the first and ninth editions of Elegiac Sonnets (1784 and 1800), the second edition of The Banished Man (1795), the first edition of Minor Morals (1798), and the second edition of Rambles Farther (1800).
HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith's 47 editions, though these are not a simple subset of the ESTC and ECCO. Unlike the ESTC and ECCO, HathiTrust contains volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802)[^cf15]. This is the only post-1800 work which appears in HathiTrust, however--- the others are also missing, including the important volume Beachy Head (1807). There is one work included in HathiTrust but not in ECCO, the second edition of The Banished Man (1795). Whereas ECCO does not include works unless there is a complete copy available, HathiTrust provides scans of volumes 2, 3, and 4, and simply implies through their numbering that there is a missing first volume --- perhaps in the optimism that a volume 1 will appear from another library's holdings, to complete the set later.[^cf16] The remaining HathiTrust included titles appear in both the ESTC and ECCO, and a further 21 titles appear as facsimiles in ECCO but not in HathiTrust. At first blush it is somewhat surprising that HathiTrust has failed to include works which are, demonstrably, in known locations at institutional libraries, and in physically sound condition to be scanned--- but the scans making up HathiTrust bear no relation to the scans in ECCO. The Young Philosopher (1798), for example, appears in ECCO sourced from a British Library copy, but the HathiTrust images are "Google-digitized" from the New York Public Library. Google's rapacious book-scanning, evidently, was not as thorough as ECCO's sustained scholarly project.
The smallest subset of all of these texts is the ECCO-TCP holding of just two titles: the second edition of Celestina (1791), and the first edition of The Emigrants (1793). Both titles appear in all larger databases, including HathiTrust (though, as I will discuss, they arrive in HathiTrust from a different source). The Emigrants is included in ECCO-TCP as one file, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the Huntington Library. Celestina is included as four files, one for each of four volumes, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the British Library. Both works were first reproduced in the microfilm version produced 1982-2002 in by Research Publications,[^cf17] then digitized in 2003 (released on ECCO in June 2004), and finally published as TEI XML files in January 2007. The current files have been kept up to date with changes in TEI standards, and were created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl. The bibliographic metadata for these works is the same between ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records. In HathiTrust, however, the source text for The Emigrants is a University of California Library copy, rather than the British Library, scanned by Google Books, and presented with substantially less detailed bibliographic information. The ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records for The Emigrants all provide the same physical description "ix,[3],68[i.e. 60]p. ; 4⁰" with the same note"[n]umbers 9-16 omitted in pagination; text is continuous." HathiTrust, in contrast, gives the physical description "ix, 68 p. ; 26 cm," which is both more and less information: a quarto volume could be a range of sizes, so HathiTrust provides new detail by giving a measurement in centimetres, but the data on page numbers is now misleading. Consulting the HathiTrust facsimile shows that it, too, omits the page numbers 9-16, going directly from page 8 to page 17 without a break in the poem. HathiTrust also omits information on the three unnumbered pages between the preface and the poem. Evidently, a human did consult the book, to identify a nine-page preface in roman numerals, and the page number on the last page, but they did not carry out a full collation.

Only two of Smith's works appear in all four databases: the second edition of Celestina (1791), and the first edition of The Emigrants (1793). How are these books represented by these four proxies?

Computational distant reading of eighteenth century texts has much less emphasis on text mining than other eras. "Text mining" is a broad term for digital methodologies which examine the full texts of works under study: techniques like topic modelling and stylometry, for example, rely on having a machine-readable digital surrogate of the text's contents. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has not traditionally been able to handle eighteenth century typefaces, so text-mining research relies on hand-encoded texts. Encoding text manually is incredibly labor intensive. 

Guillory's Cultural Capital proposes that, if female authors, for example, do not make up a demographically accurate 50% of our literary syllabi, this is not necessarily because women's writing has been excluded or repressed. Guillory draws a distinction between rhetoric "construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power"[^cf18] --- that is, the patriarchal suppression of works by women, which can be addressed by now 'representing' the excluded works within the canon --- versus what he sees as the real cause, a historical fact that "women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral."[^cf19] Applied to the digital database, the first explanation, which might be termed the 'exclusion hypothesis,' would manifest in the form of massive archives with large numbers of works by men and women, which get filtered through exclusionary scholarly processes into smaller, selective repositories where men now make up an oversized share. The second explanation, the 'NEEDS A NAME' hypothesis, works by women will have a diminished role from the very beginning, since women were prevented from writing in the first place.

Do the books which have been digitized reflect the population of published books? Allen Riddell and Troy J. Bassett also explore this question, for novels published for the first time in the British Isles in 1836 and 1838.[^cf20] They posit several reasons why digitization might not be truly random, even for mass-digitization projects which seem to acquire texts indiscriminatly. [First, selection effects (what gets into the library). Then, digitization effects (eg shelves that are together.] They find that these factors, together, have in fact led to an underrepresentation of novels by women in mass digital archives.

Guillory's Cultural Capital proposes that 1990s critique of literary canons misunderstood their own value when they rely on a rhetoric of "representation." By proceeding as if representation on syllabi was equivalent to political representation --- and, indeed, by assuming that works by marginalized authors "represent" the marginalized groups to which the authors belong, such that "representation" is determined solely by an author's biography rather than the content of the work[^cf21] --- Guillory posits that we make two mistakes.

** Bring in Underwood on misrecognizing the fear of big data
Underwood rejects the easy/expected critique of technological hierarchies reinforcing other hierarchies: "This kind of fearmongering is the flip side of technophilic hype; both are wildly exaggerated. Managing a whole digital library, like HathiTrust, is admittedly a big task. But specific research questions usually engage a small part of the library. Most of the analysis in this book can be done on a desktop, although some of the programs might take an afternoon to run. Nothing discussed here required computing power that is available only at a few institutions." (Underwood 157)


"...it must also be borne in mind that the archives preserve (and bury) hundreds and thousands of writers, of various social origins and identities. The question for us, in reconsidering the rhetoric of canon revision, is why any particular noncanonical author discovered by a research program has to be presented as excluded from the canon."[^cf22]


"in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power, the strategy of opening the canon aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. In so specifying 'representation' as the political effect of the canon, the liberal pluralist critique fails to consider what other effects, even political effects, the canon may have at its institutional site." (Guillory 8)
"the construction of a syllabus begins with selection; it does not begin with a 'process of elimination.' What is excluded from the syllabus is not excluded in the same way that an individual is excluded or marginalized as the member of a social minority, socially disenfranchised." (Guillory 33)
"The reason more women authors, for example, are not represented in older literatures is not primarily that their works were routinely excluded... as a consequence of their social identity as women. The historical reason is that, with few exceptions before the eighteenth century, women were routinely excluded from access to literacy, or were proscribed from composition or publication in the genres considered to be serious rather than ephemeral." (Guillory 15)

"When canons were at issue, the struggle to define a single representative list was motivated by the limitations of space that force anthologies and syllabi to distill the past down to a single // set of texts. In such a confined space, the games critics play are genuinely zero-sum in character: new canons can come into being only by displacing old ones. ... Once researchers have created digital collections of several thousand titles, it becomes unnecessary to decide on a single representation of the past, since digital collections are easy to subdivide and rebalance. A collection of this sort is analogous to a library, not to a syllabus or anthology: it doesn't replace one version of the past with another but provides an enlarged repertoire of options. Instead of arguing about samples as if they were competing canons, we can adopt a relational mode of reasoning about literary history, akin to the methods of social science." (Underwood 176-7)
"Of course, it would be a lot of work for researchers to construct new samples completely from scratch for every project. So, in practice, digital libraries provide an important resource, allowing researchers to construct different samples by subdividing a larger collection. In pursuing work of this kind, we don't necessarily have to decide whether libraries are correctly balanced. We can rebalance our samples as needed." (Underwood 178)

twenty years later, we are still debating the need for "literary criticism ... to conceptualize a new disciplinary domain" (Guillory 265), now in the context of computation. The reconceptualization of literary study itself is at the core of Franco Moretti's coinage of 'distant reading': the problem for which "[r]eading 'more' seems hardly to be the solution"[^cf23] is the problem of conceiving of world literature, rather than the "canonical fraction, which is not even one per cent of published literature."[^cf24] His new methods are meant to enable literary studies to examine a new object. The field of distant reading has been moving away from Moretti himself. However, it is still shaped by the attempt to redefine the disciplinary domain of literary studies. In many cases, the new domain is no longer the "canon" but the "corpus," a collection of texts which are studied en masse for macroanalytical insights. Katherine Bode, for example, in "The Equivalence of 'Close' and 'Distant' Reading," argues that Moretti and Matthew Jockers replicate the approaches of New Criticism with their corpora, and calls for "a new scholarly object of analysis"[^cf25] that directly examines historical and textual context of corpora as representations of "literary systems."[^cf26] Lauren Klein, too, treats the textual corpus as the new object of literary analysis requiring curation, contextualization, and interpretation. Her critique argues that "it's not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race," but also that these failings are not inevitable: "it's not that distant reading can't do this work," she insists, "it's that it's yet to sufficiently do so."[^cf27] Bode, too, despite her strong critique of distant reading as it has been practiced by Moretti and Jockers, does not blame distant reading itself. Distant readers like Moretti and Jockers, she argues, "while claiming direct and objective access to 'everything,' ... represent and explore only a very limited proportion of the literary system, and do so in an abstract and ahistorical way."[^cf28] Klein, like Bode, calls for "more corpora---more accessible corpora---that perform the work of recovery or resistance" to allow research "beyond quote 'representative' samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole."[^cf29] This framing re-creates, at the site of the corpus, the identical narratives of exclusion and representation which were previously located in critiques of the canon.

The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus is not without grounds. As this dissertation will explore in depth, challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new "great unread." Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to do with texts. For example, the English Short Title Catalogue records 51,965 titles printed in England between 1789 and 1799. The corpus most commonly used for DH work on eighteenth-century literature, ECCO-TCP, includes only 466 titles for that same time period. What are the other 51,499 titles, why are they accessible in the ways they are, and what does it mean for digital eighteenth-century studies that they are not included? Although the examination of databases prompts similar hypotheses of exclusion as in longstanding conversations about canons, digital databases do not simply replicate new canons.

![][fig-databases-venn]
Figure 2: A hand-drawn venn diagram of the relative scale and overlapping holdings of databases containing 1790s literature. The orientation and colour-coding of the ovals groups them into three ecosystems: the academic databases in blue pointing left, the commercial databases in pink pointing right, and the crowdsourced databases in green oriented horizontally.

The naive hypothesis, investigating a historical phenomenon, is that factors like systemic sexism are likely to have an effect. As I have shown in chapter two, the digital archives currently used by eigtheenth-century scholars were created during their own historic moments, which influenced their priorities as texts were digitized. Resources which provide more information about particular works --- such as ECCO, which provides PDF scans of microfiche, or the TCP, which provides detailed XML-encoded transcripts --- inevitably provide their more thorough information about fewer texts. The ESTC is able to include so many works in its database in part because it includes so little about each work: little more than the information found on the title page, and a list of libraries where the original can be consulted. As the more resource-intensive archives created their digital surrogates, therefore, the texts they include are likely to be less indiscriminate, and more strongly influenced by a personal assessment of what works are most important. In many other areas, writing by women has been dismissed as less important or worthy of serious study than writing by men. If we compare the holdings of major digital archives, do the smaller and more resource-intensive archives show evidence of systematically opting not to invest in women's writing?

Four relevant databases are the English Short Title Catalogue,[^cf30] Eighteenth Century Collections Online,[^cf31] HathiTrust,[^cf32] and the Text Creation Partnership.[^cf33] 

They cannot be compared in their entirety, but let us examine works published in England,[^cf34] between 1789 and 1799.[^cf35] After removing misclassified works, the ESTC contained 51,090 titles, ECCO 26,848 titles, HathiTrust 8,220 titles, and the TCP only 525 titles. ECCO, in all its capaciousness, therefore contains only 52.5% of the titles listed in the ESTC. The TCP provides access to an almost negligible 1% of the works published.

I assigned genders.[^cf36]

Smaller, less comprehensive archives do generally dedicate a higher percentage of their space to male authors. As Figure <$n#fig:4dbs-genders-justmen> shows, 43% of the 51,090 titles in the ESTC from this decade are identifiably by men,[^cf37] which rises substantially to 69% for HathiTrust and 67% for the TCP.

![][4dbs-genders-justmen]


Here we can see that the overlooked group, unable to compete with male authors for archival attention, is not "female authors" but "authors which are not associated with an individual personality."[^cf38] The underrepresentation of unsigned or corporate authors cannot be mapped onto the multicultural rhetoric of political representation, the way Guillory has described with gendered representation. "Unsigned" or "pseudonymous" people are not an identity category in the real world requiring equitable social standing: the unsigned and pseudonymous authors, if identified, would all turn out to have names, genders, races, class standings, and all the other traits of humans in the world. What their status as "unsigned" in the database really means is not that those traits are absent --- it means that those traits are undetermined at the site of the title page.
Scholars have worked to infrastructurally eliminate the "unsigned" author. Names are placed into the relevant database fields wherever possible, supplying new information that cannot be found on the title page and may have been entirely unavailable to eighteenth century readers. Jane Austen's works, for example, were published unsigned, and then "by a lady," but will always be present in the database under "Austen, Jane." There is obvious practical use in disseminating author identifications --- indeed, there is very little point in determining the authors of pseudonymous works if this information is not fully incorporated into the scholarly record. But the particular implementation also occludes how eighteenth century readers actually encountered author information. An identified name overwrites the information recorded on the title page. "Real" names are provided even in cases where this substitution contains little real information. One work, titled "Observations on the origin and effects of the Test Act" and printed in 1790, has its author listed in the ESTC as "Hudson, active 1790." A note suggests that this attribution is somewhat shaky: "Attribution from Halkett & Laing which seems to be based on a MS attribution on O copy title page, no longer legible. O copy with MS date May 18. 1790. Verify number and position of advertisement leaves." This is the only item in the ESTC attributed to "Hudson, 1790" so identifying "Hudson" in this way does not provide value by linking the work to another. In contrast, the title page attribution identifies the author as "a dissenter." This, I contend, is a more useful identification of the author.

![][4dbs-genders]

The higher proportion of works by women in the TCP corpus could be explained by an overrepresentation of novels there. During the years 1789-99, 20.2% of the new novels written in England were attributed to female names on their title pages and prefaces.[^cf39]

Why are EEBO and ECCO so weird to use together? Because in the 80s when their images were born, EEBO was scanned by University Microfilms, ECCO by Research Publications Inc, and these two households alike in dignity, ancient grudge, etc etc

Women made up a nearly negligible portion of the titles published in England during the 1790s. If one were to choose a title at random, it would be more likely to be written by a man named John than by a woman. But we do not choose titles at random--- even in large-scale digital humanities research. We neglect the genres from which women are most strongly excluded: medical texts, legal texts, sermons, and other discourses tied to specialized (male) occupations. We prefer fiction and poetry, the forms most open to women. Even then, we overrepresent women. I want to be very explicit that the overrepresentation of women is not inappropriate: it strikes me as a very positive sign that we might have grown less sexist in the intervening two hundred years. Instead, the logic of "representation," which underpins discussion of literary canons and syllabi, is not a good fit for understanding the infrastructural impact of contemporary digital databases. 

Discovering that women account for only 3% of attributed authors at the end of the eighteenth century 

- 3% is really small
- Scholarly work overrepresents women
- It is fine and appropriate to overrepresent women, per Guillory
--- A core contention of feminist scholarship is that works by women have a heightened relevance or historic interest to us today; scholarly attention does not need to exactly replicate past attention
------ We don't have to be recovering "popular" / "successful" literature to make it interesting/worthwhile

We have not truly grappled with the challenge that the eighteenth century poses to our idea of "the author."

[^cf30]: ESTC data was generously provided by the ESTC Editorial Team in early 2017, and reflects the contents of the ESTC Database as hosted by the British Library at that time. They delivered a dataset containing 51,965 records, matching a database query for works published in England 1789-99. I conducted additional data cleaning in OpenRefine to check all publication dates and locations, removing any which fell outside my strict parameter (e.g., those attributed to a range of dates when the earliest date preceded 1789), which brought the total number of records analyzed down to 51,090.

[^cf31]: MARC records of ECCO holdings were generously provided by the University of Toronto Libraries. These records were not straightforward to work with; I used MarcEdit to convert them to csv format, then OpenRefine to remove the many duplicates (based on the unique Gale Document Number) and then to remove all works not published in England 1789-99.

[^cf32]: HathiTrust data is publicly available. I created a HathiTrust "collection" of works published in England 1789-99 and downloaded the related metadata.

[^cf33]: TCP data is publicly available. I am very grateful for the assistance of Brian Gauch in writing a program to extract bibliographic metadata from the XML headers of TCP texts.

[^cf34]: Many place names, such as "Plymouth" or "Halifax," can refer to locations inside or outside of England. I opted to avoid false negatives, at the expense of including more false positives: when I could not rule out England, I assumed the location referred to England. "Plymouth, M.A.," therefore, would be removed as referring to the city in the United States, but "Plymouth" alone would be retained as potentially referring to the city in Devon. Some of these assumptions were a bit improbable, as in the cases where I assumed "Halifax" referred to the township in West Yorkshire rather than to the city in Canada, but I preferred to employ a consistent systematic rule ("England until proven guilty") rather than follow a case-by-case hunch about likelihood. I do no expect the false positives to impact my findings: relatively few works had ambiguous publishers, and I have no reason to believe the effects I observe would be strongly different outside of England.

[^cf35]: Many works are assigned ambiguous dates, or ranges of dates. In order to exclude non-1790s works via a consistent rule, I assumed works were published in the earliest year proposed. I would therefore remove a work identified as "1780 to 1790," but keep works identified as "1791 to 1794" or "1798 to 1800."

[^cf36]: After discovering the limits of multiple automatic methods for guessing gender from a first name, all of which were clearly not created with the eighteenth century in mind, I assigned the gender assessments manually. Most texts were associated with a small number of extremely common names which presented no interpretive difficulties (John, William, Thomas, James), but as I reached the long tail of publications I identified specific individuals to confirm that, for example, Tench Coxe was male and Benedikte Naubert was female.

[^cf37]: The category of works "identifiably by men" includes named authors with male first names (e.g., John), semi-unsigned authors whose author attribution clearly signalled male authorship (e.g., "Mr. R"), and pseudonyms which similarly must apply to men (e.g., "a country clergyman"). It excludes authors identified only by their initials, even when a subject expert could match those initials to a specific individual of known gender (e.g., W.H. Ireland).

[^cf38]: The category "unsigned" here captures works to which no name at all was signed (essentially, anonymous works, though in this period the absence of a name does not imply the concealment of a name as it would in the contemporary definition of "anonymous") as well as pseudonymous works which offered no clues to an author's gender (e.g. "A friend of peace"). "Organizations" include missives from various branches of the government, reports from scholarly and charitable organizations, catalogues from various companies, and other works which are easily rejected as "non-literary." The identifier "blank," for ECCO, appears to capture both unsigned works and works by organizations. ECCO so thoroughly rejects the idea that "Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture" or "Benevolent Institution for the Sole Purpose of Delivering Poor Married Women at Their Own Habitations" could be considered as "authors" that it does not record them in the "author" field.

Franco Moretti famously posed digital methodologies as a solution to the "great unread" of literary history, with distant reading offering a way to finally fully account for the masses of works which ended up on the cutting room floor in the slaughterhouse of literature. [This framing has been partly rejected --- cite Underwood]. 

The literature it is easiest to neglect is writing that circulates without an author.

Computational distant reading of eighteenth century texts has much less emphasis on text mining than other eras. "Text mining" is a broad term for digital methodologies which examine the full texts of works under study: techniques like topic modelling and stylometry, for example, rely on having a machine-readable digital surrogate of the text's contents. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has not traditionally been able to handle eighteenth century typefaces, so text-mining research relies on hand-encoded texts. Encoding text manually is incredibly labor intensive.

Figure 1: A hand-drawn venn diagram of the relative scale and overlapping holdings of databases containing 1790s literature. The orientation and colour-coding of the ovals groups them into three ecosystems: the academic databases in blue pointing left, the commercial databases in pink pointing right, and the crowdsourced databases in green oriented horizontally.

Figure 2: An alluvial chart, showing the winnowing down of Smith's works from database to database. Of the 47 editions printed in England between 1784 and 1807, 42 are included in the ESTC, and 5 do not appear in the ESTC because they were printed after 1800 and thus fall outside its purview. ECCO contains 37 of Smith's 47 editions, all of which also appear in the ESTC. ECCO is missing the 5 editions not listed in the ESTC (since it, too, does not contain works past 1800), as well as another 5 works. HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith's 47 editions, but unlike ECCO, these are not a simple subset of the ESTC. HathiTrust contains one of the 5 editions excluded from the ESTC, and one of the 5 editions included in ESTC but excluded from ECCO. The remaining 16 HathiTrust editions appear in both the ESTC and ECCO. ECCO-TCP includes only 2 of Smith's 47 editions, both of which appear in every previous database.

Smith's publishing career began in 1784 and continued until her death in 1806; when I refer to Smith's "full" output, I consider all 47 editions of her works published in her lifetime or in the year immediately following her death. The most interesting exclusions occur earlier and later in Smith's publishing career, such as the first edition of her immensely influential Elegiac Sonnets (1784), which is listed in the ESTC but not available in facsimile anywhere, or the publications in the last years of her life, which are excluded from the chronological focus of most resources but can still appear in HathiTrust. Of particular interest is the fact that Beachy Head, which is now one of Smith's most frequently anthologized and taught poems, does not appear in a single digital database. None of these inclusions or exclusions represent an agenda against (or for) Smith, or indeed an interpretive choice at all, but they nonetheless shape the disciplinary infrastructure.
Figure 2 shows how Smith's presence in four major databases has the effect of winnowing down her full output arbitrarily. Even the largest collection, the 42 editions included in the ESTC, is not comprehensive: since the ESTC does not include any works published after 1800, it excludes volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802), three works for children (Conversations, Introducing Poetry, 1804; History of England, 1806; and Natural History of Birds, 1807), and the posthumous publication that now forms a major part of Smith's reputation as a poet, Beachy Head (1807). ECCO lacks these five editions for the same reason, and is also missing five others: the first and ninth editions of Elegiac Sonnets (1784 and 1800), the second edition of The Banished Man (1795), the first edition of Minor Morals (1798), and the second edition of Rambles Farther (1800).
HathiTrust contains 18 of Smith's 47 editions, though these are not a simple subset of the ESTC and ECCO. Unlike the ESTC and ECCO, HathiTrust contains volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802)[^cf1]. This is the only post-1800 work which appears in HathiTrust, however--- the others are also missing, including the important volume Beachy Head (1807). There is one work included in HathiTrust but not in ECCO, the second edition of The Banished Man (1795). Whereas ECCO does not include works unless there is a complete copy available, HathiTrust provides scans of volumes 2, 3, and 4, and simply implies through their numbering that there is a missing first volume --- perhaps in the optimism that a volume 1 will appear from another library's holdings, to complete the set later.[^cf2] The remaining HathiTrust included titles appear in both the ESTC and ECCO, and a further 21 titles appear as facsimiles in ECCO but not in HathiTrust. At first blush it is somewhat surprising that HathiTrust has failed to include works which are, demonstrably, in known locations at institutional libraries, and in physically sound condition to be scanned--- but the scans making up HathiTrust bear no relation to the scans in ECCO. The Young Philosopher (1798), for example, appears in ECCO sourced from a British Library copy, but the HathiTrust images are "Google-digitized" from the New York Public Library. Google's rapacious book-scanning, evidently, was not as thorough as ECCO's sustained scholarly project.
The smallest subset of all of these texts is the ECCO-TCP holding of just two titles: the second edition of Celestina (1791), and the first edition of The Emigrants (1793). Both titles appear in all larger databases, including HathiTrust (though, as I will discuss, they arrive in HathiTrust from a different source). The Emigrants is included in ECCO-TCP as one file, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the Huntington Library. Celestina is included as four files, one for each of four volumes, based on the ECCO facsimile of an original from the British Library. Both works were first reproduced in the microfilm version produced 1982-2002 in by Research Publications,[^cf3] then digitized in 2003 (released on ECCO in June 2004), and finally published as TEI XML files in January 2007. The current files have been kept up to date with changes in TEI standards, and were created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl. The bibliographic metadata for these works is the same between ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records. In HathiTrust, however, the source text for The Emigrants is a University of California Library copy, rather than the British Library, scanned by Google Books, and presented with substantially less detailed bibliographic information. The ESTC, ECCO, and ECCO-TCP records for The Emigrants all provide the same physical description "ix,[3],68[i.e. 60]p. ; 4‚Å∞" with the same note"[n]umbers 9-16 omitted in pagination; text is continuous." HathiTrust, in contrast, gives the physical description "ix, 68 p. ; 26 cm," which is both more and less information: a quarto volume could be a range of sizes, so HathiTrust provides new detail by giving a measurement in centimetres, but the data on page numbers is now misleading. Consulting the HathiTrust facsimile shows that it, too, omits the page numbers 9-16, going directly from page 8 to page 17 without a break in the poem. HathiTrust also omits information on the three unnumbered pages between the preface and the poem. Evidently, a human did consult the book, to identify a nine-page preface in roman numerals, and the page number on the last page, but they did not carry out a full collation.

[^cf1]: Volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer are in fact part of the same bibliographic record as the first three volumes. The publication date for the combined five-volume work is listed as "1800-1802."

[^cf2]: Several of HathiTrust's records provide "mixed copies" like this, with some volumes scanned from one library's holdings and other volumes scanned at another. If there is overlap, multiple scans will be provided for the duplicated holdings. Nonetheless, all of these scans are tied to a single unified MARC record, taken from only one of the holding libraries (with no indication of which library provided it).

# Paper A: 3. case for lit of sensibility #

Can a serious case be made for the literature of sensibility on aesthetic and/or ethical and/or political grounds? Discuss at least three literary texts from your reading list in at least two different genres.

## intro ##

For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of “virtue in distress,” it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both “distress” and “virtue.” The literature of sensibility — which I take to encompass sentimental literature through its evolution into the gothic — is thus engaged in a constant negotiation regarding the failure points of its own convictions. The premise of sensibility is a valuation of feeling, but feeling easily amplifies distress and, when it conflicts with duty, impedes virtue.

## Wakefield (1766) ##

In The Vicar of Wakefield, feeling is used as an alternative value system to money. As the Primrose family grows poorer and poorer, this proves their love stronger and stronger. It is only money which conflicts with duty, never feeling, as when Primrose refuses to sign away his daughter’s reputation even to escape debtor’s prison. The novel thus articulates a kind of virtue which consists in endurance of and mental superiority to the attacks of others. The pleasure of this virtue comes in a sense of vindication. When Primrose converts his fellow prisoners, for example, the narrative emphasis is on how well he rises above their crude insults, rather than on his message; by contrast with Hannah More, we can see that the focus is on the pleasure of a comfortable reader identifying with Primroses’s persecution, rather than on persuasively presenting correct opinions. After extensively discussing the fact that virtue’s rewards are all in the afterlife and not on earth, the novel enters a rapid reversal-of-fortunes phase that is almost as dramatic as the preceding thirty chapters of escalating misery: Sir William Thornhill arrives as a messianic figure who has been watching the Primrose family in moral guise and will now administer wide-reaching justice. The more difficult ethical lesson in the novel is its mercy: its religious message defers all punishment to the afterlife, and holds that no one is past reform, and so its final reversal of fortune is very mild for the novel’s former tyrants. Although the novel was initially successful on these aesthetic terms, as its definition of “virtue” lost its persuasiveness, it soon began to seem embarassingly over-earnest to readers, so much so that many critics now read it as a satire of the sentimental views it espouses.

## Percy (1778) ##

When sentimental literature is attached to the marriage plot, the conflict is no longer between feeling and money, but between feeling and familial duty. In Percy, the message of The Vicar of Wakefield — that virtue has its rewards in futurity, and usually incurs greater distresses on earth — is presented without an escapist reversal of fortune at the end. At the outset of the play, Elwina has submitted to her duty uncomplainingly, and married a man to whom she is indifferent, but her husband attempts to demand that she love him, too. As in The Vicar of Wakefield, the most effective balm for distress is a knowledge of one’s own virtuous superiority. However, the outcome of this marriage of duty perhaps explains why the lovers in The Sicilian Lover are so eager to murder hordes of infants rather than betray their vows to each other: feeling is the one thing which cannot be commanded, and Elwina’s virtue is insufficient to save those whom she loves. Instead, her triumph is to actually die rather than compromise herself. The pleasure in her virtue comes in her vindication, as the men who cruelly constrained her admit aloud the impossibility of her position and praise her resistance. As a play, Percy addresses a society rather than an individual sufferer: as such, its concluding moral is a warning to tyrants not to overstep their powers.

## Simple Story (1791) ##

In A Simple Story, feeling must battle both money and duty. Inchbald tries to work out how one is supposed to go about acquiring the mental resources necessary to discipline feeling, and reaches the disheartening answer that is cannot be done without distress. The novel’s decidedly un-simple two-part structure depicts a sentimental love story that results in a gothic one. The story appears to promise the reform of a sensible, fashionable woman into the happy wife of a sensible, refined gentleman: their high-strung feelings lead them into misunderstandings and difficulties of various sorts, but with the intervention of a friend they acknowledge their love to each other and, with no conflicting duties, this leads immediately to a marriage. However, in the gap between volume two and volume three, seventeen years elapse, in which our flighty heroine lacks the mental resources to deal with boredom and has an affair, and our stern hero lacks the mental resources to master his grief and becomes a tyrant. In the second go-round, the young orphan is raised in terrified solitude, hiding from her father in her own house, and Matilda, unlike Miss Milner, learns “to suffer like a heroine”; the appropriate pastimes are to stay at home, feeling ill-done-by by one’s guardians, and read novels. Udolpho will in a few years teach Emily that the appropriate response to tyranny is submission, but not appeasement; Matilda learns this lesson too. The gothic education she recieves serves her well enough to form a sedate, friendly attachment to her cousin and to concede to a marriage when he asks for it. It is hard to feel entirely comfortable with this marriage, especially with Percy in mind, but the novel assures us that we have “every reason to suppose that their wedded life, was—a life of happiness.” Responses to the novel often say that it confusingly lacks a moral, because its moral is so contradictory to expectations: Miss Milner’s father would have done better to have left her poor; wealth is not respectable on its own; in other words, like Dr Primrose, we ought to rush off to debtor’s prison at the first opportunity and refuse all temptations to leave. This moral is made fairly explicit, but is also conceptually rejected out of the sense that surely Inchbald can’t have meant that — though it is no less than what Jesus says. Again, as in both Wakefield and Percy, the knowledge of one’s own virtue is the greatest pleasure in life, and submission to tyranny the best way to acquire it.

## The Captive (1803) ##

This discussion of virtue and distress allows a complex discussion of Matthew Lewis’s challenging monodrama, The Captive. The play overwhelms because it uses the systems of sensibility to engage its audience’s feelings at the highest pitch, and then destroys the accepted systems of that framework. The eponymous heroine is at the peak of sensible distress: imprisoned in physical distress like Dr Primrose, misbelieved like Elwina, mistreated by someone who is meant to care for her like Matilda. Her virtue, in this context, seems self-evident through her distress. She employs her mental resources to confirm her superiority to her circumstances; she recalls her familial ties. But her attempt to disavow her circumstances begins to slide into delusion. And then, after a highly metaphotical/aestheticized ‘fading hope’ moment watching a fading light, her performance is interrupted with violence. The moment responsible for the majority of the fainting suring the performance appears to be, essentially, a jump scare: the madman is dragged away, the captive relaxes, and then he suddenly reappears in a different part of the stage — presumably with a dramatic sting of music and a bright light. This sudden fear is not the kind of distress which sensibility can resist; the captive and the audience both are too sensitized. The captive’s madness is not an aesthetic, vindicated madness like Elwina’s; it is not borne of inner conflict or her situation; it is a bodily experience which her distress has left her too weak to resist. Even the dumb-show ending, which attempts to present a restoration of familial connection and social norms, can’t erase the knowledge of that irrational, overwhelming fear. And thus it is “too horrible for representation”: it cannot be aestheticized into an ethical experience, dealing as it does with distress which virtue cannot resist.

## conclusion ##

Submission may not appeal to contemporary readers as a virtuous response to distress. On its own, it smacks of too little justice; but if a deus ex machina supplies the justice, this feels unsatisfyingly unrealistic. Submission is also certainly politically distateful; it is no surprise that the two religious writers are much more successful at providing the comforts of submission than radical Inchbald and “Monk” Lewis. To say that the literature of sensibility constitutes a sustained engagement with the aesthetics and ethics of submission to authority may not, therefore, constitute a serious case “for” these texts. But in their central acknowledgement of feeling, they supply a crucial lack in enlightenment discourses on virtue. And in their provision of narrative vindication, they can provide supreme pleasure to the readers who buy their premise.

# Paper B: 5. what is lost in distant reading #

What is to be lost by distant reading? Ground your answer in both theory and practice, with reference to at least three literary texts from your reading list.

## intro: lose inviolability ##

What ought to be lost in distant reading, I argue, is the sense of a text’s inviolability. Many other things can be, and have been, lost in past distant readings — notably, attention to textual provenance — but these do not have to be lost. Something does have to be lost in any model of a text: as Willard McCarty astutely outlines, models are useful because they don’t perfectly replicate that which they model. But an individual human’s memory of a text, or a set of quotations copied out in a group, are models too, which lose the wholeness of the text in service of human limitations. In many ways, distant reading simply chooses what to lose, and attempts to choose astutely, in accordance with the question at hand, so that the resulting model will simplify away the less-relevant-right-now details in exchange for greater sensitivity to the details under examination. Making these choices means letting go of the idea of the text as an object separate from one’s own study of it. Whatever one is attempting to read — whether it is one text or one thousand — one must hard-code the choices one makes about how to read. This requires getting tangled up and messy with one’s object of study; it means, ironically, no longer maintaining a polite distance.

### also lose focus on 3 texts ###

It is, of course, possible to distant-read invidual texts — I have done it often — but distant reading is at its most exciting when it uses its distance to bring more objects into view simultaneously than can easily be considered at once using other methods. Accordingly, one thing which distant reading also loses is the assumption that questions are answered with reference to three texts. But the classic “compromise position” for distant-reading — which does have its virtues — is to serve, essentially, as a slick new “finding aid” for more traditional research. Therefore, I have turned my attention to the canon of Romanticism as it is currently constructed, to seek the texts most crucial for a close-read comparison.

## anthologies ##

My model of the contemporary canon is taken from three anthologies of Romanticism: Norton, Longman, and Broadview. I examined the tables of contents of all three anthologies, calculating the number of pages devoted to each author, with some details on which works are included. Bettina Fischer-Starcke says that the most important things in linguistics are also the most common. Evidently, Romanticism is 12% Wordsworth by volume. He only barely edges out Byron, who also rounds to 12%. Wordsworth, Byron, Percy Shelley, Coleridge, Keats, and Mary Shelley together account for half of Romanticism; everybody else combined constitute the other half. This is, of course, the “big six” with William Blake pushed aside (to 8th place, just after Mary Wollstonecraft) in favour of women who wrote works that are longer and less visual.

### tokenism - cut Dorothy ###

This model is not meant to surprise, but it does, I think, highlight the uncomfortable strategies necessary to reconcile a broadening canon with the “parade of authors” structure of canon. To counteract the promulgation of a masculinist Romanticism, the concrete manifestation in an anthology is the inclusion of “nearby” women. The frequent anthologization of Dorothy Wordsworth, for example, strikes me as misguided: the Grasmere and Alfoxden journals are fascinating documents, but they are also private, not constructed as literature. It seems to me to do Dorothy Wordsworth a severe disservice to primarily edit and anthologize the journal entry where she describes an experience her brother later writes into a poem, and the journal entry where she writes feelings so private that she crossed them out, which one editor deems Dorothy to have judged “not even for William’s eyes” — in the same sentence as describing the X-ray technology used to read them anyway. In anthologies, these extracts are too obviously included for William’s sake, not for Dorothy’s.

### tokenism - CSmith rocks ###

Similarly, but with the opposite tendency, Charlotte Smith’s inclusion always near Wordsworth — in the Longman anthology, embedded among the Lyrical Ballads as “context” for Wordsworth — gives the entirely false impression that she is interesting primarily for her impact on Wordsworth, rather than as a crucial Romantic poet in her own right. As Knowles and Horrocks point out, Smith was at the centre of the English literary canon in 1798 when Lyrical Ballads was printed — her Elegiac Sonnets had just entered its eighth edition in 1797, now expanded to two volumes. In one almost shocking piece of praise, she was described as being better than Milton. Smith’s disappearance from our awareness was part of a process of deliberate forgetting in the early nineteenth century, so successful that even Victorian women explicitly seeking poetic forbears had no knowledge of her.

## The Thorn ##

Wordsworth’s and Smith’s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards their public reputation, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, “The Thorn” and “On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.” Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a similar moral superiority to salacious gossip. The reader can understand, as the speaker of the poem cannot, the metaphorical resonance why which the thorn is Martha Ray, harmfully dragged to the ground by lichens like the poem’s speaker himself who cheerfully relates every scrap of speculation which he has heard, and wishes he had more. Michael Gamer has astutely described how Wordsworth, in this poem, benefits from the public taste for supernatural and miserable tales, while crafting a serious reputation in opposition from the materials he uses. The poem’s speaker, too, disavows his sources and attempts to disdain them, even as he embellishes them with his own imagined details and claims the tale as a whole as a story which he, despite his status as a traveller, has the distinct right to tell.

## On being cautioned ##

In contrast, Smith’s “On being cautioned” positions her poetic persona as not only the recipient of an alarming tale, but one who pursues that tale intentionally. Some readings of this poem make much hay out of the fact that Smith’s encounter with the eponymous lunatic is imagined, but I note that nowhere does she say that the caution she has been given is successful. One can easily read the poem as describing her continued walk toward the precipice. Even if Smith herself did not go, it is in keeping with the poetic persona by which she sold her work to imply that she did. Where Wordsworth attempts to remain “above” the narratives and feelings he sells, Smith embraces her status as the purveyor of sadness, and therefore dramatizes the incident into as direct an encounter as possible. Smith’s poetry is highly-crafted, of course, as the sonnet form demands, but through her craft she cultivates an emotional embrace of direct experience which contrasts strongly with Wordsworth’s distancing aestheticization.

## no power law ##

But anthologies are not the only place to look for Wordsworth’s peers. If we return to the anthology as a model of Romanticism, but this time consider a graph instead of a chart, it is immediately notable that the distribution of pages by author does not follow a power-law distribtuon. Most natural phenomena (and many human phenomena) show a power-law distribution, in which the most frequently-appearing items appear exponentially more than the less frequent items. In any given written work, for example, the most-frequent word (usually “the”) will appear roughly twice as often as the second-most-frequent word, which is itself twice as common as the third-most-frequent word. For Byron to be nearly identical to Wordsworth in prevalence, rather than half Wordsworth, is clear proof that anthologies are selected according to criteria other than naturally occurring frequency.


## ESTC ##

That anthologies have selection criteria is not meant to be a surprise, either. But I thought it would be informative to compare the list against a less-curated body of texts. My point of comparison comes from data I have accumulated for my dissertation: the titles of roughly 52,000 words printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799. These titles, then, constitute the public world of letters in the decade leading up to the publication of Lyrical Ballads. Interestingly, this collecton of texts also does not show a power-law distribution, but. If we include unsigned works, they dominate the corpus so strongly that we diverge from the power-law in the opposite direction: they represent far more than twice the next “author”. But of course, not all unsigned works are written by Mr. Null, so if we really want to know the most-published individual author, we can exclude them. This time we have three behemoths, all different forms of regular government publications, the third of which also far more than doubles the fourth place author (who, incidentally, is King George III — still the government, but reduced to human scale.) If we exlude all works whose “authors” include “Great Britain” or “England” in their names, we at last see something like the list of individual writers which we hoped for — but no names which take up prominence in anthologies of Romanticism.
Of course, this decade is before the full flourishing of Romanticism — if I examined, instead, years during which Don Juan was being published, it is possible that Byron would be visible. But it is also the case that, as William St. Clair has excellently demonstrated, Wordsworth intentionally sought to differentiate his work and its methods of sale from the mass pamphlet production which puts Thomas Paine and Hannah More at the top of this list.

## Robert and Richard ##

Wordsworth’s intentional avoidance of mass print, however, does not prevent us from reading “The Thorn” again against another poem making use of gothic materials: Hannah More’s “Robert and Richard, or, the ghost of poor Molly, who was drowned in Richard’s mill pond.” More promises a ghost in the title of this Cheap Repository Tract, likely knowing that it would be competing for sale with other ghost stories among the chapbook hawkers that she used to distribute her Cheap Repository Tracts. More often uses titles in order to attract what she considers “bad readers” toward good texts in disguise; her series “The Two Shoemakers,” for example, often makes promises about the ill doings of Jack Brown in prison, to compete with popular true crime narratives, and her evangelical tract “The Cottage Cook; Or, Mrs. Jones’ Cheap Dishes” could easily have been mistaken for one of her actual cook books. Similarly, the ghost in “Robert and Richard” is relegated to the sidelines of a rhyming song about Richard who laughs off his misdeeds with “what harm is in this?” and Robert who reminds him to “remember the end.” When Molly appears, she is seduced, impregnated, abandoned, and mysteriously found drowned with her baby in the eponymous mill-pond in about X lines. She then rapidly haunts Richard into an early death. But the conclusion of the poem returns its attention to Robert, who mourns his friend’s misdeeds and death, and erects a tombstone for him with a moralizing epitaph. More, like Wordsworth, uses the marketability of ghost stories to sell her readers on moral improvement, but although she does her selling far more explicity, she delivers far fewer actual gothic thrills. The ghost is present, but More dedicates no poetic attention to making her spectral appearance scary or even interesting, in striking contrast to the haunting image of the baby’s reflected face in “The Thorn.” As a counter to popular superstition, then, More’s work is far more in accordance with her stated aims than Wordswoth’s. When Wordsworth made his ballads into lyrical ballads [is The Thorn a ballad?], comparison with Smith and More shows, he claimed a popular working-class form, disavowed the original speakers of his material, and placed his creation intentionally out of reach of the people he profited from disdaining.

## conclusion ##

More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her “Strictures on Female Education” appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and “Sorrows of Yamba” in two for the section on slavery, and even “Village Politics” appears in Longman. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of “Robert and Richard” on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But if Dorothy Wordsworth were removed, and Charlotte Smith moved from the “context” section to Dorothy Wordsworth’s vacant “author” space, something like an actual contemporaneous ballad could be placed alongside William Wordsworth. This editorial change is highly speculative, but represents one possible amendation to the small and highly clustered network of “notable” writers which I argue is to be lost with distant reading.

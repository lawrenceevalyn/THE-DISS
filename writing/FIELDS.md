# Paper A: 3. case for lit of sensibility #

Can a serious case be made for the literature of sensibility on aesthetic and/or ethical and/or political grounds? Discuss at least three literary texts from your reading list in at least two different genres.

## intro ##

For a work to successfully provide the pleasurable aesthetic experience of “virtue in distress,” it must articulate compelling ethical definitions of both “distress” and “virtue.” To be compelling, these definitions must both resonate with the audience’s expectations of the world, and chart some feasible path through their conflicts. The premise of sensibility is a valuation of feeling, but, as the literature of sensibility expresses, intense feeling easily amplifies distress and, when it conflicts with duty, impedes virtue. The literature of sensibility — which I take to encompass sentimental literature through its evolution into the gothic — is thus engaged in a constant negotiation regarding the failure points of its own convictions. A detailed examination of individual works’ navigation of these tensions, and of the mental pleasures they offer to readers, may not constitute a “serious” case, but, following Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski, it attempts a feeling case.

### they're trying to work out a value system ###

They’re all trying to work out a value system that can serve as a viable alternative to money and rationalism, placing family ties and feeling at the centre. And then bouncing off the limits of that value system.

## Wakefield (1766) ##

### not a satire ###

Although the novel was initially successful on these aesthetic terms, as its definition of “virtue” lost its persuasiveness, it soon began to seem embarassingly over-earnest to readers, so much so that many critics now read it as a satire of the sentimental views it espouses.

### feeling against money ###

In The Vicar of Wakefield, feeling is used as an alternative value system to money. As the Primrose family grows poorer and poorer, this proves their love stronger and stronger. Despite its escalating cavalcade of miseries, which to modern readers take on a comic tone in their excesses, the novel presents no conflict. It is only material comfort which conflicts with duty, never feeling, as when Primrose refuses to sign away his daughter’s reputation even to escape debtor’s prison, thus making Primrose’s path to virtue always clear to him. Accordingly, even as he complains that he is too old and injured to journey through the snow to debtor’s prison in the middle of the night, he instructs his family to prepare for their relocation as quickly as possible, confident that he has identified the only correct course of action and eager to pursue it immediately.
Some of Primrose’s most stirring sermons, in favour of the monarchy in chapter 20 and against capital punishment in chapter 27, lay out extended critiques of wealth. His argument for the monarchy is particularly unusual: its overall tone is jocular, but its central insight is compelling. “It is the interest of the great,” he argues, “to diminish kingly power as much as possible; because whatever they take from that is naturally restored to themselves.” Rather than improving the life of the common people, increasing the power of individual citizens creates a system “where the laws govern the poor, and the rich govern the law.” The accumulation of wealth is inherently suspect, both requiring and creating tyranny.

### virtue is endurance ###

The novel thus articulates a virtue which consists in an embrace of and mental superiority to the attacks of others. The more stirringly one articulates the wrongs one endures, the greater one’s virtue is in submitting to these wrongs without resistance. The presence of extensive complaint without action — indeed, while actively working against the actions taken on his behalf by, for example, the parishoners who wish to prevent his being jailed — is easily critiqued as ineffective, but passive submission is not meant to be useful in preventing harm. In a sermon to his fellow prisoners in chapter 20, Primrose declares, “Yes, my friends, we must be miserable. No vain efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature,” and stirringly describes the archetypal “wants” which literary imagination cannot make disappear. He preaches an embrace of misery, rendered endurable by the knowledge that one will be vindicated in the end by cosmic justice.

### pleasure of superiority (prison) ###

The novel then proceeds to provide all of the pleasures and rewards which it has lectured readers not to expect. The satisfaction of vindication and the comfort of material security flood into the narrative in a reversal of fortune as easy to laugh at as Primrose’s original accumulation of miseries. Satisfaction arrives first: Primrose has always had confidence in his own moral uprightness, but as he begins to convert his fellow prisoners, he can enjoy the acknowledgement of his virtue. The narrative emphasis in his conversion scene is on his personal nobility, rather than his message: in chapter 27, he describes in extensive detail four different tricks played upon him by prisoners who mock his sermon, and assures us that he “took no notice of all that this mischievous group of little beings could do,” but none of the sermon itself is included. 
This prison conversion scene is thus of a very different nature than the one in Hannah More’s The Two Shoemakers, which begins with a character’s insistence that he is not going to give a sermon, but then delivers a detailed religious message. The differing emphasis reinforces Wakefield’s distance from the sufferings it claims to provide a solution to: More’s Cheap Repository Tracts, if they did not circulate within prisons, were certainly intended to reach those for whom prison was a very near concern — whereas the sermon Goldsmith does include in chapter 27 is a philosophical argument for legislative reform of the prison system, aimed at those who cause rather than endure imprisonment.

### reversal of fortune ###

Where the main body of the novel saw, for example, Primrose’s son dragged into prison bloody and fettered while Primrose is mid-sentence expressing delight that this son remains the only family member secure from harm, the conclusion struggles to shove in all their resolutions. In one particularly dense moment, Primrose descibes that “We now sate down to dinner, which was almost cold; but previously, my arm still continuing painful, Sir William wrote a prescription, for he had made the study of physic his amusement”: the dinner, intended as a resolution for their acute hunger, has been delayed by the arrival of a daughter reported to be dead, and the narrator can barely remember the order in which lucky happenstances cure his ills.
Sir William Thornhill arrives as a messianic figure who has been watching the Primrose family in mortal guise and will now administer wide-reaching justice. This resolution, too, prioritizes readers’ comfort by narratively delivering the rewards which are meant to be delayed.

### mercy ###

The more difficult ethical lesson in the novel is its mercy: its religious message defers all punishment to the afterlife, and holds that no one is past reform, and so its final reversal of fortune stymies any thirst for revenge among its readers. The con man who financially ruined Primrose’s family, when discovered as a fellow prisoner, is promptly forgiven and embraced as a friend despite his lack of repentance. Squire Thornhill, who has tyrannized the Primrose family for most of the novel, is initially exposed and mocked — his lackeys tell him to his face how much they dislike him, and his uncle humbles and disciplines him — but rather than being utterly ruined, he is sent to the country to live as the companion to a relative, “being very well liked,” amusing his melancholy cousing, and “learning to blow the French-horn.” As a narrative comeuppance this resolution is lacking. Most strikingly, Primrose hints that “when he reforms” his daughter, his legal wife, “she may be brought to relent.”

## Simple Story (1791) ##

### need distress to gain mental resources ###

In A Simple Story, Inchbald tries to work out how one is supposed to go about acquiring virtue, and reaches the disheartening answer that is cannot be done without distress.

### sentimental fails ###

The novel’s decidedly un-simple two-part structure depicts a sentimental love story that results in a gothic one. The story appears to promise the reform of a sensible, fashionable woman into the happy wife of a sensible, refined gentleman. Together they bear up under the distresses of their marriage plot by virtue of their deep feeling. Miss Milner, in particular, is attentively monitored for signs of vice, but demonstrates obedience by refraining from forbidden amusements, even when her guardian-lover Dorriforth has abandoned his trust in her. However, in the gap between volume two and volume three, they are undone by their respective vanity and temper, not reformed after all.
The characters’ mistake seems to have been an unwillingness to face their acknowledge the strength of their feelings, which prevents them from responding to them appropriately, and leads them into complicated and uncomfortable deceptions. When Miss Milner avows a false passion for Lord Frederick, or when Dorriforth very nearly marries the blank and dutiful Miss Fenton, for example, they spend weeks in miserable confusion. Dorriforth’s constant refrain is “How am I to accomplish her wishes? What am I to do? How can I judge, if she will not confide in me, but thus for ever deceive me?” (II.III)
Chapter one of volume three recounts the fact of their transformations breathlessly, but with no interest in “the progression by which vice gains a predominancy in the heart”: they lack the crucial mental resources to resist their respective boredom and anger, and thus they are doomed to take on the roles of the gothic mother who dies rejected and the gothic father who tyrannizes his daughter.

### gothic more successful ###

Despite the many moments of satisfying vindication that their heightened feelings brought to them, Inchbald’s narrative suggests, something is unsound in the foundations of their principles. The concluding moral informs us that Matilda succeeds where her mother failed becuse Matilda has a “proper education,” but her story is extremely similar.
The gothic education she recieves serves her well enough to form a sedate, friendly attachment to her cousin and to concede to a marriage when he asks for it. It is hard to feel entirely comfortable with this marriage, especially with Percy in mind, but the novel assures us that we have “every reason to suppose that their wedded life, was—a life of happiness.”


#### suffer like a heroine ####

Critics often draw attention to the domestic tyrannies Dorriforth inflicts on Miss Milner in the first half, his tests of obedience and his enraged outburts, as a translation of his later tyranny rendered on a domestic scale to make it more identifiable in readers’ own lives. His daughter Matilda must navigate the same tyrant. 
Unlike Miss Milner, however, she is “Educated in the school of adversity, and inured to retirement from her infancy, she had acquired a taste for all those amusements which a recluse life affords.” In other words, Matilda, unlike Miss Milner, learns “to suffer like a heroine,” as Udolpho will define the task a few years later. Emily St. Aubert’s education in Udolpho shares with A Simple Story a conviction that excess of feeling is dangerous. In tension with this mistrust of feeling, however, is the tightrope Emily walks in her carefully-measured submission to her circumstances. Early in her imprisonent in the castle of Udolpho, Emily attempts to persuade her aunt to give in to Montoni’s demands. All Montoni has demanded is her money; to give in would not betray her virtue. Her aunt resists, and dies as Emily predicts; when Emily herself is offered the same choice, she signs the papers given to her by Montoni, in exchange for her freedom to live in what the narrative deems poverty in France. Montoni, however, has no incentive to uphold his promise, and Emily no power to resist him. From this point, Emily’s strategy becomes one of outer meekness but inner resistance, enduring her distresses by frequent retreat to soothing views and other distractions, but always refusing to cede ground within her own mind. The impenetrable final boundary of the mind is a valuable retreat for the gothic heroine at the height of distress: more than one heroine has made it to the very altar of a forced wedding, her only comfort her own refusal to say “yes” aloud.
A gothic education in the school of adveristy, then, prepares Matilda to be emotionally self-sufficient with astonishingly little care shown toward her from her guardians, and to temper her obedience with 
If it works, it works not because Matilda and Rushworth do something different — it works because they both, and especially Matilda, now have such lowered expectations that the same outcome constitutes a greater satisfaction for both of them.

### striking message in favor of distress ###

Responses to the novel often say that its conclusion is ambiguous or confusing, because its most obvious conclusion is unpalatable.
Like Wakefield, Simple Story presents a critique of wealth which can extend to a disavowal of the possession of wealth itself: “What is it makes wealth valuable? Is it the pleasures of the table? the pleasure of living in a fine house? or of wearing fine cloaths? These are pleasures, a Lord enjoys, but in common with his valet. It is the pleasure of being conspicuous, which makes riches desirable; but if we are conspicuous only for our vice and folly, had we not better remain in poverty?” 
And indeed, the final lines are not entirely sanguine that full happiness is possible, but explictly ties its optimism to a rejection of wealth:
“what may not be hoped from that school of prudence—though of adversity—in which Matilda was bred?
And Mr. Milner, Matilda's grandfather, had better have given his fortune to a distant branch of his family—as Matilda's father once meant to do—so that he had given to his daughter
A PROPER EDUCATION”

Janet Todd says “surely misfortune is not the kind of ‘proper education’ that Inchbald would recommend a father to provide for his daughter,” but the evidence provided suggests that, even if one would not wish to pursue distress, experiencing it is the the only way to form a strength of character. To acknowledge and fully experience unpleasant feelings and circumstances is the only healthy response to them. Like Dr Primrose, we ought to run, not walk, to debtor’s prison.

### conclusion ###

And so again, as in both Wakefield and Percy, the knowledge of one’s own virtue is the greatest pleasure in life, and submission to tyranny and distress the best way to heighten that pleasure. Indeed, in A Simple Story, it seems possible that distress is the only way to acquire that virtue in the first place. And again, the case for the literature of sensibility is its ability to present a distinctly other moral system.

## The Captive (1803) ##

This discussion of virtue and distress allows a complex discussion of Matthew Lewis’s challenging monodrama, The Captive. The play overwhelms because it uses the systems of sensibility to engage its audience’s feelings at the highest pitch, and then destroys the accepted boundaries of that framework. The eponymous heroine is at the peak of sensible distress: imprisoned in physical distress like Dr Primrose, [misbelieved like Elwina], mistreated by someone who is meant to care for her like Matilda. Her virtue, in this context, seems self-evident through her distress. She employs her mental resources to confirm her superiority to her circumstances; she recalls her familial ties. But her attempt to disavow her circumstances begins to slide into delusion. And then, after a highly metaphotical/aestheticized ‘fading hope’ moment watching a dimming light, her performance is interrupted with violence. The moment responsible for the majority of the fainting during the performance appears to be, essentially, a jump scare: the madman is dragged away, the captive relaxes, and then he suddenly reappears in a different part of the stage — presumably with a dramatic sting of music and a bright light. This sudden fear is not the kind of distress which sensibility can resist; the captive and the audience both are too sensitized. The captive’s madness is not an aesthetic, vindicated madness like Elwina’s; it is not borne of inner conflict or her situation; it is a bodily experience which her distress has left her too weak to resist. Even the dumb-show ending, which attempts to present a restoration of familial connection and social norms, can’t erase the knowledge of that irrational, overwhelming fear. And thus it is “too horrible for representation”: it cannot be aestheticized into an ethical experience, dealing as it does with distress which virtue cannot resist.

### presents a wrong kind of distress ###

### other works let audience practice ###

The previous works provided a safe ground within with their audiences can practice embracing misery, and have that misery vindicated and comfortably resolved. The Captive betrays that trust.

## conclusion ##

Submission may not appeal to contemporary readers as a virtuous response to distress. On its own, it smacks of too little justice; and if a deus ex machina supplies the justice, this feels unsatisfyingly unrealistic. Submission is also certainly politically distateful; it is no surprise that the two religious writers are much more successful at providing the comforts of submission than radical Inchbald and “Monk” Lewis. To say that the literature of sensibility constitutes a sustained engagement with the aesthetics and ethics of submission to authority may not, therefore, constitute a serious case “for” these texts. But in their central acknowledgement of feeling, they supply a crucial lack in enlightenment discourses on virtue. And in their provision of narrative vindication, they can provide supreme pleasure to the readers who buy their premise.

# Paper B: 5. what is lost in distant reading #

What is to be lost by distant reading? Ground your answer in both theory and practice, with reference to at least three literary texts from your reading list.

## intro: lose inviolability ##

What ought to be lost in distant reading, I argue, is the sense of a text’s inviolability. Many other things can be, and have been, lost in past distant readings — notably, attention to textual provenance — but these do not have to be lost. Something does have to be lost in any model of a text: as Willard McCarty astutely outlines, models are useful because they don’t perfectly replicate that which they model. But an individual human’s memory of a text, or a set of quotations copied out in a group, are models too, which lose the wholeness of the text in service of human limitations. In many ways, distant reading simply chooses what to lose, and attempts to choose astutely, in accordance with the question at hand, so that the resulting model will simplify away the less-relevant-right-now details in exchange for greater sensitivity to the details under examination. Making these choices means letting go of the idea of the text as an object separate from one’s own study of it. Whatever one is attempting to read — whether it is one text or one thousand — one must hard-code the choices one makes about how to read. This requires getting tangled up and messy with one’s object of study; it means, ironically, no longer maintaining a polite distance.

### also lose focus on 3 texts ###

It is, of course, possible to distant-read invidual texts — I have done it often — but distant reading is at its most exciting when it uses its distance to bring more objects into view simultaneously than can easily be considered at once using other methods. Accordingly, one thing which distant reading also loses is the assumption that questions are answered with reference to three texts. But the classic “compromise position” for distant-reading — which does have its virtues — is to serve, essentially, as a slick new “finding aid” for more traditional research. Therefore, I have turned my attention to the canon of Romanticism as it is currently constructed, to seek the texts most crucial for a close-read comparison.

## anthologies ##

My model of the contemporary canon is taken from three anthologies of Romanticism: Norton, Longman, and Broadview. I examined the tables of contents of all three anthologies, calculating the number of pages devoted to each author. Bettina Fischer-Starcke says that the most important things in linguistics are also the most common. Evidently, Romanticism is 12% Wordsworth by volume. He only barely edges out Byron, who also rounds to 12%. Wordsworth, Byron, Percy Shelley, Coleridge, Keats, and Mary Shelley[^cf1] together account for half of Romanticism; everybody else combined constitute the other half. This is, of course, the “big six,” but with William Blake pushed aside (to 8th place, just after Mary Wollstonecraft) in favour of women who wrote works that are longer and less visual.

### tokenism - cut Dorothy ###

This model is not meant to surprise, but it does, I think, highlight the uncomfortable strategies necessary to reconcile a broadening canon with the “parade of authors” structure of literary history. To counteract the promulgation of a masculinist Romanticism, the concrete manifestation in an anthology is the inclusion of “nearby” women. The frequent anthologization of Dorothy Wordsworth, for example, strikes me as misguided: the Grasmere and Alfoxden journals are fascinating documents, but they are also private, not constructed as literature. It seems to me to do Dorothy Wordsworth a severe disservice to primarily edit and anthologize the journal entry where she describes an experience her brother later writes into a poem, and the journal entry where she writes feelings so private that she crossed them out, which one editor deems Dorothy to have judged “not even for William’s eyes” — in the same sentence as describing the X-ray technology used to read them anyway. In anthologies, these extracts are too obviously included for William’s sake, not for Dorothy’s.

### tokenism - CSmith rocks ###

Similarly, but with the opposite tendency, Charlotte Smith’s inclusion always near Wordsworth — in the Longman anthology, actually embedded among the Lyrical Ballads as “context” for Wordsworth — gives the entirely false impression that she is interesting primarily for her impact on Wordsworth, rather than as a crucial Romantic poet in her own right. As Knowles and Horrocks point out, Smith was at the centre of the English literary canon in 1798 when Lyrical Ballads was printed — her Elegiac Sonnets had just entered its eighth edition in 1797, now expanded to two volumes. In one almost shocking piece of praise, she was described as being better than Milton. Smith’s disappearance from our awareness was part of a process of deliberate forgetting in the early nineteenth century, so successful that even Victorian women explicitly seeking poetic forbears had no knowledge of her.

## The Thorn ##

Wordsworth’s and Smith’s similarities and crucial differences, particularly as regards their public reputation, play out in two of their emblematic, always-anthologized poems, “The Thorn” and “On being cautioned against walking on a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a lunatic.” Wordsworth’s “The Thorn,” famously, attempts to depict the sharing of rumours and folk-tales while remaining morally elevated above the circulation of such things, and inculcating in the reader a similar moral superiority to salacious gossip. The reader can understand, as the speaker of the poem cannot, the metaphorical resonance by which the thorn is Martha Ray, harmfully dragged to the ground by lichens like the poem’s speaker himself who cheerfully relates every scrap of speculation which he has heard, and wishes he had more. Michael Gamer has astutely described how Wordsworth, in this poem, benefits from the public taste for supernatural and miserable tales, while crafting a serious reputation in opposition to the materials he uses. The poem’s speaker, too, even as he embellishes the tale with his own imagined details and claims the whole as a story which he, despite his status as a traveller, has the distinct right to tell, disavows his sources and attempts to disdain them.

## On being cautioned ##

In contrast, Smith’s “On being cautioned” positions her poetic persona as not only the recipient of an alarming tale, but one who pursues that tale intentionally. Some readings of this poem make much hay out of the fact that Smith’s encounter with the eponymous lunatic is imagined, but I note that nowhere does she say that the caution she has been given is successful. One can easily read the poem as describing her continued walk toward the precipice. Even if Smith herself did not go, it is in keeping with the poetic persona by which she sold her work for her to imply that she did. Where Wordsworth attempts to remain “above” the narratives and feelings he sells, Smith embraces her status as the purveyor of emotion, and therefore dramatizes the incident into as direct an encounter as possible. Smith’s poetry is highly-crafted, of course, as the sonnet form demands, but through her craft she cultivates an emotional embrace of direct experience which contrasts strongly with Wordsworth’s distancing aestheticization.

## no power law ##

But anthologies are not the only place to look for Wordsworth’s peers. If we return to the anthology as a model of Romanticism, but this time consider a graph instead of a chart, it is immediately notable that the distribution of pages by author does not follow a power-law distribution. Most natural phenomena (and many human phenomena) show a power-law distribution,[^cf2] in which the most frequently-appearing items appear exponentially more than the less frequent items. In any given written work, for example, the most-frequent word (usually “the”) will appear roughly twice as often as the second-most-frequent word, and three times as often as the third-most-frequent word, and so on. A power-law distribution is a particular kind of “long tail” graph, in which the few most frequent items have vastly more impact than the many less frequent items. For Byron to be nearly identical to Wordsworth in prevalence, rather than half Wordsworth, is clear proof that anthologies are selected according to criteria other than naturally occurring frequency.


## ESTC ##

That anthologies have selection criteria is not meant to be a surprise, either. But I thought it would be informative to compare the list against a less-curated body of texts. My point of comparison comes from data I have accumulated for my dissertation: the titles of roughly 52,000 words printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799. These titles, then, constitute the public world of letters in the decade leading up to the publication of Lyrical Ballads. Interestingly, this collecton of texts also does not show a power-law distribution. If we include unsigned works, they dominate the corpus so strongly that we diverge from the power-law in the opposite direction: they represent far more than twice the next “author”. But of course, not all unsigned works are written by Mr. Null, so if we really want to know the most-published individual author, we can exclude them. This time we have three behemoths, all different forms of regular government publications, the third of which also far more than doubles the fourth place author (who, incidentally, is King George III — still the government, but reduced to human scale.) If we exlude all works whose “authors” include “Great Britain” or “England” in their names, we at last see something like the list of individual writers which we hoped for — but now a much flatter curve, and no names which take up prominence in anthologies of Romanticism.
Of course, this decade is before the full flourishing of Romanticism — if I examined, instead, years during which Don Juan was being published, it is possible that Byron would be visible. But it is also the case that, as William St. Clair has excellently demonstrated, Wordsworth intentionally sought to differentiate his work and its methods of sale from the mass pamphlet production which puts Thomas Paine and Hannah More at the top of this list.

## Robert and Richard ##

Wordsworth’s intentional avoidance of mass print, however, does not prevent us from reading “The Thorn” again against another poem making use of gothic materials: Hannah More’s “Robert and Richard, or, the ghost of poor Molly, who was drowned in Richard’s mill pond.” More promises a ghost in the title of this Cheap Repository Tract, likely knowing that it would be competing for sale with other ghost stories among the chapbook hawkers that she used to distribute her Cheap Repository Tracts. More often uses titles in order to attract what she considers “bad readers” toward good texts in disguise; her series “The Two Shoemakers,” for example, makes promises about the ill doings of Jack Brown in prison, to compete with popular true crime narratives, and her evangelical tract “The Cottage Cook; Or, Mrs. Jones’ Cheap Dishes” could easily have been mistaken for one of her actual recipe collections. Similarly, the ghost in “Robert and Richard” is relegated to the sidelines of a rhyming song about Richard who laughs off his misdeeds with “what harm is in this?” and Robert who reminds him to “remember the end.” When Molly appears, she is seduced, impregnated, abandoned, and mysteriously found drowned with her baby in the eponymous mill-pond in eight lines. She then rapidly haunts Richard into an early death. But the conclusion of the poem returns its attention to Robert, who continues warning his friend away from drink and gambling, and then mourns his friend’s misdeeds and death. The ghost passes away without a trace — “she wept, and she groan'd, and she vanish'd in air” — but Richard’s tale is preserved for posterity in a tombstone erected by Robert, with a moralizing epitaph which concludes the poem. More, like Wordsworth, uses the marketability of ghost stories to sell her readers on moral improvement, but although she does her selling far more explicity, she delivers far fewer actual gothic thrills. The ghost is present, but More dedicates no poetic attention to making her spectral appearance scary or even interesting, in striking contrast to the haunting image of the baby’s reflected face in “The Thorn.” As a counter to popular superstition, then, More’s work is formally more in accordance with her stated aims than Wordswoth’s. When Wordsworth made his ballads into lyrical ballads, comparison with Smith and More shows, he claimed a popular working-class form, disavowed the original speakers of his material, and placed his creation intentionally out of reach of the people he profited from disdaining.

## conclusion ##

More has not been entirely excluded from anthologies: her “Strictures on Female Education” appears in two anthologies as contextual matter for Mary Wollstonecraft, and “Sorrows of Yamba” in two for the section on slavery, and even “Village Politics” appears in Longman. And indeed, it is hard to argue for the inclusion of “Robert and Richard” on the grounds of its poetic beauties. But if Dorothy Wordsworth were removed, and Charlotte Smith moved from “context” to Dorothy Wordsworth’s vacant “author” space, something like an actual contemporaneous ballad could be placed alongside William Wordsworth. This editorial change is highly speculative, but represents one possible amendation to the small and highly clustered network of “notable” writers which I argue is to be lost with distant reading.


[^cf1]: Footnote Shelley

[^cf2]: Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So word number N has a frequency of 1/N.
	Thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. For example, in one sample of words in the English language, the most frequently occurring word, "the", accounts for nearly 7% of all the words (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word "of" accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by "and" (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the sample of words.
	The same relationship occurs in a wide range of other rankings, unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, and income rankings.

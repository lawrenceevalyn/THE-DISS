The ESTC, therefore, excludes volumes 4 and 5 of Letters of a Solitary Wanderer (1802), three works for children (Conversations, Introducing Poetry, 1804; History of England, 1806; and Natural History of Birds, 1807), and the posthumous publication that now forms a major part of Smith’s reputation as a poet, Beachy Head (1807).

<p class="itemText">In 1980, the ESTC began to go online.  “One implication of the publication history of short-title catalogues is that they have been deemed functional and valuable even before they were complete.

Judging that even a preliminary form of the records was useful to scholars, the planners of ESTC determined to conduct its development ‘in full public view.’” Accordingly, the in-progress database was made a...</p>

At the end of 2010, they launched the Google Ngram viewer, as a research tool borne of all their scanning. Meanwhile, however, their legal court case continued, and scanning began to slow in 2012.

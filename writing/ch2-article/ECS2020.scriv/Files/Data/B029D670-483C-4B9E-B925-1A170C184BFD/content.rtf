\f0\fs22 \cf0 Computational distant reading of eighteenth century texts has much less emphasis on text mining than other eras. \'93Text mining\'94 is a broad term for digital methodologies which examine the full texts of works under study: techniques like topic modelling and stylometry, for example, rely on having a machine-readable digital surrogate of the text\'92s contents. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has not traditionally been able to handle eighteenth century typefaces, so text-mining research relies on hand-encoded texts. Encoding text manually is incredibly labor intensive. }

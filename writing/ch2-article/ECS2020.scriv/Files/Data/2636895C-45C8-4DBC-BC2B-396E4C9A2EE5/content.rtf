\f0\fs22 \cf0 [Despite the impression they give of always being \'91up to date\'92, digital resources often reflect much earlier conceptions of that imagined whole.] [It has now been more than thirty years since feminist criticism started having major successes in 18thC studies.] [ECCO began in 2003, well after figures like Charlotte Smith had been \'91recovered.\'92] [But the microfilms underlying ECCO date from the 1980s: so ECCO might easily reflect 1980s priorities about what kinds of works are work investing in and redistributing.] [Charlotte Smith offers an interesting case study in a \'91successful\'92 recovery project. This allows me to ask: to what extent do research infrastructures \'91lag behind\'92 scholarly consensus? No eighteenth centuryist is now likely to say that Smith is irrelevant or unimportant to the period. In the infrastructure of literary canons as described by Guillory, she has certainly succeeded: she is given prominent space in all anthologies of Romantic literature; she regularly appears on introductory syllabi, including surveys of all British literature; there are scholarly editions, and seminars, and dissertations, conference panels, and every other sign that she is an important and valued writer. But what about digital infrastructures? Are they \'93up to date\'94? For many I would say, not really.]}

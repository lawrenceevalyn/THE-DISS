\f0\fs22 \cf0 The relocation of the debate from the canon to the corpus, on the surface of it, is not without grounds. Challenges to the technological accessibility of texts have created new hierarchies, and a new \'93great unread.\'94 Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to 
\i do
\i0  with texts. [However, what we learn from these case studies, of Charlotte Smith and of the 1790s at large, is that the decisions made about inclusion and exclusion from digital databases simply do not mirror the decisions made in syllabi or anthologies.]}

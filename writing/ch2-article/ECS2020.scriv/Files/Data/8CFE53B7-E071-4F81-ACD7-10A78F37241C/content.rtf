The initial number for women, of course, is extremely low: a mere 3%. This is far below the percentage of women found in genre-specific surveys. For example, During the years 1789-99, 20.2% of the new novels written in England were attributed to female names on their title pages and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://0FFFED76-F2E0-4952-9DF5-C8D789F50EB7"}}{\fldrslt prefaces.}} [The ESTC and ECCO have a lot of medical texts, sermons, natural histories, legal opinions, and other genres from which women are de factor excluded.] [HathiTrust\'92s slight increase in female authorship might show a collections-level bias where university libraries prefer slightly more interesting or recognizably \'93literary\'94 materials like novels, poetry, and drama, all of which allowed for female authorship.] But even if the TCP were assumed to contain exclusively novels, at 22% female authorship it would be statistically overrepresenting women. [The TCP is the one operating based on the most recent decision-making (since even HathiTrust is constrained to the library collecting decisions of past decisions, and thus doesn\'92t necessarily reflect the priorities of 2000s ]}

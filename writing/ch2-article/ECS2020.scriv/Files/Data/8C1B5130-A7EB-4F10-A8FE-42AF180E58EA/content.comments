\f0\fs24 \cf0 The category of works \'93identifiably by men\'94 includes named authors with male first names (e.g., John), semi-unsigned authors whose author attribution clearly signalled male authorship (e.g., \'93Mr. R\'94), and pseudonyms which similarly must apply to men (e.g., \'93a country clergyman\'94). It excludes authors identified only by their initials, even when a subject expert could match those initials to a specific individual of known gender (e.g., W.H. Ireland).}]]></Comment>

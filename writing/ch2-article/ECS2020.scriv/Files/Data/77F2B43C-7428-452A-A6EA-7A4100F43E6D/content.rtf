\f0\fs22 \cf0 Women made up a nearly negligible portion of the titles published in England during the 1790s. If one were to choose a title at random, it would be more likely to be written by a man named John than by a woman. But we do not choose titles at random\'97 even in large-scale digital humanities research. We neglect the genres from which women are most strongly excluded: medical texts, legal texts, sermons, and other discourses tied to specialized (male) occupations. We prefer fiction and poetry, the forms most open to women. Even then, we overrepresent women. I want to be very explicit that the overrepresentation of women is not inappropriate: it strikes me as a very positive sign that we might have grown less sexist in the intervening two hundred years. Instead, what this work shows is that the logic of \'93representation,\'94 which underpins discussion of literary canons and syllabi, is not a good fit for understanding the infrastructural impact of contemporary digital databases.\

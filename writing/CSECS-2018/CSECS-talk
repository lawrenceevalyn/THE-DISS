This is mostly a talk about how difficult it is to find out what's actually in a digital archive. Because it's digital, we expect accessibility/convenience, but often what digitality actually enables is a black box. The goal of my work, which is still extremely preliminary, is to take a small enough slice of "big data" that I can actually examine it carefully, and to scrutinize it.

My work as a digital humanities scholar right now 


data collection
even though "MARC" stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue," at points I read these records with my feeble human eyes

titles per year
- this was unreasonably difficult to make; OpenRefine was the secret
- TCP is the most unbalanced -- though that may be because it also includes Evans texts

publisher location
ESTC shows more published in Edinburgh than in Scotland
(210 Edinburgh, 52 Scotland)
Neither of these includes Ireland right now -- ESTC because it's not in my query, ECCO because I deleted Ireland to match ESTC

ECCO stats are based on the 37,830 MARC records which include publisher location
Somewhat inexplicably, 27,140 MARC records don't include bibliographical publisher assessment, just a transcription of the title page
(I also have 25,000 more MARC records than I expected so I have some more correlating to do.)

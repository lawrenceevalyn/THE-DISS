\f0\fs22 \cf0 The naive hypothesis, investigating a historical phenomenon, is that factors like systemic sexism are likely to have an effect. As I have shown in chapter two, the digital archives currently used by eigtheenth-century scholars were created during their own historic moments, which influenced their priorities as texts were digitized. Resources which provide more information about particular works \'97 such as ECCO, which provides PDF scans of microfiche, or the TCP, which provides detailed XML-encoded transcripts \'97 inevitably provide their more thorough information about fewer texts. The ESTC is able to include so many works in its database in part because it includes so little about each work: little more than the information found on the title page, and a list of libraries where the original can be consulted. As the more resource-intensive archives created their digital surrogates, therefore, the texts they include are likely to be less indiscriminate, and more strongly influenced by a personal assessment of what works are most important. In many other areas, writing by women has been dismissed as less important or worthy of serious study than writing by men. If we compare the holdings of major digital archives, do the smaller and more resource-intensive archives show evidence of systematically opting not to invest in women\'92s writing?}

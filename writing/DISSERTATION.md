Title: DISSERTATION
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

## background ##







This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as contemporary writers anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. With more writers and more readers entering the conversation, it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a ‘whole.’ My MA research sought to contextualize the Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe in terms of the masses of their now-forgotten peers on the shelves of circulating libraries. [I was particularly interested in assessments of male and female gothics, because of my supervisor Robert Miles.] My examination of the plot information recorded in two bibliographies of the Gothic revealed that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of ‘Male Gothic’ novels which presented horrifying stories not to be found in works by women. However, this method could reveal no corresponding subject matter that was the sole province of women in the several hundred novels assembled, and instead revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the ‘school of Radcliffe.’ For my dissertation, I will follow the same pattern of comparing key authors to large bodies of their peers, without trying to isolate a singular, self-contained field of ‘the Gothic.’



## driving research Qs ##







[I want to find practical ways forward to] to cope with the “great unread” of literature, and to marry large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will particularly seek ways to account for the real variety within [works produced during] the chronologically narrow period 1789-99. [there is no “average” or “normal” text against which the “exceptional” works can contrast, nor can any text be “representative.”] [Nonetheless, I will iteratively prototype models of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape.] [Each model will try to [render tractable] the complex interactions between the broad generic traditions of prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and to identify how particular writers have made use of these interactions in their works.] [One model will be large and distant: 52,001 bibliographic entries from the English Short Title Catalogue.] [One model will be smaller and closer: 2,188 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus.] [And one model will be a “traditional” approach: closely reading and re-reading key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period to further both aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.]



## methods ##



### model 1: ESTC ###







The English Short Title Catalog lists 52,001 works printed in England during this decade. [The ESTC has already agreed to provide me with their database entries, which will have [X] kinds of information.] [I will do some things looking at all of these, like Lahti et al. who looked at 50,766 works categorized as history.] [I will also look in more detail at some subsets of these works, like Zwicker who examined a random sample of 500.]



### model 2: ECCO-TCP ###







I will also assemble a relational database of information about the full range of literary works produced in my chosen chronological period, and as many digital texts as I can find. The three corpora I already possess — the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus (2,188 texts from 1701-1800), the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing (46 texts 1723-1830), and my own collection of Gothic novels listed in Ann Tracy’s index (122 texts 1790-1830) — provide a foundation to which I will add texts from collections like Women Writers Online, the Oxford Text Archive, and from digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. The ECCO-TCP corpus will likely account for a substantial percentage of the resulting collection, but by seeking a diversity of sources I hope to create a body of several hundred texts representing a unique range. 



 I am comfortable with enough computational approaches to allow for flexibility: stylometric analysis of word choice; statistical correlation of bibliographical details; topic-modelling classification of texts according to a defined ontology; and network-map visualizations of textual prose similarity. I can select between and adapt these approaches based on the questions and limitations that emerge from my text-collection process. 



### model 3: reading ###



## critical context ##



## conclusion ##







Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my case study writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers? 



# Special Fields list rationale #







Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religous, as well as several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’

# Ch 1: Introduction #







An Introductory Chapter – Tell the reader the problem you are tackling in this project. – State clearly how you aim to deal with this problem. – Limit the scope of your study. – Sketch out how the thesis is structured to achieve your aim.



## Context ##







Context of the Study – Provide a brief history of the issues to date. – Situate your particular topic within the broad area of research. – Note that the field is changing, and more research is required on your topic.



## Problem statement ##







 Problem Statement (or Motivation for the Study) – Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context). – Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters. – Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigation.



### Research questions ###







My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?



How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?



How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?







do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially? How different are the writers and audiences for each medium? I also anticipate finding new insight into the forms and popularity of political writing in the period: how much of the work being consumed is presented with explicit political aims? What mediums are most-used for different political positions? In a somewhat separate line of inquiry, I will explore in-depth the works of the individuals authors under consideration: how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? 



Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my key writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers? 



## Aim and scope ##







Aim and Scope – Be sure that your aim responds logically to the problem statement. – Stick rigorously to a single aim. Do not include elements in it that describe how you intend to achieve this aim; reserve these for a later chapter. – When you have written the conclusions to your whole study, check that they respond to this aim. If they don’t, change the aim or rethink your conclusions. – If you change the aim, revise the motivation for studying it. – Be sure to establish the scope of your study by identifying limitations of factors such as time, location, resources, or the established boundaries of particular fields or theories.

## Significance ##







Significance of the Study – Explain how your thesis contributes to the field. – There are four main areas of contribution: theory development, tangible solution, innovative methods, and policy extension. One of these contributions must be identified as the basis of your primary contribution to the field. – In contrast to reports for industry, theory development is an expected and required contribution; for PhDs in particular, it must be ‘original’.



## Structure of the thesis ##







Overview of the Study (or Structure of the Thesis) – Sketch out how the thesis is structured. Don’t confine yourself to a list of the chapters, but show how they are linked and that one section logically leads to another. – Check whether the reader can see from this sketch how the aim will be achieved.



----



# Ch 2: Background #







Background Chapters – Include in these chapters all the material required to lead up to your own work. – Ensure that there is a flow of narrative that explains why each topic is being discussed.



## transition ##



### link to prev. chapter ###







First paragraph: creates a link back to the earlier parts of the thesis, in particular the previous chapter, to make it obvious why the chapter is needed.



### aim of this chapter ###







Second paragraph: states the aim of the chapter, what the reader learns from it and how it advances the overall goal.



### how I'll achieve this aim ###







Third paragraph: outlines how you intend to achieve this aim. This paragraph often has the ‘overview of contents’ flavour that so many writers think constitutes an introduction. But it is only one part of the introduction, and without the other two parts the reader struggles for a sense of direction. (Incidentally, writers sometimes literally give it as a table of contents. This is far from helpful. The reader needs to know not only what you will be dealing with in the chapter, but also the logical connection between the various sections.)

What’s in it? How did I make it?



What does it tell us about what was ‘normal’ during my decade?

# Ch 7: Synthesis / Discussion #







 Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.







Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.



# Ch 8: Conclusion #







Connecting discussion and conclusions: • Your conclusions are what your discussion chapter has been arguing for. • You could write the conclusions to your whole study as the last section of a chapter called ‘Discussion and Conclusions’, but it is usually preferable to have a separate ‘Conclusions’ chapter. • If they form a separate chapter there should be no conclusions to the discussion chapter, and you should inform the reader of this in the discussion. Rules about conclusions: • You should draw your conclusions solely from the discussion chapter. • There should be little further discussion in the conclusions chapter. • The conclusions should respond to the aim stated in the first chapter. • Summaries are not conclusions. • Conclusions should be crisp and concise. • The conclusions can be used to briefly explore the implications of your findings.

Title: DISSERTATION
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

# Proposal #



## background ##







This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as contemporary writers anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. With more writers and more readers entering the conversation, it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a ‘whole.’ My MA research sought to contextualize the Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe in terms of the masses of their now-forgotten peers on the shelves of circulating libraries. In particular, guided by my supervisor Robert Miles, I was interested in challenging generalizations made from those two authors into distinct male and female schools of writing. My examination of the plot information recorded in two bibliographies of the Gothic revealed that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of ‘Male Gothic’ novels which presented horrifying stories not to be found in works by women. However, this method could reveal no corresponding subject matter that was the sole province of women in the several hundred novels assembled, and instead revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the ‘school of Radcliffe.’ For my dissertation, I will follow the same pattern of comparing key authors to large bodies of their peers, without trying to isolate a singular, self-contained field of ‘the Gothic.’ Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the mediascape as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.



## driving research Qs ##







This decade study seeks to cope with the “great unread” of literature, and to marry large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will iteratively prototype multiple models of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will try to render tractable the complex interactions between the broad generic traditions of prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and to identify how particular writers have made use of these interactions. One model will be large and distant: 52,001 bibliographic entries from the English Short Title Catalogue. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership corpus. And one model will occur at a more “traditional” scale: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period to further both aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. All three models will be pursued simultaneously, to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.



## critical context ##











This dissertation enters into an ongoing shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century literature as a whole. It resists, both, the history of the novel as a teleological path to realism, and the history of Romanticism centred on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of, for example, Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also enters into theoretical gestures toward “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, as part of a broader attempt to move away from paranoid modes of criticism, as discussed by Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. “Distant reading” as per Franco Moretti is thus used as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. The particular computational approaches developed through the research process are likely to contribute novel computational techniques to the field of the digital humanities, but these techniques are not the primary motivating concern.



## methods ##



### model 1: ESTC ###







The English Short Title Catalog (ESTC) has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti et al., examining similar basic bibliographic information for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale, which I will use to look for influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see Ann Racliffe as an increasingly popular author, reflected in multiple reprints of her works, with the ‘school of Radcliffe’ visible in the titles of works following her success. I will also look in more detail at some subsets of these works. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. Through these general descriptive efforts, I will assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of generic forms within the mediascape. As I engage with the content of works being published, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works appear to be politicized, and how openly they carry their political agendas.



### model 2: ECCO-TCP ###







I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during my decade of interest. I may also supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing, Women Writers Online, the Oxford Text Archive, and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to compare how each models the decade. I am particularly curious to see how the relative prominense of my key authors may look different through this different approach. Then I will examine the texts themselves, to see what intertextual relationships they reveal. Through my stylometric analysis, I will seek to identify and contextualize the characteristic language of my key authors, and particularly to see if any of them are outliers.



### model 3: reading ###







Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few key authors in detail. I seek to understand the individual idiosyncratic relationship Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson each had with the public sphere of letters, and how each strategically employed different generic forms. Reading these authors, with these questions in mind, is also a ‘model’ of the decade, and a procedural practice of inquiry. To take full advantage of the affordances of my close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attentively examine fascimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions of some works’ entry into the literary circulation. As I read these works I will pursue the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices, which in my use generally involve small handmade indexes, timelines, and visualizations.



## conclusion ##







Although these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 have been described in sequence, they will be researched in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each model occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be said to be “representative” of this decade? And what do they “represent”?

# Special Fields list rationale #







Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’

# Ch 1: Introduction #







An Introductory Chapter – Tell the reader the problem you are tackling in this project. – State clearly how you aim to deal with this problem. – Limit the scope of your study. – Sketch out how the thesis is structured to achieve your aim.



## Context ##







Context of the Study – Provide a brief history of the issues to date. – Situate your particular topic within the broad area of research. – Note that the field is changing, and more research is required on your topic.



## Problem statement ##







 Problem Statement (or Motivation for the Study) – Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context). – Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters. – Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigation.



### Research questions ###







My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?



How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?



How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?







do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially? How different are the writers and audiences for each medium? I also anticipate finding new insight into the forms and popularity of political writing in the period: how much of the work being consumed is presented with explicit political aims? What mediums are most-used for different political positions? In a somewhat separate line of inquiry, I will explore in-depth the works of the individuals authors under consideration: how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? 



Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my key writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers?



What texts should we teach to students? And how should we contextualize them?



(Step 1 is to be true to the variety of the period, but also true to its chief emphasis.)



## Aim and scope ##







Aim and Scope – Be sure that your aim responds logically to the problem statement. – Stick rigorously to a single aim. Do not include elements in it that describe how you intend to achieve this aim; reserve these for a later chapter. – When you have written the conclusions to your whole study, check that they respond to this aim. If they don’t, change the aim or rethink your conclusions. – If you change the aim, revise the motivation for studying it. – Be sure to establish the scope of your study by identifying limitations of factors such as time, location, resources, or the established boundaries of particular fields or theories.

## Significance ##







Significance of the Study – Explain how your thesis contributes to the field. – There are four main areas of contribution: theory development, tangible solution, innovative methods, and policy extension. One of these contributions must be identified as the basis of your primary contribution to the field. – In contrast to reports for industry, theory development is an expected and required contribution; for PhDs in particular, it must be ‘original’.



## Structure of the thesis ##







Overview of the Study (or Structure of the Thesis) – Sketch out how the thesis is structured. Don’t confine yourself to a list of the chapters, but show how they are linked and that one section logically leads to another. – Check whether the reader can see from this sketch how the aim will be achieved.

# Ch 2: Background #







Background Chapters – Include in these chapters all the material required to lead up to your own work. – Ensure that there is a flow of narrative that explains why each topic is being discussed.

### link to prev. chapter ###







First paragraph: creates a link back to the earlier parts of the thesis, in particular the previous chapter, to make it obvious why the chapter is needed.



### aim of this chapter ###







Second paragraph: states the aim of the chapter, what the reader learns from it and how it advances the overall goal.



### how I'll achieve this aim ###







Third paragraph: outlines how you intend to achieve this aim. This paragraph often has the ‘overview of contents’ flavour that so many writers think constitutes an introduction. But it is only one part of the introduction, and without the other two parts the reader struggles for a sense of direction. (Incidentally, writers sometimes literally give it as a table of contents. This is far from helpful. The reader needs to know not only what you will be dealing with in the chapter, but also the logical connection between the various sections.)

# Ch 6: Synthesis / Discussion #







 Synthesis – You are now ready to pull the whole thesis together. – Discuss the implications of your results. – Draw strong conclusions backed up by your discussion. – Check that they respond to the aim stated in your introduction.







Structuring your discussion: • The task of the discussion chapter is to enable you to reach your conclusions. Drawing up a tentative list of conclusions will help you identify an appropriate structure. • Begin by writing down all the things you know now that you didn’t know when you started the project. Rearranging this list will give you the titles of the main sections of your discussion. Summary of Chapter 9: The Discussion or Interpretation  119 Checking the thesis structure: • Before you start writing material in each of these sections, check your thesis structure by stringing together introductions and conclusions for all the chapters. • Check that the tentatively structured thesis responds to the aim and scope you set yourself in your introductory chapter. Write with authority: • Make sure that your exposition of new theory or ideas places your thesis within the context of the field you are working in. This will require that you not only draw on your own results, but that you view these against existing thinking as expounded in your background chapters. • Acknowledge any limitations on your findings. Theoretical results may need validation before their suitability in practice is known, for example. Shortcomings or uncertainties should also be acknowledged. • If the thesis involves a case study, check that you have dealt with the problem of generalizability, or issues of transference, for your findings to similar situations.



# Ch 7: Conclusion #







Connecting discussion and conclusions: • Your conclusions are what your discussion chapter has been arguing for. • You could write the conclusions to your whole study as the last section of a chapter called ‘Discussion and Conclusions’, but it is usually preferable to have a separate ‘Conclusions’ chapter. • If they form a separate chapter there should be no conclusions to the discussion chapter, and you should inform the reader of this in the discussion. Rules about conclusions: • You should draw your conclusions solely from the discussion chapter. • There should be little further discussion in the conclusions chapter. • The conclusions should respond to the aim stated in the first chapter. • Summaries are not conclusions. • Conclusions should be crisp and concise. • The conclusions can be used to briefly explore the implications of your findings.

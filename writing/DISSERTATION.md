## Intro ##



### intro to overall argument ###



This dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like. It also seeks to explain, in equally minute detail, why this task of historical recovery is, in fact, impossible. [FLESH OUT MY ACTUAL ARGUMENT AND TOPIC]



### many definitions of DH ###



The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological. [ADD A COUPLE DEFINITIONS OF DH HERE]. These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.” Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life. [ADD SOME DIGITAL CULTURAL STUDIES STYLE DEFINITIONS HERE]. This kind of work is increasingly described as “digital cultural studies.” In positioning this work as a “DH” dissertation, I might at first glance seem to belong squarely within the “computational humanities.” To be sure, much of this work is intended to apply existing computational methodologies to conduct otherwise old-fashioned literary research. Several of my contributions, too, are purely methodological in nature, in the development of new code and new guidelines for computational research using particular digital resources. However, as a fuller discussion of Johanna Drucker’s distinction between “data” and “capta” will elucidate later in this chapter, no computational research exists separately from a specific, local, culturally-defined context. Accordingly, my computational research into eighteenth century literature and my development of new computational methodologies are both inevitably tied to “digital culture.” My results often have more to say about contemporary digital archives, and the history of literary record-keeping, than they do about the eighteenth century itself. I therefore rely on an extensive body of work in cultural digital studies to examine not only the eighteenth century, but eighteenth century studies.



### many histories of 1790s ###



So, too, are there many “histories” — or perhaps, narratives — available to describe the 1790s. [FOCUS ON POLITICS]. [FOCUS ON ROMANTICISM]. [FOCUS ON GOTHIC]. Of necessity, each of these histories must exclude something. [WHAT EACH EXCLUDES].



#### rise of the novel ####



### reparative reading ###



It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia. [SUMMARIZE SEDGWICK AND REPARATIVE READING]. Rita Felski, in her recent monograph The Limits of Critique, expands on Sedgwick. [SUMMARIZE FELSKI]. Sedgwick is often critiqued for painting a much clearer picture of the paranoid mode than the reparative mode, leaving it unclear how one is meant to escape paranoia’s double-bind. But this is not to say that the attempt itself is unworthy. [CONCLUSION HERE].



### BLUF ###



These, then, are the three scholarly conversations to which this dissertation contributes: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the theoretical frameworks within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the two experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.



## DH ##



### many histories of DH ###



When telling a history of “DH,” one has many histories to choose from, all freighted with different implications for contemporary practice. [TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF DH]. [FEMINIST HISTORY OF DH.] As these competing historiographies show, [CONCLUSION TO THIS PARAGRAPH.]



### code is not neutral ###



The central contention of my computational praxis is that, despite the aura of empirical truth which accrues to some ‘scientific’ methodologies and discourses, nothing is neutral/objective. As Johanna Drucker argues, “data” is not neutral/objective. As Sophia Noble demonstrates, algorithms are not neutral/objective. As Wendy Chun reveals, computational technologies are not neutral/objective. As Alberto Cairo shows, graphs and charts are not neutral/objective. [FIND SOMEBODY TO SHOW THAT TOOLS LIKE VOYANT ARE NOT NEUTRAL — is this Chun?.] [PUT THESE IN ORDER ACCORDING TO FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS] Each of these is constructed, by humans, for human purposes, constrained by human biases. As the humanities have long known, of course, things need not be neutral/objective to be meaningful or valuable. By setting aside the desire for a singular neutral/objective truth, we can instead draw quite close to the messy multitudes of truths which enable insight. Accordingly, [CONCLUSION].



### my methods ###



This dissertation will, nonetheless, make use of digital tools, algorithms, “data”, and data visualizations to carry out its inquiry. At every possible point, however, the underlying methodology will be made visible, and its assumptions scrutinized. Much of the code underlying this project I have written myself. Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A, accompanied by a plain-language explanation of how it operates. Where I have used closed-source software, Appendix A contains an explanation of my best guess at its underlying process. My exact use of these tools — sufficient for another to replicate my work — is provided in Appendix B. These details are explicated in full in the appendices in order not to over-burden the body of the dissertation, but they are by no means confined to the appendices. [CONCLUSION].



### capta ###



My attention to the sources of digital knowledge creation comes from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” [EXTENDED SUMMARY OF DRUCKER.]  [records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, captured, rather than neutrally “given.”] [EXAMPLE DATA FROM MY MATERIALS] [Conclusion: ??]



### critical algorithm studies ###



If, as Drucker establishes, “data analysis” is already doomed to [MESSINESS?] from the moment of data capture, [SOMEHOW ALSO TRANSITION TO THE ALGORITHMS MAKE USE OF THAT DATA.] The emerging field of critical algorithm studies thus responds to an urgent need. [Extended summary of Sophia Noble]. [Write about Wendy Chun too] [EXAMPLE ALGORITHM FROM MY MATERIALS] [Conclusion: I am indebted to the ‘digital cultural studies’ scholars for giving me tools/lenses for my work….?]



### procedural argument ###



An additional and perhaps-unexpected resource, for scrutinizing algorithms critically, comes from the work of those who study games, especially video games. [Ian Bogost argues that procedures contain arguments.] This framework allows us to see that all research methodologies, including non-digital ones, contain implicit arguments about the nature of what is studied. [EXAMPLE PROCEDURE FROM MY MATERIALS - something non-computational?] 



### fruitful models/samples ###



In light of the challenges of “empiricism,” my goal in this dissertation is to produce a series of fruitful models. [Willard McCarty on models] Another way of expressing this might be to borrow from the vocabulary of social science research: I would like to make discoveries about a “population” which is inaccessible to me, namely, “everything printed in England 1789-99.” Since I cannot access this population in full, I have taken a series of “samples,” which I hope to be representative; each sample can be examined as evidence of the makeup of the source population, but must also be examined in and of itself as a sample. [therefore, not attempting ‘accuracy’] [Rather than making claims about the 1790s each claim is filtered through / constrained by the specific model of the 1790s used to make it] Rather than producing a clear and pristine truth, my models are, in fact, quite likely to contradict each other. In these moments of contradiction, [we have the best opportunity to learn, because we can see why they contradict, and therefore why something may or may not be true.] [These opportunity are “fruitful”] [Expand on “fruitfulness”]



### data viz ###



[Transition: it’s part of my contention that one can actually learn and know things; I will be trying to communicate those things in part through charts!] [Drucker again: charts are misleading, humanities approaches to graphical display] [I am making my own charts] [In doing so, I owe a debt to Tufte] [I will also explain my charts, using Cairo’s vocabulary of framework; visual encoding (content); annotations]. [CONCLUSION]



## 1790s ##



### English history ###



All of these [capta, samples, algorithms, models, and self-reflective methodologies — match preceding section] do have an aim beyond themselves: to recapture, in as minute detail as possible, the print landscape in England between January 1 1789 and December 31 1799. This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799.[^cf1] In England, [HISTORY OF THE KEY EVENTS OF THIS DECADE IN ENGLAND]. [CONCLUSION: an environment which felt like it was on the edge of history]



### superlatives ###



The [world of letters? Public sphere? What do I call it?] in England responded to these events by [writing WAY TOO MUCH]. This is the decade of Common Sense, it is the decade of Lyrical Ballads; it is the decade of Hannah More, it is the decade of Ann Radcliffe; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. Charles Dickens’ now-famous superlative degree of comparison [MATCHES LITERARY HISTORY TOO.] Each literary ‘mode’ was imbued with the potential for national importance. [WRITE ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF READING/WRITING TO NATIONAL IDENTITY —> CONCLUSION.]



### canons ###



Not coincidentally, the 1790s are also a decade in which some literary “canons” begin to take form, adjudicating between the “right” and “wrong” literatures. [The big one is the gothic!] [EJ Clery] [Michael Gamer] [But these aesthetic debates take on higher stakes due to the political context: corresponding societies] [also somehow Hannah More!!] [it is not neutral, there will be competing narratives, we must accept them all?]



#### John Mee's book ####



John Mee silently defines “print, publicity, and popular radicalism” as being synonymous with the activities of the London Corresponding Society, and societies like it. These societies and their use of print are obviously crucial parts of the print landscape, reflecting one [take on] publicity, but I seek to go broader.



#### "schools of thought" ####



my own understanding of eighteenth century politics as “schools of thought” governed by memetic natural selection.

Because politics occurs between individual people, not political parties, I argue that political affiliation, like literary genre, is not amenable to simple taxonomic classification.



### more similar than different ###



All of these schools of writing are, I argue, more similar than they are distinct, in the print marketplace of the 1790s. Which is to say, all of these individual writers are choosing strategies from the same pool of constrained choices. [Gothic strategies - Gamer] [Corresponding society strategies] [Poetic strategies - Mary Robinson] [Hannah More] [CONCLUSION: have to deal with everything at once; individuals, variety]



### conclusion ###



My synthesizing approach [SAYS SOMETHING THAT WRITING PREVIOUS PARAS WILL CLARIFY]



## theory ##



### reparative reading ###



On the broadest level, my primary theoretical framework is that of reparative reading. I understand reparative reading to mean [DEFINITION OF REPARATIVE READING]. Others have worked to carry out scholarship in this mode, including [OTHER REPARATIVE READERS]. [SUMMARIZE THE MAIN THREADS / CATEGORIES OF THEIR WORK.] [WHY I VALUE REPARATIVE READING (INDEPENDENT OF DH & 1790s)].



### queer theory ###



Latent in [<- LESS PARANOID PHRASING?] my prioritization of reparative reading is an affinity for queer theory more broadly. I take it as read, for example, that [history consists of major discontinuities in individual psychology/ontology, as Foucault describes.] [I follow Judith Butler in understanding these historically-[constrained] identities as being “performative,” actively re-created in conversation between self and others.] [(In my understanding of performative identity creation I also borrow from J.L. Austin, who is not typically understood as a ‘queer theorist,’ but who contributes an invaluable articulation that [WORDS DO THINGS].)] [ALSO SUSAN SONTAG.] [This queer-theory foundation shapes my approach to literature as an encounter with an ‘other’, which, as Rita Felski says, [FELSKI HAS SOMETHING ON THIS]] [CONCLUSION.]



### surface reading ###



My search for other ways of relating to literature has also led me to emerging work under the umbrella of “surface reading”. “Surface reading” positions itself as an alternative to “symptomatic reading”; [RATHER THAN X, IT Y.] The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but also, I argue, overly simplistic: all paranoid reading is symptomatic, but not all symptomatic reading is paranoid. Reparative reading, as described by Sedgwick and potentially modelled by Felski, is still interested in ‘deep’ meanings of texts, in which striking textual features can be interpreted to locate additional meanings. [A LOT OF QUEER THEORY IS ALSO SYMPTOMATIC, EVEN WHEN IT’S NOT PARANOID (AND TBH IT’S OFTEN PARANOID).] In contrast, “surface reading” [DOES SOMETHING ELSE.] [GIVE EXAMPLES OF SURFACE READINGS.] [GROUP/CATEGORIZE SURFACE READINGS.] [CONCLUSION]



#### surface readers ####



### conclusion ###



Talk to Dana Seitler about the distinctions between surface reading and reparative reading

Reparative reading rejects paranoia & the role of the critic as master

	Felski rejects negativity? & role of critic?

Queer reading rejects ?

Surface reading interpretation (?) — focus on taking the text at its word & examining all details equally



## synthesis of 3 fields ##



### we need Venn ###



Drawing together three scholarly conversations with three distinct histories, it is difficult to attentively delineate the links and the tensions between each thread. Especially since many of these fields have, in fact, overlapped substantially, there is a danger of simplistically conflating distinct lines of thoughts. At the same time, over-emphasis on distinctions can overstate the separations between fields which do in fact (as the existence of this dissertation contents) share important affinities. To navigate these conceptual overlaps carefully, let us make our way through each area of an imagined Venn diagram of the three. We can discuss each pair in turn — DH and eighteenth century studies; eighteenth century studies and queer theory; queer theory and DH — to make our way toward the centre where all three overlap.



### DH & 1790s ###



#### DH & bibliography ####



In the intersection of the digital humanities and eighteenth century studies, I turn to bibliography. If there is any research more magnificent in its scope than [SOME BIG DH THING], it is work like Garside & Raven’s The English Novel. This kind of work seeks to be both comprehensive and accurate. [DESCRIBE THE SIMILARITIES I SEE. — Resources for future research] [Now I’m going to survey the kinds of digital corpora and non-digital bibliographic resources that I focus on.]



#### scholarly archives ####



Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scope. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. On the tip of anyone’s tongue, of course, is Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), containing [CONTENTS]. A subset of these texts have been hand-prepared, as part of the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), to be easier to study. The resulting corpus of ECCO-TCP texts contains [CONTENTS]. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), containing [CONTENTS]. These three digital collections [are the main ones.] [There are also two other kinds of digital archives: voracious mega-archives, and specialized micro-archives.]



#### mega archives ####



The best known mega-archive is, of course, Google Books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: [CONTENTS OF GOOGLE BOOKS]. [ERRORS IN GOOGLE BOOKS]. Nonetheless, Google Books is frequently used to study the prevalence of various “n-grams” (words or short phrases) over time. Similarly, Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly work.[^cf2] [CONTENTS OF PROJECT GUTENBERG.] Similar in scope to Google Books but with more limited research tools is the Internet Archive. [CONTENTS OF INTERNET ARCHIVE.] Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and the Internet Archive are not “canonical” sources of texts, but they are nonetheless part of the ecosystem of digital eighteenth century studies. Moreover, as in eighteenth century texts themselves, the boundary between “canonical” and “noncanonical” digital archives is a permeable one: Google Books is also being integrated into HathiTrust, [EXPLANATION OF HATHITRUST].



#### micro archives ####



Representing an entirely different set of assumptions about how digital archives ought to be formulated are what might be called “micro-archives,” which are micro largely in comparison to the hundreds of thousands or even millions of texts which comprehensive archives seek to include. Whereas the ‘main players’ can be easily enumerated for the mega-archives, these specialized collections are numerous. [EXAMPLES OF SPECIALIZED COLLECTIONS.] To go with their specialized focus, these small collections typically have an idiosyncratic relationship to the information they collect. [GIVE EXAMPLES]. By tailoring the structure of the archive itself to its specific materials, these collections [DO SOMETHING GOOD]. But they also [MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COMBINE THEM].

# THE DISS #



## proposal intro ##



Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99



My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape[ TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise …  ] in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives[ TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters – or can you?]. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices[ TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.]. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.



## ch 2 - archives ##



Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.



### intro ###



#### lit review ####



##### Lesser & Farmer debate #####



Do these citations with some kind of LaTeX to learn that process



A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer & Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.”



Blayney believes that Lesser & Farmer attempt to disprove his “one inescapable fact about printed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been” (7). But what really matters to him about identifying the “best-selling moneyspinners” of the day is not the ‘moneyspinning’ — the question of whether, when publisher bought a play, he was making a sound financial decision — but about the cultural centrality of ‘bestsellers’. The total market share of religious texts matters, not because it meant that publishers turned their highest profits off of religious texts, but because “[c]ustomers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other ‘literary’ publications,” evidence of “just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers” (7). Lesser and Farmer do not contradict the importance of religious texts to readers. But, in setting out “not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (F&L 213), they make the case that books with low market share, books that are not “best-selling,” could nonetheless be “moneyspinners.” Their rebuttal states that “...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low” (F&L 213), but what they leave somewhat unstated is: “in high demand” with whom?



My own work seeks to examine reprints, but in a more limited fashion than Farmer & Lesser were able to do. Rather than determine the reprint rate of various kinds of fiction, I carry out a Blayney-style examination of pure market share. I seek to identify reprints in order to determine the market share of new versus reprinted material in any given year. 



##### How do people determine popularity? #####



	1.	(Reprinting) Simon Bainbridge: best-selling, most-reprinted, most-adapted

	2.	(Assertion) George Taylor: simply asserts that some things are popular

	3.	(Assertion) Peter Murphy: despite promising that his study “examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history,” Murphy says NOTHING AT ALL about how well, to whom, for how much, etc etc things were sold.

	4.	(Performances) Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, et al.: number of performances per play (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory)

	5.	(Book history) Cronin: mostly asserts that people are “popular” or “celebrated”; with Erasmus Darwin, supports this by saying that the book The Botanic Garden is beautiful & expensive

	6.	(Editions, reprints, market share, profitability) Lesser & Farmer, Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade - “we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

	7.	(Market share) Blayney

	8.	(Title counts) MacLeod on the Minerva press — evaluates most popular authors & subgenres based on the number of “works published” or “titles” (unclear if this includes reprints)





##### popularity is actually impossible #####



It is not, in fact, possible to calculate 



Without [certain kinds of evidence], as F&L note, “we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books… if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists” (F&L 16)

Would need size of print runs and cost to produce, as well as sale price, and quantity sold.

[So it’s a little nonsense when people just say that something is popular]



##### Numbers to compare to #####



Comedies vs tragedies performed: the ratio of comedies to tragedies performed was an astonishing 14 to 1 in Paris (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory by Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, James P. McGregor, and Mark V. Olsen)



#### corpora ####



##### selection criteria #####



The full scope of my project is to grapple with every online database which contains at least 100 texts meeting my criteria: printed, in England, between the years 1789-99. 

I exclude databases of diaries or correspondence, since they are not printed. This has the effect of excluding single-author databases.



###### women's archives ######



I make an exception for archives which specifically seek to address gaps in archival holdings due to systemic bias, that is, three archives focused on women’s writing: Orlando, Chawton, and [I thought there was a third one].

For the most part archives are either comprehensive and have significantly more than 100 texts, or they are single-author / single-researcher focused, and thus have significantly less than 100. These kinds of reparative projects occupy the middle space.



##### these are all databases #####



The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)



What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.

A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.

Another approach is to ignore the categories and use things like topic modelling; relies on a more intimate knowledge of the information being studies (i.e., humanities expertise)



##### so what? #####



These basic factual questions, about what is in the various eighteenth century digital corpora that represent “mass” 18thC holdings for scholars, matter because []. Even though the specific numbers are likely to change as these digital holdings are continuously updated, my investigation of an archive “snapshot” matters because [they show how questions of fact can (and cannot) be answered?]



#### demographics ####



##### titles per year #####



##### men vs women vs unsigned #####



Can I identify male/female ratios?



### reprints ###



#### methods ####



Before I develop custom code, I establish some baselines by taking a random sample of 100 titles from each of my key corpora. I manually identify the original publication date of each title, and whether that title appears reprinted elsewhere in the corpus.



As I expand to algorithmically examine the full corpora, I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words “Xth edition.”

If this method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ (as determined by comparison to my random sample) I won’t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles?

Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching… unless it’s small enough for me to do manually (unlikely)



##### taking samples #####



First, I make sure the data is “clean” and comparable to all the others:

- Jan 1 1789 to Dec 31 1799

- ENGLAND ONLY, no Ireland or Scotland

- With ECCO, make sure I don’t have duplicate entries



I get a count of how many titles are in the corpus.



I use random.org to get 100 randomly-generated numbers. I use the “sequence” generator, not the “integer” generator.



#### sample: reprints ####



Compare most-reprinted texts overall to inclusions in smaller archives



ESTC

ECCO

ECCO-TCP



HathiTrust

ProQuest

BL 19thC



END?

WWO+Chawton combo?



Gutenberg

Book Tracker



Google Books??

Internet Archive?



#### sample: print runs ####



Take a random sample for which I attempt to locate size of print run



Radcliffe doesn’t need many editions because her print runs started out large — take a random sample and see if I can find print runs for the works

Compare the popularity order produced by raw edition count to the one normalized by print run — what’s the error rate?



Ask Tom how to find these numbers (it’s not in databases, but I can read a paper book! — This is one of the things that makes my methodology not 100% DH)



#### what's "normal"? ####



Computationally identify reprints in ECCO

Come up with a number that would be a "lot" of reprints vs "not a lot" (to gauge popularity generally)

How old were books, usually? (i.e., how long ago was their first edition)



#### close read: Paine vs WW vs Blake ? ####



Paine vs Wordsworth vs Blake? (Vs CSmith and Radcliffe?) How to accord importance to these writers is at the heart of much of this project.



#### close read: something old? ####



Any cool “1790s lit” not written in the 1790s? Shakespeare? Goldsmith?



### topics ###



#### methods ####



Develop some kind of ontology of topic that encompasses "everything" (sticking to 18thC frameworks of, e.g., history vs romance)



##### topic modelling #####



I turn to topic modelling as a way to move “laterally”: if I can only query attributes which every archive records, I can’t query anything at all.



#### sample: truthful titles ####



Take a random sample to see how accurate titles are to contents overall



#### compare archives ####



Count how many works of each topic appear in each archive -- what kinds of content has been excluded in each, esp. in ECCO-TCP



#### what's "normal"? ####



Make my own guesses as to what the print landscape was like, and what this means (close-read something interesting that emerges, perhaps works that misrepresent their contents)



#### close read: ? ####



### conclusions ###



#### compare archives ####



 Which of these archives are the most "reliable", and which the most "distorted"? (obvs interrogate this framework)

	•	What’s in all these, anyway?

	⁃	What does ECCO-TCP leave out compared to ECCO? Compared to ESTC? (Can I come up with adjustment factors?)

	⁃	How do digital vs physical holdings compare?



#### what's "normal"? ####



What is a "normal" footprint in the print culture of this decade? (i.e., what are the boundaries a work has to surpass to be unusually popular or unusually unpopular?)



## ch 3 - archive popularity ##



Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity[ TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2nd or 10th edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.] in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share.[ Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.] After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.

## ch 4 - networks ##



Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work[ TK: Jon Mee, Kevin Gilmartin and Paul Keen are others who would be important here. Plus scholars who focus more on conservatism, perhaps M. O. Grenby for example? Or even much earlier work by Marilyn Butler?] already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses.[^cf3] My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.

## ch 5 - networks popularity ##



Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical — or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream” — printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a taxonomy of concrete and unchanging ideological stances.[ TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.] This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and of authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers[ TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.]. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, and what kind of “alternatives” they offer to the mainstream. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview[ TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.]. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices within the horizon of expectations of the radical circles I (and other scholars) expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.



## coda? - gothic ##



A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.

### ECCO ###



My ECCO metadata presented particular challenges. I had access to MARC records, which stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue. At several points, I read this data with my feeble non-machine eyes in order to guide my data processing. Using MarcEdit, I converted these MARC records to csv files which could, on OpenRefine, be read, manipulated, and merged like my other corpora. Since I was not able to simply convert “all the MARC headings that exist” using MarcEdit, I used all numbers 1 to 999 and [will] delete empty columns.

ECCO encodes much of its data in “unassigned” columns, rather than the standardized LOC categories.

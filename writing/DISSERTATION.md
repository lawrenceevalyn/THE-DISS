Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99



My dissertation seeks to determine, at as minute a level of detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like (in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers), and how this print landscape persists in archives.



## outline ##



My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the existing digital archives of the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade, with some discussion of celebrity as it manifests in print culture. Chapter four turns its attention to the radical press, and the social ties underlying radical writing and publishing. A potential fifth chapter could explore the penetration of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode; I would be interested to see what percentage of works during the decade can be said to contain Gothic materials.



## intro - archive formation ##



My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade.

My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, I will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty.

My subject matter situates me in a densely-discussed intersection of scholarly fields.



The years 1789-99 make an eleven-year “decade” delimited by the major events of the French Revolution, but also home to a crucial literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form. 

18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernacular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. 

The introduction will also address who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period.

(How do I define my geographical area? England, or “Britain”? I could just focus on London; even if I try not to, I suspect actually nearly everything will end up being from London.) 



## ch 1 - digital corpora ##



Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.

 The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to facsimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience flying to California in order to be taught about HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible.

Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.

Current materials acquired include:

* 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue

*42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online

* 10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online

* 4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library

* 466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership

Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).

The second chapter thus establishes the corpora with which I will answer my subsequent questions.



## ch 2 - mainstream press ##



Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to present a study of mainstream print production during the decade.

One thread of inquiry is simply to recover contemporary printing practices: who was printing what, and when? What role do chapbooks and religious tracts play? Do our archives simply replicate the output of the major publishing houses?

 Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? If possible, I would also like to examine theatrical production through this framework. Given the heightened ephemerality of theatre, it seems likely that the re-staging of an older play will be even more interestingly shaped by its potential to provide a timely response to the context in which it is re-staged.

A second thread of inquiry shaped by this attention to mainstream print production is to examine celebrity via print culture. Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather that nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare how famous various literary celebrities were over the course of the decade. The technical challenge for this part of the project is to define a feasible and fruitful metric of celebrity. In addition to looking at various raw publication counts, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. I will also discuss popularity more generally: after developing a few different metrics for popularity, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? Why does one corpus show one popular thing, and another show another?



## ch 3 - radical press ##



My fourth chapter turns its attention to the radical press. It will use social network graphs of writers and printers to study the personal connections making up this underground print culture. (Look for political clusters in graphs, and printing circles / overlapping circles)

Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these texts? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Authors choosing publishers strategically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?

(There must be something about competing definitions of “popular,” i.e., pop culture vs populism)



## ch 5 - gothic? ##



A potential fifth chapter could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production. (Assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) My previous work suggests that the Gothic, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. This chapter use a stylometric approach to computationally identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? (I expect it to be a lot.) What kinds of literary productions are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses?

# Guiding Principles #



## Reparative Reading ##



"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."

"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



## Information Density ##



I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.



I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.



### Tufte's six principles of design: ###



1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences

2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't do anything with the information without causality)

3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate

4. *completely integrate* words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc. Provide information at exact point of need

5. documentation must thoroughly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales

6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.



keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your content



## Finish The Figures ##



It is disproportionally difficult to revisit a graph that is 80% complete to add the remaining finishing touches; before putting down one phase of a project, take the time to fully finish the figures as beautiful, print-resolution images.



## I'm Not Writing About ##



… reception history outside the 1790s.

Title: DISSERTATION  
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

# ch 1 - intro #



My first chapter sets out the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will discuss, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are seeking to develop less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive[ Is there a better term? (why did TK think I wanted “anti-interpretive”?)] digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this this eleven-year “decade” to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s[ TK: Can you clarify this? Are you talking about the focus of the recent scholarship, or the focus of the writers at the time? As you rightly indicate elsewhere, these two things may not match -- your project might show the preoccupations of modern scholarship to be projections of our own rather than an accurate reflection of what dominated at the time. But “decade-long focus” makes it sound as though you’re talking about the 1790s writers themselves, i.e. accepting that “our” 1790s (dominated by, say, Thelwall and Wollstonecraft) is the same as the “real” one (though that might turn out to have been dominated by, say, Edmund Burke and Hannah More).] will highlight a decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women writers.[ Although all of these elements interest me, and I anticipate that attention to this decade will reveal their prominence, I seek to avoid framing my inquiry explicitly around them and thus begging the question of their importance.] Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history was filtered into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.

### many definitions of DH ###



The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological. [ADD A COUPLE DEFINITIONS OF DH HERE]. These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.” Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life. [ADD SOME DIGITAL CULTURAL STUDIES STYLE DEFINITIONS HERE]. This kind of work is increasingly described as “digital cultural studies.” In positioning this work as a “DH” dissertation, I might at first glance seem to belong squarely within the “computational humanities.” To be sure, much of this work is intended to apply existing computational methodologies to conduct otherwise old-fashioned literary research. Several of my contributions, too, are purely methodological in nature, in the development of new code and new guidelines for computational research using particular digital resources. However, as a fuller discussion of Johanna Drucker’s distinction between “data” and “capta” will elucidate later in this chapter, no computational research exists separately from a specific, local, culturally-defined context. Accordingly, my computational research into eighteenth century literature and my development of new computational methodologies are both inevitably tied to “digital culture.” My results often have more to say about contemporary digital archives, and the history of literary record-keeping, than they do about the eighteenth century itself. I therefore rely on an extensive body of work in cultural digital studies to examine not only the eighteenth century, but eighteenth century studies.



### many histories of DH ###



When telling a history of “DH,” one has many histories to choose from, all freighted with different implications for contemporary practice. [TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF DH]. [FEMINIST HISTORY OF DH.] As these competing historiographies show, [CONCLUSION TO THIS PARAGRAPH.]



### many histories of 1790s ###



So, too, are there many “histories” — or perhaps, narratives — available to describe the 1790s. [FOCUS ON POLITICS]. [FOCUS ON ROMANTICISM]. [FOCUS ON GOTHIC]. Of necessity, each of these histories must exclude something. [WHAT EACH EXCLUDES].



#### rise of the novel ####



### reparative reading ###



It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia. [SUMMARIZE SEDGWICK AND REPARATIVE READING]. Rita Felski, in her recent monograph The Limits of Critique, expands on Sedgwick. [SUMMARIZE FELSKI]. Sedgwick is often critiqued for painting a much clearer picture of the paranoid mode than the reparative mode, leaving it unclear how one is meant to escape paranoia’s double-bind. But this is not to say that the attempt itself is unworthy. [CONCLUSION HERE].



### BLUF ###



These, then, are the three scholarly conversations to which this dissertation contributes: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the theoretical frameworks within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the two experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields.

# THE DISS #



## proposal intro ##



Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99



My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape[ TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise …  ] in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives[ TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters – or can you?]. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices[ TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.]. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.



## ch 2 - archives ##



Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.



### intro ###



#### lit review ####



##### Lesser & Farmer debate #####



Do these citations with some kind of LaTeX to learn that process



A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer & Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.”



Blayney believes that Lesser & Farmer attempt to disprove his “one inescapable fact about printed plays—namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been” (7). But what really matters to him about identifying the “best-selling moneyspinners” of the day is not the ‘moneyspinning’ — the question of whether, when publisher bought a play, he was making a sound financial decision — but about the cultural centrality of ‘bestsellers’. The total market share of religious texts matters, not because it meant that publishers turned their highest profits off of religious texts, but because “[c]ustomers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other ‘literary’ publications,” evidence of “just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers” (7). Lesser and Farmer do not contradict the importance of religious texts to readers. But, in setting out “not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (F&L 213), they make the case that books with low market share, books that are not “best-selling,” could nonetheless be “moneyspinners.” Their rebuttal states that “...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low” (F&L 213), but what they leave somewhat unstated is: “in high demand” with whom?



My own work seeks to examine reprints, but in a more limited fashion than Farmer & Lesser were able to do. Rather than determine the reprint rate of various kinds of fiction, I carry out a Blayney-style examination of pure market share. I seek to identify reprints in order to determine the market share of new versus reprinted material in any given year. 



##### How do people determine popularity? #####



	1.	(Reprinting) Simon Bainbridge: best-selling, most-reprinted, most-adapted

	2.	(Assertion) George Taylor: simply asserts that some things are popular

	3.	(Assertion) Peter Murphy: despite promising that his study “examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history,” Murphy says NOTHING AT ALL about how well, to whom, for how much, etc etc things were sold.

	4.	(Performances) Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, et al.: number of performances per play (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory)

	5.	(Book history) Cronin: mostly asserts that people are “popular” or “celebrated”; with Erasmus Darwin, supports this by saying that the book The Botanic Garden is beautiful & expensive

	6.	(Editions, reprints, market share, profitability) Lesser & Farmer, Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade - “we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

	7.	(Market share) Blayney

	8.	(Title counts) MacLeod on the Minerva press — evaluates most popular authors & subgenres based on the number of “works published” or “titles” (unclear if this includes reprints)





##### popularity is actually impossible #####



It is not, in fact, possible to calculate 



Without [certain kinds of evidence], as F&L note, “we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books… if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists” (F&L 16)

Would need size of print runs and cost to produce, as well as sale price, and quantity sold.

[So it’s a little nonsense when people just say that something is popular]



##### Numbers to compare to #####



Comedies vs tragedies performed: the ratio of comedies to tragedies performed was an astonishing 14 to 1 in Paris (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory by Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, James P. McGregor, and Mark V. Olsen)



#### corpora ####



##### selection criteria #####



The full scope of my project is to grapple with every online database which contains at least 100 texts meeting my criteria: printed, in England, between the years 1789-99. 

I exclude databases of diaries or correspondence, since they are not printed. This has the effect of excluding single-author databases.



###### women's archives ######



I make an exception for archives which specifically seek to address gaps in archival holdings due to systemic bias, that is, three archives focused on women’s writing: Orlando, Chawton, and [I thought there was a third one].

For the most part archives are either comprehensive and have significantly more than 100 texts, or they are single-author / single-researcher focused, and thus have significantly less than 100. These kinds of reparative projects occupy the middle space.



##### these are all databases #####



The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)



What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.

A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.

Another approach is to ignore the categories and use things like topic modelling; relies on a more intimate knowledge of the information being studies (i.e., humanities expertise)



##### so what? #####



These basic factual questions, about what is in the various eighteenth century digital corpora that represent “mass” 18thC holdings for scholars, matter because []. Even though the specific numbers are likely to change as these digital holdings are continuously updated, my investigation of an archive “snapshot” matters because [they show how questions of fact can (and cannot) be answered?]



#### demographics ####



##### titles per year #####



##### men vs women vs unsigned #####



Can I identify male/female ratios?



### reprints ###



#### methods ####



Before I develop custom code, I establish some baselines by taking a random sample of 100 titles from each of my key corpora. I manually identify the original publication date of each title, and whether that title appears reprinted elsewhere in the corpus.



As I expand to algorithmically examine the full corpora, I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words “Xth edition.”

If this method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ (as determined by comparison to my random sample) I won’t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles?

Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching… unless it’s small enough for me to do manually (unlikely)



##### taking samples #####



First, I make sure the data is “clean” and comparable to all the others:

- Jan 1 1789 to Dec 31 1799

- ENGLAND ONLY, no Ireland or Scotland

- With ECCO, make sure I don’t have duplicate entries



I get a count of how many titles are in the corpus.



I use random.org to get 100 randomly-generated numbers. I use the “sequence” generator, not the “integer” generator.



#### sample: reprints ####



Compare most-reprinted texts overall to inclusions in smaller archives



ESTC

ECCO

ECCO-TCP



HathiTrust

ProQuest

BL 19thC



END?

WWO+Chawton combo?



Gutenberg

Book Tracker



Google Books??

Internet Archive?



#### sample: print runs ####



Take a random sample for which I attempt to locate size of print run



Radcliffe doesn’t need many editions because her print runs started out large — take a random sample and see if I can find print runs for the works

Compare the popularity order produced by raw edition count to the one normalized by print run — what’s the error rate?



Ask Tom how to find these numbers (it’s not in databases, but I can read a paper book! — This is one of the things that makes my methodology not 100% DH)



#### what's "normal"? ####



Computationally identify reprints in ECCO

Come up with a number that would be a "lot" of reprints vs "not a lot" (to gauge popularity generally)

How old were books, usually? (i.e., how long ago was their first edition)



#### close read: Paine vs WW vs Blake ? ####



Paine vs Wordsworth vs Blake? (Vs CSmith and Radcliffe?) How to accord importance to these writers is at the heart of much of this project.



#### close read: something old? ####



Any cool “1790s lit” not written in the 1790s? Shakespeare? Goldsmith?



### topics ###



#### methods ####



Develop some kind of ontology of topic that encompasses "everything" (sticking to 18thC frameworks of, e.g., history vs romance)



##### topic modelling #####



I turn to topic modelling as a way to move “laterally”: if I can only query attributes which every archive records, I can’t query anything at all.



#### sample: truthful titles ####



Take a random sample to see how accurate titles are to contents overall



#### compare archives ####



Count how many works of each topic appear in each archive -- what kinds of content has been excluded in each, esp. in ECCO-TCP



#### what's "normal"? ####



Make my own guesses as to what the print landscape was like, and what this means (close-read something interesting that emerges, perhaps works that misrepresent their contents)



#### close read: ? ####



### conclusions ###



#### compare archives ####



 Which of these archives are the most "reliable", and which the most "distorted"? (obvs interrogate this framework)

	•	What’s in all these, anyway?

	⁃	What does ECCO-TCP leave out compared to ECCO? Compared to ESTC? (Can I come up with adjustment factors?)

	⁃	How do digital vs physical holdings compare?



#### what's "normal"? ####



What is a "normal" footprint in the print culture of this decade? (i.e., what are the boundaries a work has to surpass to be unusually popular or unusually unpopular?)



## ch 3 - archive popularity ##



Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity[ TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2nd or 10th edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.] in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share.[ Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.] After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.

## ch 4 - networks ##



Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work[ TK: Jon Mee, Kevin Gilmartin and Paul Keen are others who would be important here. Plus scholars who focus more on conservatism, perhaps M. O. Grenby for example? Or even much earlier work by Marilyn Butler?] already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses.[^cf2] My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.



### British Book Trade Index ###



OBVIOUSLY this work should be built on the back of the British Book Trade Index, I can’t BELIEVE nobody told me about it!!

https://www.nls.uk/catalogues/scottish-book-trade-index



## ch 5 - networks popularity ##



Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical — or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream” — printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a taxonomy of concrete and unchanging ideological stances.[ TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.] This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and of authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers[ TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.]. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, and what kind of “alternatives” they offer to the mainstream. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview[ TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.]. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices within the horizon of expectations of the radical circles I (and other scholars) expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.



## coda? - gothic ##



A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.

### ECCO ###



My ECCO metadata presented particular challenges. I had access to MARC records, which stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue. At several points, I read this data with my feeble non-machine eyes in order to guide my data processing. Using MarcEdit, I converted these MARC records to csv files which could, on OpenRefine, be read, manipulated, and merged like my other corpora. Since I was not able to simply convert “all the MARC headings that exist” using MarcEdit, I used all numbers 1 to 999 and [will] delete empty columns.

ECCO encodes much of its data in “unassigned” columns, rather than the standardized LOC categories.

[^cf1]: Although all of these elements interest me, and I anticipate that attention to this decade will reveal their prominence, I seek to avoid framing my inquiry explicitly around them and thus begging the question of their importance.

[^cf2]: Per Terry’s suggestions, I would likely begin here with Jon Klancher, The Making of English Reading Audiences, 1790-1832; Marcus Wood, Radical Satire and Print Culture, 1790-1822; and David Worrall, Radical Culture: Discourse, Resistance, and Surveillance, 1790-1820. Other promising titles include Social networks in the long eighteenth century : clubs, literary salons, textual coteries, ed. Ileana Baird; and The enlightenment & the book : Scottish authors & their publishers in eighteenth-century Britain, Ireland & America, by Richard B. Sher, to capture different parts of the publishing landscape.

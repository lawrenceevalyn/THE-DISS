**Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789--99**



My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape[ TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise ...  ] in England 1789-99 was actually like  --- in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers --- and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives[ TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters -- or can you?]. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices[ TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.]. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.

### 1.1.1.  intro ###  

This dissertation in concerned with the process by which texts do or don’t ‘enter’ into ‘canons’ of writings, particularly in the heightened political environment of England[ meaning?] in the 1790s. In service of this goal, this dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like. It also seeks to explain, in equally minute detail, why this task of ‘objective’ historical recovery is[ okay we'll need to theorize this but basically I like it], in fact, impossible[ I would perhaps instead say something like - the challenges inherent, and prob insurmountable, in the task of 'objective historical recovery']. In the process, I show how our persistently perplexing questions about canons can be asked, and answered, in new ways with digital tools. Computational methods, in their close association with ‘big data’, are often advertised as the solution to the problems of scale which are presumed to motivate the formation of selective canons[ needs clarification]. As my own computational experimentation will reveal, however, computational study more commonly undertakes the same judgment and valuation of texts that characterizes ‘canon formation,’ and displaces this process onto ‘corpus building.’ It is difficult, when faced with flawed and complex competing narratives, to resist the impulse to simply critique and reject all options. If we may learn any lessons from the 1790s, however, surely one must be the danger of universal paranoia.[ I do not know what you mean here so flesh out a bit or drop it] Accordingly, this dissertation takes place within three scholarly conversations: the digital humanities, as an increasingly self-reflective set of practices; eighteenth century studies, and the challenges presented by the 1790s; and the frameworks of reparative reading within queer theory which seem to offer valuable resources for both. The remainder of this chapter will describe in more detail the relevant scholarship in all three fields, then discuss the overlaps between them which enable my work. Finally, this chapter will conclude with a description of the two computational experiments which drive the dissertation as a whole, situating them within the three fields, and providing a sketch of their development across the dissertation.  

According to the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), the most popular English authors of the 1790s were Thomas Paine, Hannah More, John Wesley, and William Shakespeare. Of course this inflammatory claim immediately falls apart on further scrutiny. In fact, by the metric of ‘unique entries in the ESTC database,’ the most popular author of the decade is by far Great Britain, followed by Great Britain, Great Britain, Great Britain, and King George III.[^cf1] Paine, More, Wesley and Shakespeare are only able to rise to our notice if we filter out all authors whose names contain the phrase “Great Britain”; otherwise, Shakespeare is outnumbered by the House of Lords and by the Church of England. That is to say, if we equate popularity and importance with quantity of unique publications, we \[end up with garbage.\]



\[And yet, Paine IS regarded as important --- not to mention Shakespeare. So why not More or Wesley?\]  

The core object of study in this dissertation is the writing published in England between 1789 and 1799. I say “writing” and not “literature,” despite the fact that my central interest *is* literature, because I address works whose status as “literary” is contested. I also say “published” rather than “written,” because I address the “1790s-ness” of works written well before this decade, but which took on new and timely meanings when reprinted.

\[I am interested in the canon that includes x and y,. and the contexts of x and y, and the work of x and y'\]  

Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to *do* with texts.



#### 1.1.1.1.  DH ####  

The field of “digital humanities,” now several scholarly generations into its development, has entered the phase in which so many scholars are carrying out “DH” research that no universally-acceptable definition of “DH” can exist[ rephrase]. Many definitions are fundamentally methodological.[^cf2] These definitions describe what might be called a “computational humanities.”[ you need to say more about what this is - one more sentence] Other definitions take up the new importance of digitality in daily life.[^cf3] This kind of work is increasingly described as “digital cultural studies.” In positioning this work as a “DH” dissertation, I might at first glance seem to belong squarely within the first framework, that of the “computational humanities.” To be sure, much of this work is intended to apply existing computational methodologies to conduct otherwise old-fashioned literary research[ what does old-fashioned mean here]. My objects of study are by no means contemporary. Several of my contributions, too, are purely methodological in nature[ not sure about 'purely methodological' here -what do you mean by it?], in the development of new code and new guidelines for computational research using particular digital resources. However, as a fuller discussion of Johanna Drucker’s distinction between “data” and “capta” will elucidate later in this chapter, no computational research exists separately from a specific, local, culturally-defined context. Accordingly, my computational research into eighteenth-century literature and my development of new computational methodologies are both inevitably tied to “digital culture.” My results often have more to say about contemporary digital archives, and the history of literary record-keeping, than they do about the eighteenth century itself. I therefore rely on an extensive body of work in cultural digital studies to examine not only the eighteenth century, but eighteenth century studies.  

[I think it's not reordering but more signposting that you need - so just: Moretti actually says this. My dissertation is post-Moretti - what is that? Well there's underwood, and from him it is useful to keep the connection to non computational techniques - that distant reading is not divorced from other complex histories of lit crit/lit histiory. Of these, the most important to me....]Often discussed as synonymous with “DH” is a set of practices described as “distant reading.” Distant reading is undergoing a shift away from its figurehead in Franco Moretti, who famously coined the original term \\cite\{Moretti:2000ul\}. If we wish to think about distant reading without Moretti, Ted Underwood and Rachel Buurma both provide valuable histories. Ted Underwood’s “Genealogy of Distant Reading” presents a history of distant reading which is not for the most part centrally concerned with computers, and is therefore fundamentally distinct from concepts of “digital humanities” \\cite\{Underwood:2017uc\}. In Underwood’s history, distant reading is “a tradition continuous with earlier forms of macroscopic literary history, distinguished only by an increasingly experimental method, organized by samples and hypotheses that get defined before conclusions are drawn” \\cite\{Underwood:2017uca p.29\}. Underwood “tease\[s\] out the elided social-scientific genealogy behind distant reading” \\cite\{Underwood:2017uca p.39\} to argue that the term “\[d\]istant reading was not coined to describe a radically new method. The first occurrence of the phrase, in \[Franco Moretti’s\] ’Conjectures on World Literature,’ seems in fact to describe the familiar scholarly activity of aggregating and summarizing previous research” \\cite\{Underwood:2017uca p.9\}[ what is your position on this? You go on to Buurma who does connect distant reading to computation - and you suggest how you will draw on similar ideas about collaboeation etc - but this underwood bit dangles].

Rachel Buurma’s history of Josephine Miles adds a specifically computational alternate geneaology for distant reading \\cite\{Buurma:2018wt\}. Miles is proposed as an alternative not to Moretti, but to Roberto Busa, who is often credited with the first large-scale computational literary study. Miles’ history, briefly, is as follows:

In the 1930s, as a graduate student at Berkeley, she completed her first distant reading project: an analysis of the adjectives favored by Romantic poets. In the 1940s, with the aid of a Guggenheim, she expanded this work into a large-scale study of the phrasal forms of the poetry of the 1640s, 1740s, and 1840s. In all of this distant reading work, Miles created her tabulations by hand, with pen and graph paper. She also directed possibly the first literary concordance to use machine methods. In the early 1950s, Miles became project director of an abandoned index-card-based Concordance to the Poetical Works of John Dryden. Partnering with the Electrical Engineering department at Berkeley, and contracting with their computer lab and its IBM tabulation machine, Miles used machine methods to complete the concordance. It was published in 1957, six years after she and several woman graduate students and woman punch-card operators began the work. It was thus begun around the time that Busa circulated early proof-of-concept drafts of his concordance to the complete works of St. Thomas Aquinas, and published 17 years before the first volumes of the 56-volume Index Thomasticus began to appear. \\cite\{Buurma:2018wt\}

Buurma brings Miles’ history to our attention not simply because Miles predates Busa, as a correction of a minor matter of fact.[^cf4] Rather, Buurma emphasizes, Miles’ origin story for computational literary study “can stand as an example of how we might write a history of literary scholarship that does not center originality and individual accomplishment” \\cite\{Buurma:2018wt\}. Unlike Busa, Miles not only gave authorship to the (female) graduate students who carried out much of the labour of creating the concordances, she also thanked and credited the (female) punch card operators who encoded the resulting data.[^cf5] Moreover, when talking of Penny Gee, one of the female staff members of the computer lab, Miles praises her as “‘very smart and good’ and---most importantly---a true collaborator, as opposed to those ‘IBM people from San Jose’ ... ‘I’ve never been able to connect with them,’ Miles explains, ‘though I did with Penny Gee. She really taught me’” \\cite\{Buurma:2018wt\}. Of the positive qualities highlighted here, only one, “smart,” is traditionally valorized among literary critics: to be “good,” a “collaborator,” who can “connect” and “teach” --- as I will discuss more fully in section 1.3 when I turn to Eve Sedgwick’s critique of paranoid reading, these qualities are often seen as incompatible with the singular authority of the figure of ‘the critic.’ Miles’ work, too, struggled to find appreciation “among literary critics who viewed her datasets as merely preparatory to the true work of evaluation” \\cite\{Buurma:2018wt[ Moretti’s mode of distant reading, Klein argues, pursues both the \[SOMETHING\] of the critic and the \[SOMETHING\] of critique, but, as Miles and many scholars like her have demonstrated, these are not inherent to distant reading.]\}.  

Lauren Klein’s paper at MLA 2018, “Distant Reading after Moretti,” in fact poses the turn away from Moretti as an urgent imperative: “what do we do about distant reading, now that we know that Franco Moretti, the man who coined the phrase ‘distant reading,’ and who remains its most famous exemplar, is among the men named as a result of the #MeToo movement” \\cite\{Klein:2018to\}? Klein, drawing on Sara Ahmed’s observation that “sexual harassment is a structural, as well as personal problem,” draws together critiques of distant reading’s exclusion of women in terms of its “issues of *representation* in the field,” its “unduly masculinized *rhetorical* positioning,” its “failure to engage with the *conceptual* issues that relate to women,” and the “actual computational *models* of gender that are often deployed” \\cite\{Klein:2018to\}. All of these critiques of distant reading, Klein argues, show that “it’s not a *coincidence* that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or with race,” but also that these failings are not inevitable: “it’s not that distant reading *can’t* do this work,” she insists, “it’s that it’s yet to sufficiently do so” \\cite\{Klein:2018to\}[ there are a lot of italics here... I think I also think that you may eventually want to rearrange this moretti-underwood-buurma-klein order according to your own position about which of these positions is most useful to you - or just signpost that more. but it's still all very good and useful.].  

Klein’s prescription for change is not dissimilar to Katherine Bode’s somewhat earlier call for “a new object for data-rich literary history” \\cite\{Bode:2017gb\}. Klein calls for “more corpora---more accessible corpora---that perform the work of recovery or resistance” to allow research “beyond quote ‘representative’ samples, which tend to reproduce the same inequities of representation that affect our cultural record as a whole” \\cite\{Klein:2018to\}. Klein also suggests a change in how models are formed: “Instead of first asking what *can* be modeled---what phenomena we can track at scale---we might instead ask: what might be *hidden* in this corpus? And are there methods we might use to bring out significant texts, or clusters of words, that the eye cannot see?” \\cite\{Klein:2018to\}. Bode, too, despite her strong critique of distant reading as it has been practiced by Moretti and Matthew Jockers[^cf6], does not blame distant reading itself. Moretti and Jockers, she argues, “while claiming direct and objective access to ‘everything,’ ... represent and explore only a very limited proportion of the literary system, and do so in an abstract and ahistorical way” \\cite\{Bode:2017gb\}. The many criticisms which Klein compiles, Bode argues, “describe the symptoms -- not the essence -- of a problem, which in fact inheres in Moretti’s and Jockers’s common neglect of \[...\] the bibliographical and editorial approaches that explore and explicate the literary-historical record,” a neglect which is itself “not an effect of importing data into literary history but is inherited from the New Criticism” \\cite\{Bode:2017gb\}. Bode proposes, as an alternative, the creation of scholarly editions of literary systems, which would not only create new, nuanced corpora and models, but would transparently explain those corpora and models as intentionally-crafted expressions of the particular literary system they are being used to explore.  

My own attention to the *sources* of digital knowledge creation comes also from Johanna Drucker, and her distinction between “data” and “capta.” Drucker, in “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,” specifically addresses the digital humanities practice of creating, and then close-reading, data visualizations. She argues that the tools for visual representation which may be effective in the sciences cannot be simply and uncritically transposed to humanistic subject matter. When an experiment is presented as a ‘data visualization,’ she says, “the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework” \\cite\{Drucker:2011uo p.8\}. In fields where the readers of such charts are also frequent creators of charts, and where norms exist to explicitly describe one’s interpretive frameworks in a methodology section, the simplicity and legibility of an individual chart may be a benefit which does not impede complex scrutiny of the information it presents.[^cf7] In a field like literature, however, the “graphical force” of something like a network graph or even a simple pie chart “conceals what the statistician knows very well --- that no ‘data’ preexist their parameterization” \\cite\{Drucker:2011uo p.8\}. Drucker problematizes the term “data,” the etymology of which presents it as a “given” which is stable and independent of observation. She proposes that humanities visualizations embrace, instead, the framework of “capta,” that which is “‘taken’ actively” \\cite\{Drucker:2011uo p.3\}, “fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena” \\cite\{Drucker:2011uo p.50\}. Drucker’s assessment shapes my own prioritization of qualitative and reflective computational research. The term “capta” itself has not seen uptake in subsequent digital humanities scholarship, even in cases where scholars explicitly take Drucker’s warnings to heart. Accordingly, for clarity, this dissertation will continue to use the more usual term “data” to refer to the information gathered for analysis here. However, as I integrate and compare a wide variety of data from many disparate sources, a preliminary task of my analysis is always to determine, as precisely as possible, how the information was captured and quantified.   

This dissertation undertakes computational distant reading. My questions are macroanalytical, and my research proceeds from hypothesis through experiment and results. At every possible point, however, the underlying methodology will be made visible, and its assumptions scrutinized. The bibliographic histories of my multiple corpora are explicit objects of inquiry. Much of the code underlying this project I have written myself. Some has been written at my request. In every case where the code is available to me, the program itself appears in Appendix A (“Codebase”), accompanied by a plain-language explanation of how it operates. Where I have used closed-source software, Appendix A contains an explanation of my best guess at its underlying process. My exact use of these tools --- sufficient for another to replicate my work --- is provided in Appendix B (“Methodology”). These details are explicated in full in the appendices in order not to over-burden the body of the dissertation, but they are by no means *confined* to the appendices. Computation is not a “black box” to be consulted for simple answers, but is inextricable from my reasoning and argument.  

Additionally, all of the figures presented in this dissertation are of my own design. My design praxis is informed by the work of Edward Tufte and Alberto Cairo, both of whom provide practical design advice in service of demystifying the visual rhetoric by which graphs present their arguments.[^cf8] Neither Tufte nor Cairo is a scholar of media studies; rather, they are professional practitioners of ‘data visualization’ who reflect critically on the assumptions of their work. Tufte’s work primarily strives to correct badly-designed data visualizations, and the dangerous decisions that bad design can lead people to. His most famous example is an analysis of the engineers’ report at NASA which led to the ill-fated launch of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986: as his extensive visual analysis argues, the engineers (untrained in graphic design) unintentionally obfuscated crucial information about the day’s launch conditions. The poorly-designed graphics these engineers produced made the launch appear low risk to their superiors; despite the engineers’ strong warnings, their verbal argument was disregarded in favor of their accidental graphical argument. As Tufte demonstrates, a few simple alterations of their graphic design would have made it obvious that the day’s unprecedentedly low weather was extremely dangerous, and potentially averted disaster \\cite\{Tufte:2001vw\}.[^cf9] Tufte’s six principles of design[^cf10] primarily seek to guide undertrained designers away from misleading themselves. Cairo, following on Tufte’s work from the perspective of an active journalist, more often turns his attention to successful designs which mislead their audiences intentionally. His forthcoming book, *How Charts Lie*, addresses the readers of infographics with insights into visual literacy \\cite\{Cairo:ikIksuMr\}. His preceding book, *The Truthful Art*, addresses the creators of good-faith infographics with insights into visual manipulation \\cite\{Cairo:2016uv\}. Cairo draws a distinction between “data visualization” and “infographics”: “an infographic tells the stories that its designer wants to explain, but a data visualization lets people build their own insights based on the evidence provided,” summarized more succinctly as “infographics to explain, data visualizations to explore” \\cite\{Cairo:2014tl\}. Using this terminology, my argument will proceed with infographics in the body of the dissertation as curated figures to support my argument, with fuller data visualizations available in Appendix C (“Data”) to allow further exploration. Following in both Tufte and Cairo’s footsteps, I conceive of the figures throughout this dissertation as rhetorical devices. In service of arguing honestly, therefore, my designs --- in the body of the dissertation and in Appendix C --- are accompanied by footnoted explanations of my design rationale.   

My goal in this dissertation is to produce a series of *fruitful models*. \[Willard McCarty’s descriptive work on the concept of modelling VERBS modelling’s processes of abstraction.\]\[QUOTES FROM McCARTY\] Another way of expressing this might be to borrow from the vocabulary of social science research: I would like to make discoveries about a “population” which is inaccessible to me, namely, “everything printed in England 1789-99.” Since I cannot access this population in full, I have taken a series of “samples,” which I hope to be representative; each sample can be examined as evidence of the makeup of the source population, but must also be examined in and of itself *as* a sample. \[therefore, not attempting ‘accuracy’\] \[Rather than making claims about the 1790s each claim is filtered through / constrained by the specific model of the 1790s used to make it\] Rather than producing a clear and pristine truth, my models are, in fact, quite likely to contradict each other. In these moments of contradiction, \[we have the best opportunity to learn, because we can see why they contradict, and therefore why something may or may not be true.\] \[These opportunity are “fruitful”\] \[Expand on “fruitfulness”\]



#### 1.1.1.2.  1790s ####  

All of the computational work in this dissertation does have an aim beyond itself: to recapture, in as minute detail as possible, the print landscape[ why landscape metaphor - what other ones: can you be plainer or more conscious about choice of metaphor?] in England between January 1 1789 and December 31 1799. This eleven-year “decade” was a turbulent one across the Channel, encompassing the whole of the French Revolution, from the Estates General in 1789 to Napoleon’s coup in 1799.[^cf11] In England, these events caused strong and variously nationalist reactions in a country which had so recently lost its colonies in America and feared that a French invasion could come at any moment. This is the decade of *Common Sense*, it is the decade of *Lyrical Ballads*; it is the decade of Hannah More, it is the decade of Ann Radcliffe; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. Charles Dickens’ now-famous superlative degree of comparison captures the tension between Enlightenment or otherwise political thinkers and Romantic or Gothic artists as contemporary literary scholars grapple with these modes[ so I know extremely little about any of this but I do know you can't use empiricist in this way - which makes me think maybe you need to rework with that new structure above in mind - and keep it more to facts - here is how the literature of this period is characterized normally. Quote some other scholars etc.]. Each literary ‘mode’ was imbued with the potential for national importance.  

To navigate the 1790s, I return to four ‘key’ authors whose careers and works usefully focalize my core questions of genre, publics, and the status of literature and writers. These authors are Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Ann Radcliffe. All four authors were highly productive in the 1790s, and all four had complex and contested literary legacies after the 1790s. In the following chapters of this dissertation, I will ask whether and how contemporary digital archives make these authors visible. First, however, I will provide a brief overview of each author’s major works, general biography, and critical reception.  

Hannah More’s first book published was the pastoral drama *A Search after Happiness*, published in 1773. In 1774 she publishes her play *The Inflexible Captive,* which is produced in 1775 at the Theatre Royal in Bath. In 1776, she publishes *Sir Eldred of the Bower and the Bleeding Rock*. In 1777, she publishes her first conduct-book, *Essays on Various Subjects*, dedicated to the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu. Her play *Percy, A Tragedy* is also produced at Covent Garden in 1777, running through 1778. In 1779, her third play, *The Fatal Falsehood*, is performed but is considered a failure, after which More stops writing for the stage. In 1782, she publishes *Sacred Dramas* and *Sensibility: A Poem*. In 1783, she writes *The Bas Bleu: or, Conversation*, a celebration of bluestocking culture, which circulates in manuscript but does not see print until 1786. In 1784 she was made a member of the Rouen Academy of Arts, Sciences, and Letters. In 1786 she publishes *Florio*, a poem in praise or rural life, and *The Bas Bleu*. In 1788 she published, anonymously, *Thoughts on the Importance of the Manners of the Great to General Society*, as well as *Slavery: A Poem*.

More’s first publication in this dissertation’s decade of interest is her 1789 poem, *Bishop Bonner’s Ghost*, published as a broadsheet by Horace Walpole’s Strawberry Hill Press. In 1790, she published, anonymously, *An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable Works*. In 1793, she published, anonymously, “Village Politics,” one of many responses to Thomas Paine’s *Rights of Man*, a counter-revolutionary tract for the poor. In 1793, published *Remarks on the Speech of M. Dupont* in aid of French emigrant clergy. In 1795 she began the massive undertaking of editing, and largely writing, *The Cheap Repository Tracts*. These tracts were distributed as inexpensive chapbooks from 1795 to 1797. In 1798, she reprinted many of these tracts in volume form. In 1799 she published, under her own name, *Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education*.

Unlike Charlotte Smith and Mary Robinson, More had a long career after this dissertation’s decade of interest. In 1803, she “publishes patriotic ballads to stiffen the national sinews during fears of a French invasion” (Stott). 1804 sees “‘The White Slave Trade’, an attack on the frivolity of the fashionable world, published anonymously in the Evangelical journal, the *Christian Observer*” (Stott). In 1805, she published, anonymously, *Hints toward forming the Character of a Young Princess*. In 1808 she publishes, anonymously, her only novel, *Coelebs in Search of a Wife*. In 1811 she publishes *Practical Piety*. In 1812 she publishes *Christian Morals*. In 1815 she published *Essay on the Character and Writings of St. Paul*. In 1817, in response to civil unrest, she began republishing the *Cheap Repository Tracts* as *Cheap Repository Tracts Suited to the Present Times*. She reprinted and distributed these from 1817 to 1819, and wrote some new ones. In 1819, she published *Moral Sketches* and an abolitionist poem, *The Twelfth of August, or The Feast of Freedom*. In 1821, she publishes *Bible Rhymes*. In 1825, she publishes *The Spirit of Prayer*, her last publication, written at age 80 after more than 50 years of writing.  

Much of More’s personal life centred around educational ventures. In 1758, when More was thirteen, her eldest sister Mary More opened a girls’ boarding school, which Hannah More would soon assist in running. In 1762, this school moved to larger premises. In 1767, More accepted a proposal of marriage from William Turner, though this did not end in marriage: “After a rather humiliating six-year courtship (during which the pending marriage was postponed three times by the gentleman), a settlement was reached on behalf of More by her family, resulting in an annuity that granted her enough financial independence to embark on a literary career” (Prior). When the engagement was finally broken in 1773, More made her first visit to London, and her life’s focus shifted from education to literature. She moved in literary circles, joined the Bluestockings, and particularly befriended the famous actor David Garrick. More was the “permanent house guest” (Stott) of David and Eva Garrick from 1776 until David Garrick’s death in 1779, after which she remained in the household as Eva Garrick’s companion.

However, after Garrick’s death (and the failure of her third play, also in 1779), More’s focus shifts again, from London literary life to religious life. Her interest in the growing movement of Evangelicals ultimately brought her to the Clapham Sect, whose foremost cause was the abolition of the slave trade (Prior). She returned to Somerset, buying her own house, Cowslip Green, in 1785, and in religion brought her back to education. She and her sister Patty More founded the first of the Mendip Schools at Cheddar, Somerset in 1789; other schools follow at Shipham, Rowberrow, Nailsea, Blagdon, Wedmore, and elsewhere (Stott). “With the encouragement and support of the Clapham Evangelicals ... More undertook opening and operating Sunday Schools ... in order to teach the children of the laboring classes to read and write, to learn the catechism, and to lead moral lives informed by Christian teaching. Though the effort was clouded by political and theological controversy from various sides, More eventually opened sixteen schools that taught hundreds of students.” (Prior). In 1790, the More sisters hand over the Park Street school to Selina Mills. In 1792, she founds women’s benefit clubs at Cheddar and Shipham. 1799 marks the beginning of the “Blagdon controversy”: “one of More's teachers is accused of Methodism; the accusation widens into a series of attacks on More for alleged religious and political subversion; as a result she suffers depression and nervous collapse and for a while is unable to write,” until 1802 (Stott).

In 1801, More retired--- somewhat. She moved to a new home, Barley Wood, outside the village of Wrington, but “\[t\]hough her years of publishing had come to an end, her pen was not stilled as she responded to the volumes of letters she received,” and she continued to receive and advise many visitors (Prior). In 1813 she founded an auxiliary Bible Society at Wrington. “She continued to support generously efforts at poverty-relief until her death. More died September 7, 1833, having survived all of her sisters and most of the members of her London circle of friends” (Prior).  

“With a lifetime that spanned the Augustan age to the Victorian age, and a writing career nearly as long, Hannah More can be considered at once both the intellectual child of the Age of Johnson and, in spirit if not quite in chronology, the ‘first Victorian’.” (Prior)



“To some recent critics, More is a reactionary, patriarchal foil to her radical feminist counterpart, Mary Wollstonecraft, an advocate for a conservative, counter-revolutionary sort of progress for women. Other critics, in recognition of her call for reform across all social strata, place More somewhere in between these extreme views. This variety of critical views points to the complexity of both More and the age of paradigmatic change in which More occupied an unusual position” (Prior)



“More’s writing now \[i.e., in the 1790s\] aimed more directly at a conservative agenda of reform that excluded no social class. While all of these works are conservative in assuming the preservation of class boundaries, they are progressive in their belief that individual reform is possible within one’s class, whether high, middle, or low. Such a position is now variously interpreted along a spectrum of critical views. Some critics accuse More’s efforts of serving merely to reinforce class boundaries by alleviating the worst distresses of poverty without eradicating it; others see her attempts as ultimately more effective because modest reform rather than radical revolution was more widely acceptable and achievable.” (Prior)  

Charlotte Smith’s literary career began with the publication of her volume of poetry *Elegiac Sonnets*, in 1784. Six sonnets by Smith had appeared in periodicals in 1782 and 1784 prior to the publication of *Elegiac Sonnets* \\cite\{Roberts:2019ur\}. The first edition (1784) contains sixteen sonnets: ten original sonnets, then “other essays” in the middle of the volume (a translated “Song. From the French of Cardinal Bernis” and a poem in couplets, “The Origin of Flattery”), and six more sonnets, three of which are translations “from Petrarch”, and three which are “Supposed to be written by Werter.” A second edition of *Elegiac Sonnets* rapidly followed the first in the same year, with only slight amendments. In the next year, 1785: “Translation of Prévost’s Manon Lescaut withdrawn from publication by Smith after criticism of the work’s morality. Book sold by publisher without author’s name.” \\cite\{Fry:1996tb p.xi\}.  In 1785, Smith legally separated from her husband, “an unusual step for a woman of her time” \\cite\{Fry:1996tb p.7\}. The 3rd & 4th eds of *Elegiac Sonnets* (1786) introduce 20 new sonnets, and the non-sonnet poems are removed. A new preface is added, now dated from Woolbeding, a small West Sussex village where Smith moved in 1785. In the 1st ed., 12 take the Shakespearean form, and the remaining 4 vary in their irregularity. As she expands the volume, Smith’s use of the sonnet becomes increasingly experimental \\cite\{Roberts:2019ur\}; as she writes in the preface to the 3rd ed., despite attempting the Italian model, “I am persuaded that, to the generality of readers, those which are less regular will be more pleasing.” 1786 also saw the publication of Smith’s *The Romance of Real Life*, a translation of *Les Causes Célèbres*. In 1788 she publishes her first original novel, *Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle*.

1789 begins this dissertation’s decade of interest, a period of intense productivity for Smith: she has at least one new publication almost every year from 1789-1799. In 1789, she publishes her second original novel, *Ethelinde, or the Recluse of the Lake*, and a fifth edition of *Elegiac Sonnets* is issued. “The fifth edition of 1789 perhaps marks the high point of Smith’s sonnet success. The edition was published by Thomas Cadell by subscription, with list of the names of over 800 ‘noble, literary, and respectable names \[...\] a brilliant assemblage’, as Smith describes them in the new preface. The edition also includes five illustrations, engraved by the eminent Thomas Stothard among others. As well as twelve new sonnets, the non-sonnet poems were now re-inserted (due to popular demand), together with an elegy and ode” \\cite\{Roberts:2019ur\}. 1790 has no publications. In 1791 she publishes *Celestina*; in 1792, *Desmond*[ add info about the “phases” of her novelistic career], and a sixth edition of *Elegiac Sonnets*.  The sixth edition was published in 1792, with eleven new sonnets and four non-sonnet poems, which completed the first volume, together with the new preface bemoaning Smith’s personal circumstances. Most of the new poems added were from the novel *Celestina*. Although it continued to be reprinted, reaching its tenth edition in 1812, after this edition no further poems were added. In 1793 she publishes *The Emigrants*, a poem in two volumes, as well as *The Old Manor House*, a novel. In 1794, *The Wanderings of Warwick* and *The Banished Man*. In 1795 she publishes her sixth novel, *Montalbert*, and begins writing in a new genre with *Rural Walks: in dialogues intended for the use of young persons*. 1796 sees its sequel in *Rambles Farther*, as well as the novel *Marchmont*, and *A Narrative of the loss of the Catherine, Venus, and Piedmont Transports and the Thomas, Golden Grove, and Aeolus Merchant ships near Weymouth*. 1797 has no publications. 1798 sees the novel *The Young Philosopher*, and more natural history for children in *Minor Morals*. In 1799, Smith tries her hand at theatre with *What Is She?*, a comedy, and publishes the first two volumes of *Letters of a Solitary Wanderer*.

After this dissertation’s decade of interest, Smith continues to write at a slightly less frenetic pace. In 1800 she publishes three additional volumes of *Letters of a Solitary Wanderer.* In 1804, she publishes *Conversations, Introducing Poetry: chiefly on subjects of natural history for the use of children and young persons*. In 1806, Smith publishes *History of England, from the earliest records, to the peace of Amiens, in a series of letters to a young lady at schools*, and Smith herself dies, age 55. The next year sees the posthumous publication of *Beachy Head* and *The Natural History of Birds, intended chiefly for young person*s.  

Smith’s personal life sometimes overshadows this career. As her works often make clear to her readers, after a briefly comfortable youth as the daughter of a well-off country gentleman who lived beyond his means, she was married at age sixteen to Benjamin Smith, “son of a prosperous London merchant and owner of Barbados sugar cane plantations. The marriage was contracted hastily to remove her from her paternal home, now dominated by her new wealthy stepmother. Looking back in bitterness nearly forty years later, Charlotte Smith described the event as her father's decision to sell her like a “legal prostitute, in my early youth, or what the law calls infancy” (Smith to Sarah Rose, 15 June 1804).” \\cite\{Roberts:2019ur\}. Benjamin Smith was cruel and violently abusive. He was also so financially irresponsible that his wealthy father wanted to prevent Benjamin from inheriting. “In an attempt to provide for his daughter-in-law, Richard bequeathed the bulk of his property to her children. But he had drawn up his will without professional advice; legal wranglings over the inheritance worth nearly £36,000 soon arose and were not settled until almost forty years later. By 1783 Benjamin had already unlawfully squandered more than a third of this trust and, as a consequence, found himself first in deep debt and then in King's Bench Prison.” \\cite\{Roberts:2019ur\}



“Her husband Benjamin Smith had been arrested for debt and embezzlement in December 1783, and it was from King’s Bench Prison that Smith negotiated the publication of her sonnets, partly to fund her husband’s release and in order to support her family of, at that point, nine children. James Dodsley of Pall Mall, who had initially refused the sonnets, finally accepted and published them after the intervention of the popular poet and near neighbour of Smith, William Hayley, to whom the edition is dedicated.” \\cite\{Roberts:2019ur\}.



1806 her husband dies, his father-in-law’s estate is finally settled, Smith dies  

Smith’s posthumous critical reception has undergone multiple shifts in appreciation and obscurity. Duckling’s study of her presence in anthologies indicates that shortly after her death in 1806, Smith was widely eulogized and anthologized, remembered and emulated as an important British poet. As the nineteenth century went on, poetesses began to be anthologized separately from poets, in collections with ambitions that were commercial rather than intellectual; Smith, too, “lost intellectual ground” even as she continued to be sold (Duckling 2016). By the end of the nineteenth century, even these volumes marginalized Smith’s poetry, with prefatory material which dismissed them as trite and depressing, unenjoyable reading. In the early twentieth century, Smith began to be considered as a novelist, rather than a poet; this new field did not lead at first to a much better reputation for her. Florence Hilbish produced the first extensive study of Smith, considering her as both poet and novelist, in 1941, to unappreciative reviews: Ernest Bernbaum’s faint praise said that “‘much time and care have been devoted to it; whether deservedly, is perhaps questionable,” since “the subtle or intricate is absent from Charlotte Smith's writings” (138). Hilbish presents Smith’s emotional poetry as sincere rather than conventional, and her prose as more motivated by politics than commerce.

Duckling credits the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s with the beginning of Smith’s recovery (217): the renewed interest in women’s writing rediscovered her novels, and especially the radical political content which Hilbish had observed. At the same time, Bishop Hunt published a record of Smith’s influence on Wordsworth, as demonstrated by an almost overwhelming amount of physical evidence: Wordsworth owned copies of her works, which he annotated; he copied out some of her sonnets in his own hand; he paid her a personal visit; he edited some of her poetry for publication; he wrote explicitly of her influence in notes to his works. Hunt calls Smith “an important early influence on Wordsworth which has not been explored in any detail up to now” (85); his abstract somewhat snarkily asserts that “Wordsworth did not suddenly start writing sonnets in 1802 simply because he happened to read Milton’s.” However, Hunt has little praise for Smith herself: of one poem, he says, “Whatever the artistic value of such verses,” what matters is the underlying theme which Wordsworth would later express more masterfully (89). Smith continued to be treated separately as an interesting woman novelist, and a minor pre-Romantic poet, through the 1980s. Smith rose to greater prominence in both of these fields in the 1990s: with work by Stephen Curran, Roger Lonsdale, Jennifer Breen, Andrew Ashfield, and Jacqueline Labbe, “Smith became established not only as a prominent figure in the revised female canon, but also as a central figure in Romanticism” (Duckling 217).

Throughout this history, two aspects of Smith which have troubled critics are her personal life, and her work across genres.



Much scholarship on Smith often takes the stance of *The Literary Encyclopedia* in defining her as a woman who wrote because of, and chiefly about, her personal distress. Antje Blank’s article there highlights Smith’s financial motive to write: “Smith turned to writing when a failing marriage and a costly lawsuit left her without resources to raise her large family” (Blank). “And so,” Blank says, Smith “churned out” her novels (and the many editions of *Elegiac Sonnets*, and her other poetry, and her educational writing) to support herself and her nine children (Blank). Even when Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets “won her the reputation as an author of serious verse,” this is important primarily because it “lent greater respectability to her ensuing productions in a less prestigious but more lucrative genre -- the novel” (Blank). At the same time, Smith cultivated a public persona as a paragon of victimhood and motherhood, suffering deeply but turning her suffering into marketable prose out of a duty to her children. The direct, personal nature of Smith’s writing is, in these accounts, presented as a valuable strength. Fry is not alone in concluding that “\[f\]ew writers have presented themselves in their works so fully as did Charlotte Smith” (3): Smith’s poetry lyricizes her personal experiences, her novels feature autobiographical stand-in characters, and the prefaces framing these works contextualize them in light of her ongoing struggles.



“the often intensely personal pleading prefaces to her novels” (Behrendt 189)



Jacqueline Labbe, however, draws attention to the differences between Smith’s writing personae in different genres, contradicting attempts to interpret Smith’s works as unmediated.

Labbe’s edited volume *Charlotte Smith in British Romanticism* “pulls together many Smiths” \\cite\{Labbe:2008tu p.2\}, integrating scholarship on her poetry, novels, plays, letters, and her reception. Each of these Smiths, the volume contends, has something innovative and unexpected to reveal, important to the formation of British Romanticism. Smith’s novels and poetry have particularly attracted substantial, and substantially separate, scholarship. Labbe observes that Smith’s novels are discussed for their innovative narrative techniques and writerly skill, whereas Smith’s novels are praised for their immediate and personal expressions of Smith’s own interiority. Smith’s letters, less studied, reveal a third kind of writer, one who conceives of herself as a professional businesswoman of her craft. From these distinctions, Labbe concludes that “Smith, significantly, composes herself anew according to genre” \\cite\{Labbe:2008tu p.2\} --- and then asks, “Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres?” \\cite\{Labbe:2008tu p.5\}. \[I also want to know the answer to this question.\]

Labbe is not quite the first to attempt to unify Smith: Carol L. Fry’s 1996 *Charlotte Smith* also addresses her poetry before moving on to several phases of her novel-writing, including the children’s writing which made up much of Smith’s later career but does not appear in Labbe.



Garnai’s *Revolutionary Imaginings in the 1790s* contributes another Smith, a highly political Smith who actively participates in the “political public sphere” conceived by Habermas (despite Habermas’ insistence that women were excluded from this sphere) \\cite\{Garnai:2009tq p.1\}. \[Something about each Smith having her own peers...? Political Smith now becomes peers with Mary Robinson and Elizabeth Inchbald, whereas Poetic Smith is peers with Wordsworth & Coleridge, and Novelistic Smith with Radcliffe etc\]  

Mary Robinson’s first literary foray was the volume *Poems by Mrs. Robinson*, published by C. Parker in 1775, shortly followed by the \[chapbook???\] *Elegiac verses to a young lady on the death of her brother; who was slain in the late engagement at Boston*. “Though *Poems* received little critical support, and made little money, Mary Robinson continued to write” (Mark Ockerbloom), but she would begin her career as an actress before this writing saw publication. Robinson’s theatrical debut as Juliet in December 1776 led to an increasingly acclaimed and prolific career. “She took on a range of roles, sometimes playing multiple parts in the same week, or even night” (Mark Ockerbloom). In 1777 she published a volume of works written earlier, *Captivity, A Poem: and Celadon and Lydia, A Tale*, and in 1778 wrote and starred in her own musical farce, *The Lucky Escape,* from which she published *The Songs, Chorusses, etc. in The Lucky escape, a Comic Opera.* In 1780, Robinson retired from the stage. Her next published volume did not appear until 1791, but the intervening decade was not empty of literary activity. From 1784 to its publication in 1787, Robinson collaborated with Banastre Tarleton on the composition and revision of his *History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781*. In 1788, Robinson began the writing which would make her name as an author. She contributed poems to *The World* and *The Oracle* under the pseudonyms “Laura” and “Laura Maria” which \[responded to the Della Cruscans and made her one of them\].

This dissertation’s decade of interest, 1789-99, captures Robinson’s most prolific period. Her 1790 \[chapbook????\] *Ainsi va le Monde, a poem inscribed to Robert Merry*, published under the name Laura Maria, “Sold better than Merry's poem, requiring a second edition before the end of the year. A watershed event in Robinson's career, proving that she could successfully reinvent herself as a poet and as a political writer” (SOURCE UNCLEAR). The success of her Della Cruscan poetry led to the publication in 1791 of another *Poems by Mrs. Robinson*, this time by J. Bell. “The book was handsomely produced in a leather binding, with gold details. The subscription list of 600 people was headed by His Royal Highness, George, Prince of Wales, and included many other members of the nobility. Some people subscribed because of her writing, some because of her notoriety, and some perhaps out of pity for the former actress, now crippled and ill. Reviews were generally kind, and noted traces in her poems of a sensibility that would later be termed Romanticism.” (Mark Ockerbloom). 1791 also saw the publication of *The Beauties of Mrs. Robinson. Selected and Arranged from her Poetical Works* printed by H. D. Symonds. She also produced a pamphlet that year, *Impartial Reflections on the\[Present\] \[Situation of the\] Queen of France \[by a Friend to Humanity\]*. The next year saw the arrival of a successful novel, *Vancenza, or the Dangers of Credulity*, which would reach five editions by 1794, and two elegiac \[chapbooks???????\]: *Monody to the Memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds*, and *An ode to the harp of the late accomplished and amiable Lousia Hanway*. 1793 saw three more \[chapbooks??????\], two of poetry under her own name (*Monody to the Memory of the late Queen of France* and *Sight, The Cavern of Woe and Solitude*) and one under the pseudonym “Horace Juvenal,” *Modern Manners: a poem in two cantos.* In 1794 she published her second novel, *The Widow, or a Picture of Modern Times*. In 1795 she published another novel, *Audley Fortescue*, under the name “Mr. Robinson.” In 1796 she published four major works:, the novel *Angelina*, under her own name, as “Mrs. Mary Robinson, Author of Poems, Vancenza, the Widow, &C. &C. &C.”; another novel also under her own name, *Hubert de Sevrac*; a sonnet series *Sappho and Phaon*; and the gothic verse tragedy *The Sicilian Lover*. 1797 saw two more novels: *Julie St. Lawrence* and *Walsingham*. 1798 was Robinson’s first year since 1790 with no publications. In 1799, she published two novels, *The False Friend* and *The Natural Daughter*, as well as a political treatise, *A Letter to the Women of England on the Cruelties of Mental Subordination.* She also began contributing weekly essays to the *Morning Post and Gazetteer*.

After 1799 (and thus after this dissertation’s decade of interest), Robinson’s career and life is short. In 1800, she publishes a novel, *Ellinda: or the abbey of St. Aubert,* her verse collection *Lyrical Tales,* a \[chapbook???\] of her freestanding *The Mistletoe, a Christmas Tale* (as Laura Maria), and a translation from the German of Joseph Hager’s *Picture of Palermo.* Robinson dies in December 1800. After her death, her daughter Mary Elizabeth Robinson, oversaw the posthumous publication of three more works: *Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself, with some posthumous pieces in verse* (1801), a collection of poetry titled *The Wild Wreath* (1804), and a final collection of *The Poetical Works of the Late Mrs. Robinson, including many pieces never before published* (1806).  

Mary Robinson’s early biography shares striking resonances with that of Charlotte Smith. Robinson was also married at the age of sixteen to a man who squandered his income. Robinson spent more than a year in King’s Bench debtors’ prison with her husband and infant daughter, from 1774 to 1775, from which she published her first volume of poetry. Rather than immediately taking up the mantle of a professional author, however, in 1776 she became an actress. As an actress, she met increasing success for four seasons --- so much so that she attracted the attention in 1779 of the 17-year-old Prince of Wales, who determined to make her his mistress. After a period of semi-public flirtation, Robinson agreed, and retired from the stage. “Although the affair lasted less than a year, 'the Perdita' was notorious from then on; her gowns, her carriages, and her alliances became a constant source of discussion and speculation in the newspapers” (Mark Ockerbloom). The Prince of Wales had given her a bond of £20,000, but refused to pay. “She demanded £25,000 for the return of the prince's letters. She apparently settled for £5,000, paid by George III ‘to get my son out of this shameful scrape.’ It was enough to stave off her creditors. In 1782, Mary obtained a further £500 annuity for herself, and a £200 annuity during the life of Maria Elizabeth, in return for the surrender of the Prince's bond.” (Mark Ockerbloom). Robinson continued to live in high society and the public eye, involved with Lord Malden, and then with Colonel Banastre Tarleton in a relationship which would be her longest. In 1783, Tarleton’s debts grew pressing, and his family attempted to sever his relationship with Robinson by promising to pay them if he removed to France without her. He left England in July 1783. Robinson, pregnant, borrowed money for his debts and set out alone to intercept him in Dover. The rough travel led to a miscarriage, the mistreatment of which ultimately paralyzed Robinson’s legs and left her with acutely painful rheumatism the rest of her life. Tarleton and Robinson lived variously in France, Germany, and England, variously together and apart, for the next five years. At one point, while Tarleton lived with Robinson in England, “Mary's possessions were seized and auctioned off. She saved only the diamond-studded portrait of the Prince of Wales” (Mark Ockerbloom). In 1788, Tarleton’s fortunes and Robinson’s health had recovered enough for her to move from France back to England, and the two established neighbouring households on Clarges Street in London. Over the next decade, they continued their relationship, while Tarleton’s political career and Robinson’s literary one both flourished. In 1797, Tarleton ended the relationship, and in 1798 married a young heiress, to Robinson’s dismay. Her health worsened, and she died 26 December 1800, aged 43.  

We misapprehend Smith, More, and Robinson because we expect something more like Radcliffe.  

Ann Radcliffe stands in contrast to More, Smith, and Robinson in many ways. One of these is the relative brevity of her bibliography. She published six works during this dissertation’s decade of interest, five novels and a volume of travel writing, and this is all that is published during her lifetime. In 1789, she publishes *The Castles of Athlin* and *Dunbayne*. In 1790, *A Sicilian Romance*. In 1791, *The Romance of the Forest*, which captured the public’s attention and made her name. In 1794, *The Mysteries of Udolpho*. Radcliffe was paid £500 for this work, which was a highly-anticipated sensation (Facer). In 1795, she publishes a work of travel writing, *A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794*. In 1797, she publishes the last novel to be published during her lifetime, *The Italian*. She was paid £800 for *The Italian*. She retired from writing after this final novel, and lived twenty-five more years without a publication. After this dissertation’s decade of interest, in 1826, her husband published several pieces posthumously: a final novel *Gaston de Blondeville*; a poetic piece *St. Alban’s Abbey, a metrical tale; with some poetical pieces...To which is prefixed a memoir of the author, with extracts from her journals*; and, in *New Monthly Magazine*, her unfinished essay “On the Supernatural in Poetry”.  

Radcliffe’s biography, too, is short. Radcliffe never cultivated a public literary persona, which itself led to the development of a mythos of her seclusion. “According to The Edinburgh Review (May 1823), ‘She never appeared in public, nor mingled in private society, but kept herself apart, like the sweet bird that sings its solitary notes, shrouded and unseen’. In fact, so little was known about Radcliffe’s life in the nineteenth century that Christina Rossetti abandoned a projected biography due to a lack of material” (Facer). Some simple facts are known. She was the only child of a William Ward, a haberdasher at her birth who later managed a china shop. Radcliffe was married at age 23, to William Radcliffe, “a hardworking Oxford law graduate who became part-editor and owner of *The English Chronicle*.” Unlike Smith and Robinson’s husbands, Mr. Radcliffe appears to have used the household’s funds soberly and responsibly, and respected his wife’s intellect. The ‘origin story’ of Radcliffe’s writing is, therefore, not one of independence and desperation. Instead, Facer says, “He often came home late and in order to occupy her time, Radcliffe began to write, reading aloud the lines she had written during the day on his return” (Facer). The Radcliffes used the extra money from the publication of her novels to travel (Facer). When Radcliffe ceased writing after 1797, she was said to be depressed (Facer), but she also may have preferred a return to more private life. Rumours of depression escalated into rumours of madness; in the absence of information, many suggested that the Gothic nature of her novels had driven her insane and she was in an asylum (Facer). “Talfourd’s *Memoir of the Author* ... categorically denies that she was insane: ‘while some spoke of her as dead, and others represented her as afflicted with mental alienation, she was thankfully enjoying the choicest of blessings of life’” (Facer). Her death in 1823 appears to have been from a severe attack of the asthma which she had been suffering from for the past twelve years.   

In contrast to the brevity of Radcliffe’s bibliography and biography stands the mountain of secondary writing on her works.  

As these four author introductions indicate, \[MY CONCLUSIONS ON THEM.\] As future chapters will explore in more detail, each author can make claims of “popularity” and “importance,” but also “obscurity.”



#### 1.1.1.3.  theory ####  

The digital humanities and the eighteenth century are my primary subject matter, but I am also deliberately employing certain theoretical frameworks in my thinking. In the ‘venn diagram’ of three fields[ this doesn't make sense to a reader (I know what you mean, others won't)], the ‘queer theory’[ I feel like I really shouldn’t shorthand all this stuff as “queer theory,” since I’m not persuaded that eg Felski is at ALL a ‘queer theorist’ --- but it all comes from Sedgwick for me, and I do need some kind of name for this collection of ideas --- and my own attachment to Felski is tied to queerness] circle is smaller, but no less important. My primary theoretical framework is that of reparative reading. Eve Sedgwick persuasively describes, in “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading,” the dominance of paranoia in literary criticism \\cite\{Sedgwick:2003up\}, and attempts to sketch an alternative in what she terms  reparative reading. My touchstones are two descriptions from Sedgwick’s original chapter, “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading”:  

The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self. \\cite\{Sedgwick:2003up p.149\}

What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them. \\cite\{Sedgwick:2003up pp.150-151\} 

What Sedgwick describes, here, is a “desire,” not a methodology.  I do not (yet?) claim that my work *is* reparative, and certainly struggle to point to specific methodological decisions to draw a roadmap for reparative work generally. Nonetheless, this desire is at the core of my impulse toward the problems of canons, and of literature in turbulent times, and therefore I note it explicitly here. One reason I seek to go back to the simple, basic questions of ‘what was printed’ and ‘what was popular’ and ‘what was important’ [ in your last section, you really need to make it clear this is what you are doing: because right now it is not clear.]is that I fear that previous forays into these questions have been limited by paranoia. I therefore understand “reparative reading” to refer, not to a precise set of practices, but to a position one might occupy in relation to a text. The reparative position is a generous one, both in terms of giving of oneself to a text, and in terms of seeking a text’s strengths over its weaknesses.  

Implicit in my prioritization of reparative reading is an affinity for queer theory more broadly. I take it as read, for example, that history consists of major discontinuities in cultural ontology and identity, as Foucault describes. I follow Judith Butler in understanding these historically-framed identities as being “performative,” actively re-created in conversation between self and others. (In my understanding of performative identity creation I also borrow from J.L. Austin, who is not typically understood as a ‘queer theorist,’ but who contributes valuable vocabulary for how words do things.)



##### 1.1.1.3.1.  not close reading #####



Generosity is often assumed to be[ passivity!] an affect which it is only possible to assume in conjunction with textual intimacy; that is to say, reparative reading is often assumed to entail *close* reading[ assumed by whom?]. However, I contend that generosity can occur at any scale. Rita Felski provides valuable theoretical insight for reparative readers who do not wish to be (only) close readers. Felski, in her article “After Suspicion” and then further in her monograph *The Limits of Critique*, frames the core question animated by Sedgwick’s conundrum as “Can we be postcritical --- as distinct from uncritical?” \\cite\{Felski:2015lc p.151\}. For Felski, the answer lies in attending seriously to literary attachments, including our own attachments as critics. Felski’s approach to these attachments is essentially sociological, drawing heavily on Bruno Latour’s actor-network-theory \\cite\{Latour:2005vh\}, and thus involves almost no close reading. Felski does accord serious attention to textual effects in her work under the umbrella of what she terms“neophenomenology,” as first described in her “Everyday Aesthetics” \\cite\{Felski:2009um\}, does accord more attention to textual effects. (This is where the “neo” arrives in “neophenomenology,” as Felski distinguishes herself from earlier phenomenologists who treat textual content as almost irrelevant to the meaning-making carried out by readers.) Nonetheless, rather than explicating individual texts, Felski’s neophenomenological[ if you are going to draw on this you prob need to work out what is meant by phenomenological - more weeks of reading. Maybe elide it.] work seeks to address the phenomenon of reading itself. My own work is neither sociological nor neophenomenological, but like Felski I undertake reparative, postcritical reading without close reading.  

My search for other ways of relating to literature has also led me to emerging work under the umbrella of “surface reading”. “Surface reading” positions itself as an alternative to “symptomatic reading”; rather than seeking to expose hidden truths concealed within texts, it attempts accurate descriptions that “make visible what is invisible only because it's too much on the surface of things” \\cite\{Best:2016ve p.13\}. The analogues to reparative and paranoid reading are obvious, but not perfect: all paranoid reading is symptomatic, but not all symptomatic reading is paranoid[ unpack]. The tensions between these two modes of reading are explored in more detail in A.C. Facundo’s *Oscillations of Literary Theory: The Paranoid Imperative and Queer Reparative* \\cite\{Facundo:2iP388Oj\}. Reparative reading, as described by Sedgwick, is often still interested in ‘deep’ meanings of texts, in which striking textual features can be interpreted to locate additional meanings. As a result, much of the work produced by queer theory is symptomatic even when it’s not paranoid --- and it’s often paranoid.

In contrast, “surface reading,” as Heather Love describes, pursues “a turn away from the singularity and richness of individual texts” \\cite\{Love:2010cv p.374\}, seeking descriptions are “complex and variegated, but not rich, warm, or deep” \\cite\{Love:2010cv p.378\}. Love’s disavowal of “richness” here is part of her attempt to move away from “the ethical charisma of the literary translator or messenger” \\cite\{Love:2010cv p.374\} who characterizes the paranoid, critical figure that both Sedgwick and Felski also seek to escape. The rejection of this figure also informs Love’s approach to description:

Good descriptions are in a sense rich, but not because they truck with imponderables like human experience or human nature. They are close, but they are not deep; rather than adding anything “extra” to the description, they account for the real variety that is already there. \\cite\{Love:2010cv p.377\}

Love’s articulation of this mode of is, partly, struggling with the task of describing something which does not yet fully exist. Her later article, “Close Reading and Thin Description,” provides a more precise articulation of the kind of close reading that she calls for, in which an “exhaustive, fine-grained attention to phenomena” \\cite\{Love:2013cu p.404\} enables “taking up the position of the device; by turning oneself into a camera, one could---at least ideally---pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully” \\cite\{Love:2013cu p.407\}. Although Love is somewhat uninterested in “distant reading” as synonymous with Moretti \\cite\{Love:2013cu p.411\}, this invocation of the mechanical[ you need to be clearer than the word "mechanical" about how you get from "camera" to "computation" - is a computer like a camera, is it mechanical?] implies, I argue, an obvious potential for computation. It is in order to create room for computation that I pay particular attention to Love’s earlier, more tentative discussion of description as a literary practice. Computational distant reading cannot answer Love’s call for “a model for close reading after the decline of the linguistic turn” \\cite\{Love:2013cu p.404\}, since it is not close reading, but computation does enable *closeness* without depth. As I will discuss more fully in \[FUTURE SECTION\], a good computational model is unlikely to “truck with imponderables,” but it *absolutely* *must* “account for the real variety that is already there” or else one’s code will simply fail to run.[ this is so important - you need more of it, perhaps right from the start]



##### 1.1.1.3.2.  conclusion #####



By marrying “surface reading” and “distant reading” I may seem to leave “reparative reading” behind: after all, Felski’s call for postcritical analysis explicitly suggests, “Sometimes serious thinking calls for a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance” (CITE). However, Felski then defines a decrease of distance as “a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments”: this, I insist, can be done at any scale.



### 1.1.2.  synthesis of 3 fields ###  

Drawing together three scholarly conversations with three distinct histories --- the digital humanities, the literary canons of 1790s[ I think perhaps the key for this section is not to do "1790s" but . - printing and canons in 1790s (and recognize they need to be separate as well as intersecting)], and reparative reading --- it is difficult to attentively delineate the links and the tensions between each thread. Especially since many of these fields have, in fact, overlapped substantially, there is a danger of simplistically conflating distinct lines of thoughts. At the same time, over-emphasis on distinctions can overstate the separations between fields which do in fact (as the existence of this dissertation contents) share important affinities. To navigate these conceptual overlaps carefully, let us[ choose your pronoun and stick to it. I only like "we" when I am referring to 'academics as a profession - the let us we always seems pompous to me: better to use I, as you have previously] make our way through each area of an imagined Venn diagram of the three. We can discuss each pair in turn --- DH and eighteenth century studies; eighteenth century studies and queer theory; queer theory and DH --- to make our way toward the centre where all three overlap.



#### 1.1.2.1.  DH & 1790s ####  

lit review of other DH work done on the 18thC? Maybe, common methods used?  

Eighteenth century materials of various kinds have been collected in many digital archives, of very different scopes. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. On the tip of anyone’s tongue, of course, is Gale’s Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), containing over 180,000 titles 1701-1800, of which 42,000 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. ECCO is itself (mostly) a subset of the broader English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), which contains more 460,000 texts 1473-1800, of which 51,965 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799 (indicating that nearly 10,000 titles in the decade appear in the ESTC but not ECCO). The ESTC does not provide access to texts themselves: instead, it is an authoritative bibliographic catalogue, available as a searchable database. It is ECCO which provides texts: ECCO’s 180,000 titles works are available as photographed facsimiles of the full text of each title. The facsimiles can be searched within ECCO’s online interface; these searches examine a plaintext version of the facsimile pages that was generated by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but this OCR text is not made directly available. As a result, the facsimiles may be read individually by scholars, but cannot form the basis for computational corpus analysis. A subset of ECCO’s texts have been hand-prepared, as part of the Text Creation Partnership (TCP), to be easier to use in computational research. The resulting corpus of ECCO-TCP texts contains 2,231 titles, of which 466 were printed in England between 1789 and 1799. These titles are available as carefully-edited texts encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard, which not only provides an accurate version of the text’s words, but encodes substantial details regarding its context on the page. Most large-scale distant reading of eighteenth century literature relies in the ECCO-TCP corpus as its ‘model’ or ‘sample’ to represent the period[ ref examples above]. Accordingly, one of the tasks of this dissertation is to examine the makeup of this corpus, and how it differs both from other corpora and from print culture in the period itself. These three digital collections --- ECCO, ESTC, and ECCO-TCP --- are the primary digital resources for the period, which form the basis of most digital research. However, they represent only one approach toward the collection and presentation of digital texts, to which there are two broad kinds of alternatives. These large but meticulous collections occupy a middle space between, on the one hand, highly selective thematic collections, such as The Shelley-Godwin Archive, of which there are many, and the giants of indiscriminate textual accumulation, such as Google Books, of which there are few.  

Smaller collections allow for more scholarly curation, but have corresponding limitations. Whereas the ‘main players’ can be easily enumerated for the mega-archives, these specialized collections are numerous. Some will focus on particular kinds of texts, such as the Early Novels Database (2,041 novels 1700-1799) or Broadside Ballads Online (more than 30,000 broadside ballads). Others exhaustively index particular publications, such as The Hampshire Chronicle, the Index to the Lady’s Magazine (1770 to 1818), or the Novels Reviewed Database (1,836 reviews from The Critical Review and The Monthly Review, 1790-1820). Feminist scholarship in particular has seen the creation of resources like the Orlando Project, the Chawton House library Novels Online, Northeastern University’s Women Writers Online and UC Davis’s British Women Romantic Poets. The virtue of these collections is that they achieve even greater accuracy and comprehensiveness within their defined scope. The Shelley-Godwin Archive, for example, can reasonably aspire to digitize *every* known manuscript of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, and to provide these manuscripts in hand-encoded plaintext transcripts. However, as is inevitable, these specialized archives have the vices of their virtues: their specialized focus allows them to adapt precisely to their materials, and their idiosyncratic data structures can rarely be combined with other resources. The William Blake Archive, for example, benefits enormously from designing its archive around the unique images of each page of each copy of each of Blake’s works. But because this approach is so well-suited to Blake, it cannot be applied beyond Blake. Even if the archive’s resources were available for download, they could not be directly compared to materials from another source which does not record its information at such a minute level of detail.  

The best known mega-archive is Google Books. In a scholarly context, one hesitates even to designate this as an “archive,” particularly in the same breath as resources like ECCO: books of all kinds are scanned indiscriminately with only the bare minimum of roughly-accurate metadata collected about them. Books are sourced from libraries whose collections are being scanned in bulk, or are submitted directly by publishers or authors who are attracted by Google’s call to “Promote your books on Google---for free” (CITE[^cf12]).   These rapidly-scanned books are prone to unpredictable errors, including inaccurate dates, misspellings, duplicate copies, and inaccurate subject classifications (Harper 2016; Jacsó 2008; Weiss 2016) (CITE Mike Sutton and Mark D. Griffiths) --- infamously, many books have “1899” assigned as their publication date because this date was used as a placeholder for “no date”.[^cf13] Many photographed pages still include the fingers of the employee holding open the book. Nonetheless, Google Books is frequently used to study the prevalence of various “n-grams” (words or short phrases) over time, thanks to Google’s built-in tool. The tool is able to search books which are, for copyright restrictions, not available directly to readers, making it highly tempting for questions about contemporary language use. Similar in scope to Google Books but with more limited research tools is The Internet Archive. The Internet Archive, unlike Google Books, is a non-profit, but like Google Books, it carries out mass scanning of books. The Internet Archive declares that it contains 20 million books and texts, and scans 1,000 books per day in 28 locations around the world (CITE).[^cf14] Equivalent numbers are not currently published for Google Books, but in 2013 books were scanned at the rate of 1,000 pages per hour[ honestly there's something really interesting to me about how google books, internet archive, etc use the same kind of rhetorical hyperbole and positioning as Hannah More -- it seems to be a 'branding' move that relies on a certain kind of belief in 'print magic' and the liberating power of VOLUME of print (some kind of 'accessibility magic'?) -- of course, book google books and Hannah More are probably bullshitting in order to make money. And their bullshit makes academic work difficult......], and in 2015 more than 25 million books had been scanned. Google Books, Project Gutenberg, and the Internet Archive are not “canonical” sources of texts, but they are nonetheless part of the ecosystem of digital eighteenth century studies.

  

Moreover, as in eighteenth-century texts themselves, the boundary between “canonical” and “noncanonical” digital archives is a permeable one: Google Books and the Internet Archive, distinctly ‘noncanonical’ archives, are also integrated into HathiTrust, an increasingly popular ‘canonical’ resource for scholars[ you need to have done more on canon to make this work



bc here you do not mean, 'canonical texts of the 1790s containing' but - more authoritative - right?]. HathiTrust’s collection contains digitized content from “a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house member institution initiatives” \\cite\{HathiTrust:2019vs\}. The “in-house member institutions” are six consortia (such as the University of California state university system), and one hundred and forty-nine individual universities and colleges \\cite\{HathiTrust:2019ti\}. The aggregate scholarly authority of these institutions carries the weight of elevating HathiTrust above the Google Books scans which form the backbone of much of its contents: “The members ensure the reliability and efficiency of the digital library,” the website assures us, “by relying on community standards and best practices” \\cite\{HathiTrust:2019vs\}. The collection itself is always expanding: the website contains a dedicated set of instructions for “Getting Content Into HathiTrust,” providing an “Ingest Checklist” for those who might contribute either existing or new digitized content \\cite\{HathiTrust:2019tf\}. The texts themselves are all stored as facsimile page images and full-text OCR transcripts. In order to comply with copyright law, however, HathiTrust only provides large-scale downloads and OCR transcripts for texts which are in the public domain. What does, in fact, distinguish HathiTrust from similar repositories is its commitment to enabling fair use and research-based access to texts as much as possible. Rather than favouring maximum restriction of access in order to ensure maximum protection from legal complaints, HathiTrust has innovated several ways to allow scholars to carry out text-mining analysis on copyrighted texts. The scholarly benefit of HathiTrust is most evident, therefore, in the study of contemporary literature, where copyright has been a major barrier to study. However, eighteenth-century texts are so firmly in the public domain that copyright issues rarely arise; instead, the major challenge in building large-scale corpora of transcripts (rather than facsimiles) is the resistance of eighteenth century typefaces to OCR. Especially since many eighteenth-century digital facsimiles are themselves fascimiles of microfiche (with resulting loss of image fidelity), running an eighteenth century page image through OCR software generally produces useless gibberish[ you perhaps need more on the shitload of work being done on OCR - maybe in the next chapter]. As a result, HathiTrust’s key intervention --- using OCR to circumvent copyright restrictions --- has limited applicability to eighteenth-century studies.  

As this survey of eighteenth-century digital archives shows, there is no ‘perfect’ corpus for large-scale study of eighteenth-century texts. Moreover, I argue, the imperfect samples which each archive provides are shaped not only by historical factors of eighteenth-century print culture, but also by contemporary digital culture. Each archive represents a unique set of choices in response to the same sets of questions: what to include, why, how; what to make accessible, why, how, to whom; what, in the end, makes a text matter, and what we are meant to *do* with texts. As this dissertation will argue more fully in Chapter 2, these questions of digital history have important resonance with literary questions about literary canon formation[ so . this section is meant to be one of interesections - I think it's good, almost as is, but needs more that brings you towards the intersections with 1790s, canon, print points: perhaps this in lieu of some of the detail on e.g. Hathi which then really can go in ch. 2].  

As Suarez notes, the ESTC is a unique resource for pre-19thC works: “Regrettably, although this volume of The Cambridge history of the book in Britain ends in 1830, it is not possible to perform a similarly comprehensive analysis for the first decades of the nineteenth century because we have no equivalent bibliographical control for this period” (Suarez 40).



#### 1.1.2.2.  1790s & queer ####



##### 1.1.2.2.1.  intro #####



\[Probable intended structure for this section: one of my concerns is the way that 18thC studies ends ups segregated by genre (even though writers don’t confine themselves to one genre); so here’s the conversation in poetry, in the novel, in drama; and here’s how they’re all engaged in the same question about ‘trash’ vs ‘treasure’; and here’s how that dichotomy employs the same techniques of obnoxiously defining ‘literature’ through a rejection of the ‘popular’, sticking us with Wordsworth, Walter Scott, and a sainted Shakespeare; and here’s John Mee and ‘print magic’ tying them together.\]



##### 1.1.2.2.2.  print magic #####



###### 1.1.2.2.2.1.  Mee ######



Poetry thus stands in a stark contrast to the volumes of writing which John Mee discusses in *Print, Publicity, and Popular Radicalism in the 1790s.* Although his title leaves open the possibility that he could consider any kind of writing in print, Mee is concerned solely with the activities of the London Corresponding Society, placed in the context of Romanticism. He examines “public lectures, toasting, tavern debates, and song, but also more mundane and less colourful associational practices, such as day-to-day editorial discussion about what to publish under the LCS’s name” \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.28\}. These writers held a fundamentally different relationship to the print marketplace than the Romantic poets, or even than theatre critics: rather than concerning themselves with distinctions between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ forms of writing or publication, Mee argues, “At certain points the societies seem to operate under the spell of ‘print magic’, that is, a faith that print could liberate mankind simply by bringing ideas into printed circulation”[ this is connected to paranoid reading - faith in exposure qua exposure - extractive logic



I wrote that in the cafe and have no idea what I mean by it. I wonder though if you might do some rearranging of this whole section around the idea of "print magic" and "cultural capital" - cool.] \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.24\}. This partly shifts to Mee himself the task of assessing whether the texts he studies are ‘literature.’ A partial claim to the status of ‘literature’ is suggested by the participation of his book within the series ‘Cambridge Studies in Romanticism,’ which, he acknowledges “implies an understanding of popular radicalism as a kind of ‘literary’ culture. At least, it argues for the centrality of the writing, production, and circulation of printed texts that took up so much of the time of the radical societies” \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.18[ “this formation and the associated identification of the literary with what John Thelwall called ‘sallies of the imagination’ were the product of a crisis brought on by the emergence of the popular radical culture opened up in this book, but the story is not a straightforward one. Thelwall himself could identify ‘literature’ both with a domain of imagination separable from politics and with print as the principal engine of emancipatory change.” (Mee 18)]\}. Nonetheless, the book distances itself from “Romanticism and its major poets, novelists, and playwrights” \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.18\}. Mee thus replicates the distance that the period’s “poets, novelists, and playwrights” sought to put between themselves as the “the role of print personality[^cf15] as a form of mediation” \\cite\{Mee:2016wk p.29\} that interests Mee in the LCS.



##### 1.1.2.2.3.  poetry #####



###### 1.1.2.2.3.1.  Bainbridge ######



The desire to distinguish between “trash” and “treasure” also appears in studies of poetry, which in this period are nearly synonymous with studies of Romantic poetry. Particularly where poetry is examined in light of conflicts with France, analysis of poets’ work often doubles as an analysis of their success or failure in the pursuit of cultural capital[ yeah, so you need a whole bit on this]. For example, Simon Bainbridge, in *British Poetry and the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars*, sees the decade and its poetry through the lens of war. His own interest is in what he terms “the attempts made by several writers to fill the role of national bard prior to Scott” \\cite\{Bainbridge:2003uk p.3\}. This framework leads Bainbridge to examine Charlotte Smith alongside Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey, and eventually Walter Scott. In his conception of ‘a national bard’ he imagines a particular marriage of poetry’s special status as imaginative literature to a specific poet’s cultivation of a nationally important public persona. Both poetry and the poet are thus pursuing a particular kind of cultural capital that allows them to rise above their own popularity. Bainbridge frequently discusses strategies of print publication as part of his analysis: a particularly insightful footnote discusses, for example, a poem which circulated both as an ode in a magazine and as lyrics in a broadsheet. Bainbridge observes that “texts could shift in status and meaning as they were adapted for different forms of production and different audiences, in this case existing in both the relatively elevated form of the ode, to be read by an individual magazine reader, and as a new set of lyrics to a traditional tune, achieving its fullest realization in a communal performance at a political meeting in an alehouse or at a demonstration” \\cite\{Bainbridge:2003uk p.10\}. However, his explanations of individual print strategies are often hindered by his approach to literature’s cultural capital[ since I am on about it, what you need is Guillory and Bourdieu, Field of Cultural Production. And what you need to acknowledge is that these are now pretty old (80s) basic ideas about literature, but still very useful to you as they are to others, even as your approach - corpora, history of the book - takes them in new directions,]. At one point, for example, he argues that “the fact that the Gentleman’s Magazine was forced to reproduce at length a poem written two decades previously again emphasizes what was seen to be the failure of anyone convincingly to fill the role of the Bard until the emergence of Walter Scott” \\cite\{Bainbridge:2003uk p.53\}. I contend that the republication of substantially older works of literature is not a sign that England was destitute of true poetry before Walter Scott, but rather an attempt to solve the challenges to national identity posed by the 1790s’ disruption of history.



###### 1.1.2.2.3.2.  Cronin ######



Bainbridge is not alone is taking Walter Scott[ talk about Scott's flaws more explicitly -- the Clansmen, also the book Felski mentions about the afterlives of Walter Scott] as a kind of pinnacle, and looking backwards in search of his antecedents. Richard Cronin, in *The Politics of Romantic Poetry*, concerns himself with “poetry that speaks to a divided society in an attempt to constitute its readers as citizens of \[...\] ‘the pure commonwealth’” \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.13\}. This definition of “political poetry” leads him to Erasmus Darwin as the poet of the the Revolution and the Revolutionary war, William Blake as the poet of the Napoleonic wars, and Richard Southey and Walter Savage Landor as the poets of the post-war period --- ending, irresistibly, as so many do, with Walter Scott. Despite the fact that Cronin’s chief interest is in each poet’s use of language to construct an ideal audience, print culture looms. Of Erasmus Darwin, Cronin emphasizes Darwin’s use of “\[t\]he most powerful of the languages available in the 1790s that could plausibly claim universal status,” namely, “the language of science” \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.16\}, but it is the “beautifully and expensively produced edition of The Botanic Garden” \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.29\} which asserts his importance. Blake’s eccentric, idiosyncratic language is mirrored in his eccentric, idiosyncratic printing practices \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.60\}. Southey and Landor’s universal, international language seeks to “escape from history” \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.81\}, which entails disavowing not only the popular prose fictions which sought to represent history but also the very circulating libraries in which they were distributed \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.74\}. In other words, Cronin, even more so than Bainbridge, seems to use ‘poetic language’ to explain phenomena which have important print culture dimensions. Nonetheless, his discussion of Scott accurately describes the particular nature of Scott’s success: “Scott’s *Minstrelsy* transforms ballads freely passed from speaker to speaker around cottage fires on the Scottish Borders into luxury items, items only available to book-buyers of some means” \\cite\{Cronin:2000vz p.94\}. The Romantic poets, in both Bainbridge and Cronin’s accounts, support their claims to insight and importance through the inaccessibility of their work in print.

###### 1.1.2.2.4.2.  history of the novel ######



Both during the eighteenth century and in subsequent critical reception, the literature of the 1790s seemed to present a queer problem: what are we to make of the Gothic? After discussing some histories of the eighteenth century novel both excluding and including the Gothic as a general category, I will turn to the specific cases of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis to discuss the queerness of these debates about literature and genre.



####### 1.1.2.2.4.2.1.  history of the novel #######



The ‘history of the novel’ often finds it necessary to simply skip over the Gothic. \[ADD CONSERVATIVE HISTORIES OF THE NOVEL HERE --- Kiely, Tompkins, etc\]



###### 1.1.2.2.4.3.  female gothic ######



There is a tension underlying the study of a female Gothic, which Yael Shapira articulates in her review of Diana Wallace’s ambitious *Female Gothic Histories*: “The very continuity that allows us to call this body of writing a ‘tradition’ raises issues of interpretive method: how do we analyze women’s writing that, over such a long period of time, repeatedly turns to the same set of conventions --- conventions that, moreover, involve female suffering and fear --- without collapsing different authors and their varied aesthetic achievements into an essentialist view of gender and into a single narrative of female victimhood?” (Shapira 191). Shapira dubs this “the tension between historicist and universalist approaches to women’s Gothic” (191), both of which have much of value to contribute. This tension overlaps that between definitions focused on the representation of gender within texts, and definitions focused on the biographical gender of their authors: that is, between female writing and women’s writing. Study of the early Gothic can easily conflate the two. The “obviously” female-associated phenomenon of Gothic excess led to the critical category of the “Female Gothic” to discuss narratives of women in patriarchal distress. Ellen Ledoux lists off the standard requirements: “a distressed heroine, domestic incarceration, threats of sexual violence, anxiety about monstrous or absent mothers,” and “economic disenfranchisement” (2). A definition based on the theme of female persecution enabled work like Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s *Madwoman in the Attic* (1979), Kate Ferguson Ellis’s *The Contested Castle* (1989), Eugenia DeLamotte’s *Perils of the Night* (1990), and Helene Meyers’s *Femicidal Fears* (2001) to examine specifically female experiences of the threats of patriarchy, and to take their literary depictions seriously. As their titles show, these works \[pursue \[individual kinds of fears/themes/motifs\] / use the particularity of \[motifs?\] thematic “continuities that seem to transcend historical difference” (Shapira 191) to tie texts together.\] Concurrently, a definition based on female authorship enables Juliann Fleenor’s *The Female Gothic* (1983), Diane Long Hoeveler’s *Gothic Feminism* (1998), Emma Clery’s *Women’s Gothic* (2000), and Donna Heiland’s *Gothic and Gender* (2004) \[to turn their attention to gender itself / make claims on the scale of gender.\] \[These can get expansive in scope, as in Pickering and Chatto’s 5-volume series Varieties of Female Gothic (2002) or Avril Horner’s and Sue Zlosnik’s Edinburgh Companion on Women and the Gothic (2016), which \[indeed grapple with variety\]\] \[I am not the first, therefore, to distinguish between female gothic and women’s gothic\] \[I follow this latter set of footsteps more closely, beginning with women and then asking if what they wrote matches what we expect from female writing (make clear that I still approve of female gothic work)\] \[My own work is women’s gothic and historicist? My work seeks to see whether women’s gothic and female gothic do diverge?\]



The long history and continuing use of the Female Gothic framework stands in a striking contrast to the dearth of work on the Male Gothic. Even though the Gothic is a context in which men are assumed to be famously outnumbered, the status of “male” as a cultural default means their works are “unmarked” or assumed to be defined by things other than gender. The Female Gothic is often treated as synonymous with the explained supernatural, or the ‘terror’ mode in the terror/horror distinction, but no terminology is used for the ‘unexplained supernatural,’ and horror works by men are called ‘horror’, rather than Male Gothic. The few explicit identifications of a male mode of writing begin with the female and define the male as its lack or opposite. Ellen Ledoux, for example, in the context of attaching the Female Gothic to “the ‘explained supernatural style,’” adds a definition for the Male Gothic, “in which ghosts, devils and other supernatural phenomena demand a willful suspension of disbelief from the reader.”[^cf16] David Richter provides definitions based on plot structures: “The ‘female Gothic’ is ... a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The ‘male Gothic’ is a punitive tragedy...in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure.”[^cf17] Even when scholars take the male gothic seriously at length,[^cf18] the male gothic must have its female binary opposite; it cannot be defined on its own terms.[ (Should I delete this footnote? Should I move this to the body?? “I think it's fine as a fn., but in future iterations, if the contents become more central to the main text, you can also incorporate part or all of it.”) Searching in several different databases for the phrase “male gothic” inevitably turns up pages and pages of titles about the *female* gothic. The only work I can find which defines its subject matter as first and foremost the *male* gothic is Joseph Andriano’s 1993 Jungian monograph *Our Ladies of Darkness: Feminine Daemonology in Male Gothic Fiction*, which, as its title indicates, requires the female in order to define the male. Searching for “men’s gothic” is one of the most shockingly useless web searches I have ever undertaken: some databases can locate as many as four results, others only *one ---* always irrelevant. (The top result is always a 1977 journal article by E. Miller Budick entitled “The Fall of the House: A Reappraisal of Poe's Attitudes toward Life and Death”, which happens to use the phrase “men’s gothic” in passing.) Searching for “female gothic” or “women’s gothic”, of course, reveals a deluge of research.]



Work that complicates our image the Female Gothic --- like work that challenges the conventional image of Radcliffean imitators ---  is not new. Almost as soon as the term came into use, scholars have been pushing against its boundaries, grappling with the true diversity of women’s Gothic writing[^cf19]. Nonetheless, however, even as Gothic studies grew more complex in other ways, this definition offered something useful in identifying and providing vocabulary for a particular set of texts, so it has been impressively stable. The terms “Female Gothic” and “women’s gothic” are both in currency[^cf20]. Ledoux argues persuasively that “the category ‘Female Gothic’ more accurately reflects the ideological goals of second-wave feminist literary criticism than it represents the narratives of early women Gothic writers.”[^cf21] Despite many scholars’ work showing that “women’s early Gothic writing--- a great deal of which is only accessible to us because of the recovery work of feminist scholars---is much more aesthetically, politically, thematically, and generically diverse than the Female Gothic categorization suggests,” and despite ongoing critical work to refine the term Female Gothic, she finds that “its usage has limited the ways in which scholars approach women’s Gothic writing.”[^cf22] Ledoux set out to “to explain why the discrepancy between available primary textual material and textual analysis exists and how it came to be,”[^cf23] a task which she accomplishes successfully through a carefully close-read history of nineteenth and twentieth century literary politics.

###### 1.1.2.2.5.1.  Taylor ######



I am by no means the first to examine the writing of the 1790s in light of authors’ political strategies[ is that actually what you are doing? their POLITICAL strategies in print? I don't think so?] in the print marketplace, though preceding work is often organized along genre lines. For example, George Taylor, in *The French Revolution and the London Stage*, sets forth some key contentions about literature’s cultural capital[ if this is what you mean by political it will need unpacking]. He argues that although eighteenth-century critics sought to make distinctions in the social value of different plays, or different parts of the theatrical program at a single show, audiences did not make these distinctions. “Although audiences were divided according to class between pit, box and gallery,” he argues, the division was purely physical: “all came to see the same shows, for within one programme there was a variety that not only satisfied the different groups but satisfied them all \[...\] all received plaudits from all corners of the house” \\cite\{Taylor:2001gp p.3\}. Taylor proceeds to define the central concerns and strategies of the plays staged during this period, arguing that “the determining feature of the period for the theatre was the sense of loss, a feeling that things had changed in ways that people did not expect or want,” a feeling that was reflected in “images of incarceration, dislocation and supernatural intervention” \\cite\{Taylor:2001gp p.221\}. This analysis of the theatre is structured by his originating observation that “Disagreement as to what is trash and what is treasure suggests cultural crisis, when values are put under question by social stress or political conflict” [ so maybe you could start with this, but also - to what extent is the trash/treasure thing produced in the 1790s, vs produced by scholars looking back at 1790s? Just keep that question in mind]\\cite\{Taylor:2001gp p.3\}. The communal space of the theatre, which some cultural critics in the eighteenth century attempt to render non-communal and to dissect along class lines, is for Taylor fertile ground. For my inquiry, it is the “\[d\]isagreement as to what is trash and what it treasure” itself which animates me: the terms “trash” and “treasure” are hardly exaggerations of the extremity of the conflicting assessments which could be passed regarding the same works[ add a paragraph about the rise of the novel after this one, later on



The unexpected difficulty of distinguishing “trash” and “treasure” is also a throughline in the many competing histories of the rise of the novel, and in particular their need to address the Gothic novel’s astonishing popularity.].



##### 1.1.2.2.6.  freewrite #####



The intersection of eighteenth century studies and queer theory, in the Venn diagram of scholarly motivations behind this work[ i do think, drop the Venn], is filled with the Gothic. The implicit, foundational importance of the Gothic to this work is difficult to narrativize into a cause and effect. Do I apply the frameworks of queer theory because it is well-suited to Gothic subject matter? Or does the Gothic offer itself for study because I have brought to bear the lenses of queer theory? Do I turn my attention to the 1790s because of an interest in the Gothic? Or does the Gothic capture my attention because it is necessary to making sense of the 1790s?[ you don't need this paragraph methinks] 

These difficulties play out in differing histories of the field of Gothic studies. Those who work on the queer gothic have no trouble identifying, as the catalyst for a reconsideration of the Gothic itself, Eve Sedgwick’s 1985 monograph, *Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire*. Sedgwick often goes hand-in-hand with George Haggerty’s 1986 article “Literature and Homosexuality in the Late Eighteenth Century: Walpole, Beckford, and Lewis,” which examined the same authors. But those who examine the Female Gothic, employing feminist rather than queer critique, see earlier origins in Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s *Madwoman in the Attic* (1979) and Juliann Fleenor’s *The Female Gothic* (1983). And many discussions of the Gothic-*qua*-Gothic skip directly from Montague Summers’ 1938 *The Gothic Quest* to David Punter’s 1996 *The Literature of Terror*, more than a decade after Sedgwick. How can Gothic studies disagree with such a large variance in dates?[ this sentence needs rephrasing] The seventeen-year gulf between 1979 and 1996 encompasses nearly all of \[the theory wars\]. The Summers-to-Punter historiography is generally invested in a rhetorical move by which Summers’ work is dismissed as sloppy, unscholarly, motivated by mere enthusiasm (though usefully obsessive), such that Punter emerges in contrast as the first examination of the Gothic to be serious. Of course, implicit in this rhetorical move is the idea that feminist and queer scholarship on the Gothic is also unserious, perhaps contaminated by personal enthusiasm[ this section is very confusing for a non Gothic specialist to follow.].

Punter himself \[does something useful\] in ‘legitimizing’ the Gothic. \[One to two sentences on his intervention.\] But of greater importance to me is the perhaps-dangerous transhistoricist work of feminist and queer gothic studies.



One difficulty presented by the specifically Gothic facets of queer theory is the role of paranoia. Sedgwick proposes that it is the paranoia of the Gothic which makes it so evocatively queer. But of course, one of my desires is to resist paranoia.

\[Something about Susan Sontag & camp being how I reparatively read the Gothic?\]

 

This dissertation does not seek to explicitly define, taxonomize, or study the Gothic, largely because I join in recent work like Robert Miles’ which sees the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which may appear across the literary mediascape[ you will need to unpack this]. Because I wish to better understand the Gothic, I do not take the Gothic as my direct subject, but turn my attention to an area where I believe it will emerge. I wish to know, for different macroanlytical views of the decade, whether, and how, the Gothic does in fact appear.

\[A lot of queer Gothic work has been paranoid\] \[Something about Susan Sontag & camp being how I reparatively read the Gothic?\]

Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s often-quoted assertion that “\[t\]he Gothic novel crystallized for English audiences the terms of a dialectic between homosexuality and homophobia, in which homophobia appeared thematically in paranoid plots” (92)” (p 272)

“ Locating the rise of that paranoid plot within the narratives of three Gothic novelists who were each “in some significant sense homosexual -- Beckford notoriously, Lewis probably, Walpole iffily” (92), Sedgwick’s Between Men itself crystallizes a critical tradition that stretches back at least as far as Montague Summers’s reading of Matthew Lewis in The Gothic Quest (1938) and that inflects every sustained discussion of homosexuality and the Gothic (at least the male Gothic) of the past three decades.” (272)



###### 1.1.2.2.7.1.  dichotomy ######



Current scholarship is increasingly attentive to the strategies employed by the *winners* of this dichotomy between valuable ‘literature’ and worthless, even dangerous, ‘popular fictions.’ Rather than discussing the failings of those works which \[don’t do ‘high literature’\], work like Michael Gamer’s draws our attention to \[the rhetorical techniques by which ‘high literature’ define themselves in opposition to the ‘low’\]



###### 1.1.2.2.7.2.  supernatural & canons ######



Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the other ‘big six’ Romantics are surely the winners of the eighteenth century historical battle for cultural capital; just as surely, the loser has been the Gothic. E.J. Clery’s *The Rise of Supernatural Fiction, 1762-1800* provides an account of what was at stake for the representations of supernatural events in supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news \\cite\{Clery:HFvEup7z\}. The “rise” she describes is not an increase in volume and prominence of supernatural stories, since her starting point in 1762 (the Cock Lane ghost) is a major national phenomenon with many imitators. Rather, supernatural fiction ‘rises’ when it acquires cultural legitimacy. Michael Gamer has more recently expanded on how this ‘rise’ fuelled Romanticism’s own rise \\cite\{Gamer:jX8nTxB-\}. In *Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation*, he details  the interconnectednesss of what are now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Gamer argues, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste without risking the loss of cultural capital which attended the Gothic’s “popularity”. Gamer, like Guillory, primarily examines Wordsworth and the ‘winners’ of the struggle for cultural capital: I, like Clery, am more interested in the ‘losers.’ Accordingly, I attend to much that is *not* literature, in order to better understand why it is not[ you might want to consider the new formalist work to reclaim the literary qua the literary - and e.g. Steve Conner's - "nah" to that. Probably meamns a few weeks of extra reading tho.].  

Queer readings of the literature of the 1790s --- which is to say, of the Gothic[ but the 1790s produce other things than the Gothic....] (since queer theory is rarely applied to the other genres of the period) --- provide an invigorating way to value some of the most vibrant writing of the decade precisely for the features which rendered it less than “respectable.” \[A lot of really good Gothic work is connected thematically rather than strictly chronologically, examining the “transtemporal affinities and connections” (CITE) that Felski argues are often shut out by contemporary historicist critique. And indeed, historicist critique is causing this mode of study to fall out of favour regarding the Female Gothic. Nonetheless, there is a rich history of transtemporal work on the Female Gothic. \[I DON’T NECESSARILY BUY THIS STUFF BUT IT HAD IMPORTANT GOALS\]\]  

Although the queerest work in this period has centred on the Gothic, I intentionally do not limit my focus to the Gothic. My broader scope is, in part, based in an argument about the Gothic’s prevalence: following scholars like \[EXAMPLE - prob Miles?\], I see the Gothic not as a clearly-defined literary genre, but rather as an affective ‘mode’ that can (and did) permeate writing far beyond the realm of supernatural fiction. Accordingly, \[although I am interested in the Gothic, I study everything.\] \[Also I’m not just interested in the Gothic.\]



#### 1.1.2.3.  queer & DH ####  

My emphasis on transparent, critical, and reflective praxis in the capture and visual presentation of data[^cf24] owes much to the emerging field of critical algorithm studies. Any methodology is, to a certain extent, an “algorithm,” in the loose definition of ‘a series of pre-defined steps to be carried out’. But computational algorithms differ from “algorithms” implemented by humans. Computational algorithms have two key vulnerabilities: first, their operations are less easily scrutinized; second, their results are more easily trusted. The second vulnerability --- the cultural aura of empirical trustworthiness which accrues to anything ‘computational’ --- is another flavour of the same vulnerability that Drucker describes with ‘data’ generally. Because the human agents who designed and trained any given algorithm appear to be absent from its operation, the algorithm appears able to discover truth directly. This is how Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra was able to tweet with disdain that “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) claims that algorithms, which are driven by math, are racist” \\cite\{Saavedra:2019wr\}: anything “driven by math,” he assumes, must be incapable of human fallibilities like racism. But as Safiya Noble shows extensively in *Algorithms of Oppression*, algorithms by default reproduce, and can easily exaggerate, the assumptions and biases of the culture in which they are made \\cite\{Noble:2018wo\}. In other words, in a racist world, algorithms *are* racist --- and sexist, and duplicative of all other systemic inequities.

Wendy Chun suggests that the problem with much algorithmic inquiry lies in its most core assumption: the insistence that the future must look like the past \\cite\{Chun:2018tq\}. This assumption is essential to any system which exclusively bases its predictions on past data. It is particularly intertwined with what Chun calls “homophily,” “the axiom that similarity breeds connection---which grounds contemporary network science” \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.60\}. Homophily, as it is currently applied to network science, Chun argues, both “assumes and creates segregation” \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.76\} in a fashion that allows it to operate “like money laundering for bias” \\cite\{Chun:2018tq pp.62-63\}. Importantly, however, the analogy to money laundering is imperfect: it cannot be resolved with “better, cleaner data” \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.64\}. Instead, Chun insists, “new theories of connection---which do not presume a dangerously banal and reciprocal notion of friendship---are needed” \\cite\{Chun:2018tq p.89\}, a call to action which places its emphasis not on the information provided to an algorithm but on the algorithm’s procedures.  

As Chun’s punning title, “Queerying Homophily” suggests, she, like many scholars, turns to queer theory as a way to address the structural failings of algorithms. “Queer DH” is a vibrant field in its own right, with many distinct but interwoven threads. Some work, like Chun’s, take the theoretical underpinnings of contemporary computational practices as their primary object of study, and conceptualize queerer theoretical approaches. Others similarly undertake non-computational research to examine computational subjects queerly, as in Bonnie Ruberg’s *Video Games Have Always Been Queer*. Many projects apply existing computational methods to queer literatures and histories. Often, these approaches coincide, as queer subjects demand queerer methods[ Need to add an example here. Also need to expand in more detail on all of these examples.], as in T.L. Cowan’s *Cabaret Commons*. I draw inspiration from work from across this spectrum of queer DH in my pursuit of less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive digital humanities methodologies.  

\[I’ve mentioned a lot of critical work; I want to be post-critical and reparative.\] As I encounter the limitations of the various information and tools through which I attempt to understand the 1790s, my goal is to do something other than facilely observe that they are limited. Instead, I want to identify the best ways to continue building on their foundations. In a digital humanities context, a focus on building connections can be mundanely practical: typing indexes from print works into spreadsheets, correcting errors within datasets, writing programs to process metadata: all of these maintain the functional usability of existing resources in new contexts. When this kind of extended, detail-oriented labour is combined with serious reflection on the histories and possible futures of these resources, I contend, they bring us to new knowledge. In this, maintaining and using digital resources is also a way to repair them --- and to produce reparative readings of their contents.  

Thus far, the importance of reparative work to DH is evident. But what about the other direction? Just as, I argue, both DH and bibliography have important resources to offer to each other, so to do I argue that DH has something to offer to reparative reading. Specifically, a well-formulated DH praxis can introduce a new relationship to the experience of *surprise* which is so challenging in paranoid reading. The most common dismissals of DH research are attempts to say, “we already knew that” --- essentially, \[PARANOID AVOIDANCE OF UNPLEASANT SURPRISE FROM DH COMING FOR THEIR JOBS\]. This reaction invites two responses. First, \[if the experiment told us that everything we knew was COMPLETELY WRONG, this would not be very good because probably at least some of what we know is right; an experiment should validate some of our existing knowledge\]. \[Experiments fall into two categories: those which tell us about our methods, and those which tell us about our fields of study\]. Second, as scholars such as Ted Underwood have noted, it is often only *retroactively* that these discoveries are declared to be “obvious” results which everyone “already knew” (CITE). If we are asked to form an explicit hypothesis in advance, we might be very surprised by the exact numbers. \[TRANSITION\] Rather than being an awkward fit for my theoretical aims, and rather than pursuing reparative reading in spite of my computational methods, I see the laborious, intimate process of experimental computation as a directly valuable source[ I like this page, but there's a bit of work to do to clarify how all this is going to inform the thesis]  

if you are forced to manually encode assumptions into real code you have to confront them - if you do computation reflectively, you neither conquer your material nor claim an algorithmic grasp of objective truth: if you do not account for the variety - your code does not work - if you talk about it -where is it that my system encountered resistance....



“Inspecting and hand-counting individual records has the advantage of allowing the bibliographer to make careful discriminations, even as it introduces a degree of subjectivity (to say nothing of human error) and, hence, guarantees the irreproducibility of exact results.” (Suarex 42)

“**sets of protocols for each of these categories were / developed and strictly adhered to” (Suarez 44-5)**

**“the results of this study are repeatable, but not exactly so**.” (Suarez 45)



### 1.1.3.  upcoming 2 experiments ###  

Having described a large and complex scholarly context for this work, and made some preliminary efforts toward synthesis of these disparate backgrounds, it is time, now, to describe my own project in more detail. This dissertation has two major parts. The first examines the literature of the 1790s through the lens of ‘titles,’ and the second through ‘persons.’ In both cases my central interest is the vexed category of ‘popularity.’ With both ‘titles’ and ‘persons’, I establish the materials with which I will be working and their implicit models. Using the information they make most readily accessible, I explore which works and individuals emerge as ‘popular’ or ‘important’ in each resource[ which resource. something missing here]. I also probe each resource for its representation of (or failure to represent) my touchstone authors, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson[ all this is too new to the reader to be handled so fast -which resources, why these touchstone authors, how is all of this related to what we just read about your scholarly background]. The resulting findings are primarily used to evaluate how the underlying digital resources participate in or resist the projects of canon-building[ you have buried the lead - this is the lead]. Then, for both titles and persons, there is a ‘turn.’ For each area of inquiry I introduce a novel experiment which synthesizes my materials and repurposes them. These experiments are then used to draw conclusions about 1790s print culture.



#### 1.1.3.1.  titles ####



The first phase of this project takes up titles and databases. Throughout this work, a ‘title’ is the broadest possible umbrella term for a text: it is synonymous with ‘a database entry which I believe to represent a printed work.’ Each individual database will shape the precise correspondences between a ‘title’ and the printed texts about which I use ‘titles’ to reason. For example, it will vary based on my source whether multiple editions of the same work are several ‘titles’ or one ‘title,’ and whether the titles exclusively represent ‘books’ or also include chapbooks, broadsheets, or even ephemera. Due to the inscrutability of much digital infrastructure, a problem discussed above, it is often not possible for me to know prior to experimentation what kinds of titles I am working with. Chapter two, therefore, two takes up the topic in the form of contemporary digital archives directly; I examine corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized.  

In chapter two, I make the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begin the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s). I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I research the history of how each corpus was formed. As part of this process, I also discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity.  The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.  

In chapter three, I synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, to examine questions about the popularity of texts in 1790s print culture. I begin by creating my own ‘superset’ database of all records. I then query this database through random sampling and topic modelling. Both random sampling and topic modelling, as methodologies, allow me to examine information outside of its pre-designed data structures. Random sampling, which Steven Zwicker \\cite\{Zwicker:2006ck\} and Leo Lahti, Niko Ilomäki, and Mikko Tolonen \\cite\{Lahti:2015dd\} have applied successfully to the English Short Title Catalogue’s holdings, makes it feasible to apply a greater level of human scrutiny to a large body of texts. Topic modelling makes it feasible regularize otherwise-disparate materials without imposing a pre-defined ontology[ terms needing definition - topic modelling, random sampling, ontology]. My use of topic modelling differs somewhat from its typical use in literary distant reading, which generally applies topic models to the full text of literary works, and examines topics themselves as proxies for subtle elements of textual content. I model only the titles of works, taking advantage of the eighteenth century’s distinctively rich title conventions.[^cf25] Both of these methods allow me to use my ‘superset’ database to ask questions about 1790s literature itself. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I consider popularity in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share. After presenting my proposals for how to calculate each of these metrics, I ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? Many of the most reprinted works substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature.”



## 1.2.  ch 2 - archives ##  

Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.  

A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer & Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.”



Blayney believes that Lesser & Farmer attempt to disprove his “one inescapable fact about printed plays---namely, that they were not the best-selling moneyspinners that so many commentators have evidently believed they should have been” (7). But what really matters to him about identifying the “best-selling moneyspinners” of the day is not the ‘moneyspinning’ --- the question of whether, when a publisher bought a play, he was making a sound financial decision --- but about the cultural centrality of ‘bestsellers’. The total market share of religious texts matters, not because it meant that publishers turned their highest profits off of religious texts, but because “\[c\]ustomers in early modern bookshops chose to spend far more of their money on religious books than they did on playbooks and other ‘literary’ publications,” evidence of “just how massively important godly books were to early modern readers” (7). Lesser and Farmer do not contradict the importance of religious texts to readers. But, in setting out “not merely to measure comparative popularity but also to explain why and how different kinds of books were published.” (F&L 213), they make the case that books with low market share, books that are not “best-selling,” could nonetheless be “moneyspinners.” Their rebuttal states that “...books could be in high demand even though their reprint rate was low. Likewise, books (such as ballads) could be in high demand even though their profitability per copy was low. And, as seems to have been the case with plays, books could be in high demand even though their market share was low” (F&L 213), but what they leave somewhat unstated is: “in high demand” *with whom*?



My own work seeks to examine reprints, but in a more limited fashion than Farmer & Lesser were able to do. Rather than determine the reprint rate of various kinds of fiction, I carry out a Blayney-style examination of pure market share. I seek to identify reprints in order to determine the market share of new versus reprinted material in any given year.   

1. **(Reprinting)** Simon Bainbridge: best-selling, most-reprinted, most-adapted
2. **(Assertion)** George Taylor: simply asserts that some things are popular
3. **(Assertion)** Peter Murphy: despite promising that his study “examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history,” Murphy says NOTHING AT ALL about how well, to whom, for how much, etc etc things were sold.
4. **(Performances)** Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, et al.: number of performances per play (*Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory*)
5. **(Book history)** Cronin: mostly asserts that people are “popular” or “celebrated”; with Erasmus Darwin, supports this by saying that the book The Botanic Garden is beautiful & expensive
6. **(Editions, reprints, market share, profitability)** Lesser & Farmer, Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade **-** “we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)
7. **(Market share)** Blayney
8. **(Title counts)** MacLeod on the Minerva press --- evaluates most popular authors & subgenres based on the number of “works published” or “titles” (unclear if this includes reprints)
9. **(Reprints, anthologizing, “influence”)** p 193: assessing Smith’s importance based on page counts anthologized in 1833 Specimens of English Sonnets and Specimens of British Poetesses. “it is clear from sonnets like Bowles’s, Coleridge’s, Wordsworth’s, Opie’s, Hanson’s, Dark’s, Keats’s, and even Anna Seward’s that her influence was wide, formative, and powerful, just as it was in prose fiction for novelists like Austen, Radcliffe, Opie, Scott and others. Judith Stanton undoubtedly exaggerates matters, therefore, when she observes sadly of Smith that ‘already waning in her later years, the popularity of her works ended with her death,’ for, as noted earlier, her poetry continued to be reprinted through mid-century (including in Frederic Rowton’s notorious 1848 Female Poets of Great Britain)” (Behrendt 201).
10. **(Reprints, “emulation”)** “During her lifetime Charlotte Smith was a literary celebrity: her Elegiac Sonnets and Other Poems (1784) were continuously reprinted and wifely emulated.” (Duckling 203)
  

It is not, in fact, possible to calculate 



Without \[certain kinds of evidence\], as F&L note, “we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books... if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists” (F&L 16)

Would need size of print runs and cost to produce, as well as sale price, and quantity sold.

\[So it’s a little nonsense when people just say that something is popular\]  

The full scope of my project is to grapple with every online database which contains at least 100 texts meeting my criteria: printed, in England, between the years 1789-99. 

I exclude databases of diaries or correspondence, since they are not *printed*. This has the effect of excluding single-author databases.  

I make an exception for archives which specifically seek to address gaps in archival holdings due to systemic bias, that is, three archives focused on women’s writing: Orlando, Chawton, and \[I thought there was a third one\].

For the most part archives are either comprehensive and have significantly more than 100 texts, or they are single-author / single-researcher focused, and thus have significantly less than 100. These kinds of reparative projects occupy the middle space.

The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)



What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.

A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.

Another approach is to ignore the categories and use things like topic modelling; relies on a more intimate knowledge of the information being studies (i.e., humanities expertise)  

These basic factual questions, about what is in the various eighteenth century digital corpora that represent “mass” 18thC holdings for scholars, matter because \[\]. Even though the specific numbers are likely to change as these digital holdings are continuously updated, my investigation of an archive “snapshot” matters because \[they show how questions of fact can (and cannot) be answered?\]  

Google Books prioritizes low-quality information over *no* information. The algorithmic extraction of publication dates from title pages, for example, can never be perfect. But algorithms give their predictions with certainty estimates: if accuracy was a higher priority, Google Books could calibrate the algorithm to simply provide no answer when none of the possibilities cross a given certainty threshold.



Per <http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1701> , they actually OVERWRITE metadata provided by partners with their algorithmic information!! They could very easily *not*.  

The history of the English Short-Title Catalog is long, as befits its enormous scope. “The English Short-Title Catalog (ESTC) is a vast database designed to include a bibliographic record, with holdings, of every surviving copy of letterpress produced in Great Britain or any of its dependencies, in any language, worldwide, from 1473-1800” (CBSR)[ not sure how best to cite this - <http://estc.ucr.edu/index.html#>]. Today, “The English Short-Title Catalogue is the most comprehensive record of what has appeared in print in Britain and the English-speaking world for all branches of human experience from the last quarter of the fifteenth century to the start of the nineteenth. More specialized studies exist for fields and eras within that span, but no other resource matches ESTC’s dependability over such a broad range” (Vander Meulen 265).

It began as the Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue in the 1970s, operating in a similar line as the original Pollard and Redgrave Short-Title Catalogue for 1476--1640, which first appeared in 1926, and Donald Wing’s catalogue for 1641--1700, which appeared in 1951. These catalogues established the ambitious simplicity of the ESTC: to accurately describe every edition of every printed work in English or from the United Kingdom. After the completion of Wing’s STC, “\[e\]xploratory studies, poorly funded and inadequate though they were” (Korshin 209) throughout the 1950s and 60s pursued the feasibility of systematically accounting for the much larger body of printed work produced in the eighteenth century. The Eighteenth Century Short Title Catalogue began properly in 1976, at a conference jointly sponsored by the British Library and the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies (Crump 106). Here, “bibliographers and librarians attempted both to arrive at a consensus of the size of the task and the methodology that would have to be adopted to achieve a union catalogue. However, until the works were catalogued, it would not be possible to answer basic questions (such as the potential number of extant items) which would predetermine working methods. The very fact that they found it difficult to agree for want of sound and accepted figures indicated the need for ESTC.” (Crump 105). A pilot project began at the British Library in 1977, under the direction of Robin Alston (Crump 105).

Unlike earlier Short-Title Catalogues, which appeared as lengthly print publication, the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue was conceived as digital from the beginning --- a decision which, as Karian notes, “exhibited considerable foresight” (283) in the 1970s. As a result, “ESTC records existed in digital form long before many humanists saw computer technology as central to their work” (Karian 283).  Robin Alston and Mervyn Jannetta developed their own cataloguing rules, distinct from the Library of Congress MARC and UK MARC standards (Korshin 211). Once these standards were established, the British Library began to re-catalogue its own holdings, and in 1979 libraries in the United States, Germany, and Australia undertook to supplement them. In these international collaborations, “Where ESTC records already existed, these were adopted as the \[new\] record and only those works not held in the ESTC base file were catalogued again” (Crump 105). “One implication of the publication history of short-title catalogues is that they have been deemed functional and valuable even before they were complete. (That estimation is crucial, for their full completion is for all practical purposes impossible.) Judging that even a preliminary form of the records was useful to scholars, the planners of ESTC determined to conduct its development “in full public view” and to make the incomplete file available “warts and all” (in the words of Henry Snyder and Michael Crump, responding to criticism by Peter Blayney)” (Vander Meulen 270). Accordingly, the in-progress database “was soon available online, from 1980 via the British Library BLAISE \[British LibraryAutomated Information SErvice\] system and from 1981 in the US Research Libraries Group RLIN \[Research Libraries Information Network\] system” (Norman). Each of these databases was worked on locally by researchers, and then updated and reconciled with each other weekly.

To supplement these databases, accessible almost exclusively to librarians with specialized training in operating them and primarily used by the scholars compiling the file, the ESTC intended to publish editions at particular milestones of completeness, intended for the use of non-librarian scholars. Their “first step, a fiche catalogue of \[the British Library’s\] holdings, together with indexes, generated by the computer” (Crump 105) was published in a microform “snapshot” in 1983, but other milestones did not occur according to schedule. The “joint Anglo-American interim publication of the ESTC file ” (Korshin 212) which was expected to follow on microform in 1984 (Korshin 212) did not appear. Alston attributed the delays partly to the immensity of the task, and partly to the impact of short-term cost-cutting decisions, like the reduction of proofreading in early stages or of in-person examination of books, which dramatically increased the labour of verifying the resulting database record. Although he consistently warned “how easily strategic decisions based exclusively on cost usually lead to greater, not less, eventual costs” (Alston), the ESTC each year seemed to be facing a new budget struggle, and important maintenance labour was several times deferred. This created something like a paradox for the ESTC: funding bodies wanted to commit less money to a project which was behind schedule, but the project would remain behind schedule unless it was funded to complete the work required. 

Nonetheless, work continued, and in 1985, the online databases in RLIN and BLAISE were upgraded to allow dynamic updates to a single shared file (Crump 106), which for the first time allowed continuous access to a shared record, rather than the constant exchange and messy merging of individual partially-overlapping records. “Until the file was dynamically available online on RLIN in 1985 batch processing was a weekly nightmare” (Alston). At this time, it was hoped that the new RLIN file would “result in a more complete and coherent ’first edition’ of ESTC” to be published in 1989 (Crump 106), though this deadline, too, was not met. In the mean time “the ESTC file \[was\] available to scholars on both BLAISE-LINE and on RLIN.” (Crump 106). To facilitate its use, the ESTC distributed “\[a\] simplified manual for searching the file on-line” (Crump 106). Crump took the opportunity of the update to rhapsodize on the database’s potential usefulness for other scholars: “No longer is the scholar limited in access to the data by the fixity of the printed page” (106). This valuable resource was not without cost. Although the manual on how to formulate search queries was free, use of the ESTC itself was notably not. Institutions or individuals paid to subscribe to the ESTC itself, paid per query for searches to be run, paid per minute for being connected to the database, and often paid for access to the computers they must use in their own libraries. Tabor says “the ongoing expense of consulting ESTC was the cyber-equivalent of the hefty up-front payment needed to acquire its printed predecessors, STC and Wing” (367).

“In 1987, with the agreement of the Bibliographical Society and the Modern Language Association of America, the International Committee approved the extension of the database to cover the period from the beginning of printing in the British Isles (ca. 1472) to 1700. The file changed its name to the 'English Short Title Catalogue', thereby keeping its well-known acronym. The USA team began cataloguing pre-1701 material in 1989, joined in the mid-1990s by the British Library team, and the resulting records were made available in the RLIN file from 1994.” (Norman). “In 1992, IESTC approved a further extension of the file to include serial publications. The USA team began work in 1994 on the cataloguing of serials within the scope of ESTC” (Norman). 

Concurrently with the development of the ESTC, Wing’s seventeenth-century STC was undergoing redevelopment into a second edition, overseen by Katharine Pantzer. The second edition of Wing’s STC was published in two volumes in 1976 and 1986, followed by a set of exhaustive indexes in 1991. This second edition “represented a vast development of the original” (Vander Meulen 268), incorporating thousands of new entries, expanding the titles, and adding explanatory notes and headnotes. Its completion in 1991 also marked the end of the ability of its publisher and sponsor, the Bibliographical Society, to support it (Vander Meulen 269). “Accordingly, in 1999 the Society made an agreement with ESTC whereby the latter... would assume official responsibility for receiving new STC data” (Vander Meulen 270). The ESTC continued to research new entries and improve existing ones, releasing a second edition of the file on CD-ROM in 1998 and a third edition in 2003 (Norman).

In 2006, almost thirty years after the commencement of the project, the ESTC underwent another major shift: the database was made publicly available to be searched for free online. This inspired more rhapsodizing, this time from Tabor: “The freeing of ESTC ... now places in one location, for the consultation of anyone with internet access, the fullest and most up-to-date bibliographical account of ‘English’ printing” (367). At the same time, the ESTC began a project “to provide full title and imprint transcriptions for the eighteenth-century records” (Tabor 370). Vander Meulen says that “The history of ESTC is in fact the record of steady developments. Some have been conspicuous---for instance, the physical progression from a printed prototype to microfiche, CD, online access via the vendors Blaise Line and RLIN, and universal online availability through the British Library.” (Vander Meulen 270) Many more have been less visible, in constant improvements to the accuracy and detail of the records. In 2011, the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research at the University of California Riverside was awarded a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to “redesign the ESTC as a 21st century research tool” (“Planning Grant”)[ add to bibliography], which was followed in 2013 by a larger two-year grant to execute software improvements to the ESTC.  





  

“ESTC’s most basic bibliographical function is to provide, for each edition, a description of the ideal copy, meaning the most complete and correct manifestation of that edition as the printer and publisher intended it” (Tabor 369).



“The Project staff found that many eighteenth-century books in hundreds of libraries around the world have never been / catalogued at all, or are described in a group heading,” especially for single-sheet items (Korshin 210-211). “Panizzis ‘Rules' lead to confusing entries and filing for anonymous entries or for items with corporate authorship. For these, and many other related reasons, Alston and Jannetta decided to write their own cataloguing rules, allowing their entries eventually to be converted into machine-readable form, but differing slightly from the standards for machine-readable cataloguing devised in this country (Library of Congress MARC) and in the United Kingdom (UK MARC). Modern machine-readable cataloguing has been devised to deal with cataloguing new books and serials; the ESTC's cataloguing rules have been devised in such a way that a scholar anywhere in the world can tell, from the ESTC entry, whether the copy of the book inhis or her library is the same or different from the one listed in ESTC.” (Korshin 211)



“Because the ESTC was formed from three different projects over many decades, the existence of subject headings varies. For books that are from the periods 1475-1640 (from the original Short-Title Catalogue created by Pollard and Redgrave) and 1641-1700 (from Donald Wing’s short-title catalogue), subject headings exist. But subject headings were not initially created for the eighteenth-century records in the ESTC, and so subject headings rarely occur for the items in ECCO.” (Karian, “Guide” 3)



An Edition:

“Because ESTC is a bibliographical database rather than a catalogue, strictly speaking, its records describe groups of copies,” such as editions, “rather than specific copies,” such as the Exeter Book (Tabor 369). The ESTC sometimes has separate entries for groups within an edition “when certain separately planned marketing units can be identified within the edition, such as reissues, imprint variants, and large versus regular-paper copies” (Tabor 369). Or, in “the later eighteenth century, when reprints from standing type became more common, ESTC cataloguers have occasionally granularized down to the level of individual impressions” (Tabor 369). Tabor and I both deem the term “edition” a sufficient umbrella term “\[f\]or the purpose of this discussion” (Tabor 369).

“The first problem relates to the unit of classification. A clearly defined unit is necessary to ensure that a study of change over time is reliable and based on consistent terms. What is the unit that the ESTC uses? Scholars sometimes answer by using the terms “edition,” “issue,” or “title” interchangeably. But since the ESTC does not rely in a consistent manner on any of these terms for its unit of classification, one should refer instead only to the ESTC record, a unit created by the ESTC and having no meaning outside the ESTC.” (Karian 289)

“For the most part, the ESTC contains a record for each issue” (Karian 289) “Sometimes the ESTC contains additional records if there are multiple *states* of an edition (a different state results from cancels or minor changes to the setting of type).” (Karian 289)



An Ideal Copy:

“As additional reports of copies arrive, it may be that the ideal description must change in response. For instance, the existence of a half-title may only emerge on the evidence of the seventh copy reported. A half-title would then be added to the description of the ideal copy, and the six previously matched physical copies will receive notes recording that they are imperfect in this respect” (Tabor 370).

“In ESTC the matching process hinges on five points of identity: the title, as far as it is given by ESTC; the edition statement; the imprint, again as far as it is given by ESTC; the pagination; and the format” (Tabor 370).  

Using the database:

“the needs of the specialist audience that has formed ESTC’s main constituency in the past and may reasonably be expected to continue as such: the explorers in the field who need detailed maps. In my task of mediating between the file and its users, I find that these people approach early books with questions regarding one or both of two broad topics: intellectual content and physical characteristics, the latter including the location of copies,” with most interested in “the physicality of books.” (Tabor 369)

“When everything is working right, as it does in ESTC more often than not, the bibliographical description is completely accurate as far as it attempts to go, and variations in the matched copies can be reliably determined by the presence or absence of copy-specific notes. If anything happens to disturb the links between the description and its attached holdings, including errors committed in the course of creating the description, the record gets broken and starts telling lies about physical copies or, worse, about the ideal copy” (Tabor 370)



“the ESTC is one of the best resources to identify relevant printed materials, determine their publishing histories, and find out where they can be examined” (Karian 283)  

The ESTC is not actually only one database: “The STAR file[ is this still true?], maintained at the ESTC editorial office in Riverside, California, has been functioning for years as a repository for revisions that are transmitted in periodic updates to the publicly accessible file. ... In consequence, though invisible and inaccessible to most of ESTC’s users, STAR contains the most up-to-date version of the file.” (Tabor 373) There are two kinds of information, in particular, which the STAR file contains and which is concealed from ESTC users: the true ‘verified’ status of individual edition matches, and edition-specific notes on known errors.

A “match” in the ESTC is a known copy of a book held in a library which serves as a representative of a particular edition. A match can be encoded as “verified” when an ESTC staff member consults the book to confirm that it corresponds to the edition in question, or “unverified” when this has not happened. But the STAR copy contains two additional verification statuses: when a contributor such as a librarian or a scholar submits a match, it is coded as a “web match.” “Because most outside contributors have received no training in the matching process from ESTC, it would be fair to say that these matches occupy a level of certainty somewhere between the ‘verified’ and ‘unverified’ levels” (Tabor 374). Automated uploads of various outside databases can also generate new matches, encoded as “catalogue matches;” these “have a comparatively low level of reliability” (Tabor 374). However, in the transition from STAR to ESTC, “The standard holdings display smoothes over these nuances; here both catalogue and web matches are translated to ‘verified’. This forces the file to make categorical statements of certainty even in obvious cases of considerable doubt” (374).

Transcription errors



Broken records

“A broken record occurs when information added to a record has not been checked against the copies already listed under that record” (Karian 285)



Inaccurate dates

‘The ESTC sometimes records the date as questionable, and sometimes records the date within a range. But when one does a large-scale search for records---for example, everything from 1720---there is no easy way to screen out items not definitively dated to 1720” (Karian 291)



“only records bibliographic information about surviving books ... After a careful study of book advertisements, inventories and bibliographies, it seems to this investigator that, excluding jobbing and newspaper printing, as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701--1800 has not been incorporated into the ESTC.11 In other words, for up to 10 per cent of the editions printed in the eighteenth century, not a single copy is known to survive.” (Suarez 40)  

My own sliver of the ESTC was generously provided to me by the British Library in January 2017. It contains all items matching the query I specified, “(Words= alldocuments and W-year= 1789-\>1799 and W-Country of publica= enk),” which requests all documents published between 1789 and 1799 (inclusive) with a place of publication encoded as “England.” Running this search on the ESTC website at the time returned 52,001 records. The tools used to create the file, according to the librarian with whom I corresponded, returned 51,965 records, 36 records having gone missing; however, the file itself contains only 51,860, another 105 mysteriously lost. These 141 missing records are currently an unsolved mystery. My records come from the British Library’s ESTC database, rather than the STAR file. The corpus itself consists of a csv file[^cf26] with fifteen columns of information. The columns are: “Type of resource” (“Monograph” or “Serial”); “ESTC citation number”; “Name” (e.g., of an author, editor or illustrator); “Dates associated with name” (generally, the years they lived); “Type of name” (“meeting/conference,” “organization,” or “person”); “Role” (e.g., “author,” “cartographer,” or “bookseller”), “All names”, “Title”, “Variant titles”, “Place of publication”, “Publisher”, “Date of publication” (a single year), “Date of publication (not standardised)” (e.g., a year in roman numerals, or a date which includes a month or day), and “Publication date range” (for serials). In other words, it includes the very basic information of author, title, publisher, and year, in a complex structure which belies the apparent simplicity of these “basics.” Some of the ESTC records included in this corpus do not necessarily match my selection criteria (England, 1789-99), which is inevitably true of every corpus collected, and which I discuss in more detail in SECTION, Data Cleaning.  

“To use a metaphor, some people prefer to explore the world through books of photographs with occasional schematic maps. ESTC, on the other hand, provides the equivalent of a detailed topographic map, but no pictures. Such technical tools have limited appeal, even to some specialists; but if you want to thoroughly learn the lie of the land, you will need one, and the more complete and accurate the better.” (Tabor)



  

“An increasingly common trend, I am sorry to report, is that more and more people do not want ESTC at all --- they want ECCO or EEBO. The younger generation of scholars in particular, lured by full-text images and ransacking the Web for illustrations for their books and articles, are using these utilities as de facto bibliographic databases. They find that the stripped-down records and simplified indexes are good enough for their purposes. To a minority of them, the fact that other works, editions, and copies exist outside the Web is irrelevant, and perhaps even irritating.” (Tabor 368)  

The collection seems to be less well-maintained now that the main creation activity has subsided. (RESEARCH: since Gale acquired ECCO?) The official TCP website provides links to many places where ECCO-TCP materials are said to be available, but most of these links are dead; Stephen H. Gregg’s unofficial blog post “Finding ECCO-TCP texts” is a much better guide to using these materials.  

“In partnership with Microsoft, the British Library has digitised, and made freely available under Public Domain Mark, over 60,000 volumes (around 25 million pages) of out of copyright 18th & 19th century texts.”  

Also in the category of smaller and specialized archives is Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg makes no claims to scholarly reliability but nonetheless underlies a not-significant amount of scholarly work[^cf27] --- its cultural capital as a resource lags far behind its use and utility. Project Gutenberg is easily conceived of as a haphazard, ‘unscholarly’ source for materials, but unlike Google Books, Project Gutenberg actually does have selection criteria. Project Gutenberg will only collect public domain works which contemporary audiences might be interested in reading for pleasure. It narrows the field substantially to exclude works which have either ceased to be broadly interesting (as in the case of most forgotten fiction), or which was never particularly interesting (as in the case of almanacs and tax codes). Project Gutenberg includes 57,796 texts: far more than specialized scholarly archives like the Early Novels Database or the Shelley-Godwin Archive, but nonetheless an order of magnitude fewer than its more-voracious potential competitors. And, like smaller specialized scholarly archives, Project Gutenberg has tailored its holdings to make it easy for readers to read, and quite difficult for its collection to be applied to any other use. By tailoring the structure of the archive itself to its specific materials, these collections are able to thoughtfully achieve their aims --- but they also make it correspondingly difficult for users[ does this not depend on the user? unpack] to achieve their own, different aims.

Some Statistics on the Number of Surviving Printed Titles for Great Britain and Dependencies from the Beginnings of Print in England to the year 1800, by Alain Veylit.   

1. I identify male/female ratios?  

Other work which has used the methodology of sampling includes 



Suarez: “Lacking the resources to conduct a detailed analysis of the entire ESTC from 1701 to 1800, I have resorted to sampling. Electing to examine all eighteenth-century records that appear in years ending in three -- 1703, 1713, 1723 and so on -- I have sought to avoid a number of cohort effects, most especially the cumulation of indeterminate records into years ending in ‘0’ or ‘1’ and, to a lesser degree, ‘5’.” (41)  

Before I develop custom code, I establish some baselines by taking a random sample of 100 titles from each of my key corpora. I manually identify the original publication date of each title, and whether that title appears reprinted elsewhere in the corpus.



As I expand to algorithmically examine the full corpora, I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words “Xth edition.”

If this method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ (as determined by comparison to my random sample) I won’t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles?

Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching... unless it’s small enough for me to do manually (unlikely)  

First, I make sure the data is “clean” and comparable to all the others:

\- Jan 1 1789 to Dec 31 1799

\- ENGLAND ONLY, no Ireland or Scotland

\- With ECCO, make sure I don’t have duplicate entries



I get a count of how many titles are in the corpus.



I use [random.org](http://random.org) to get 100 randomly-generated numbers. I use the “sequence” generator, not the “integer” generator.

## 1.3.  ch 3 - archive popularity ##  

Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity[ TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2^nd^ or 10^th^ edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.] in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share.[ Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.] After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.  

The Reading Experience Database contains over 30,000 searchable records documenting the history of reading in Britain from 1450 to 1945. Evidence comes from published and unpublished sources such as diaries, commonplace books, memoirs, sociological surveys, and criminal court and prison records.

A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.

The Female Gothic: New Directions (2009), edited by Andrew Smith and Diana Wallace. Avril Horner’s and Sue Zlosnik’s Edinburgh Companion on Women and the Gothic (2016) \[both do things\].

[^cf20]: Emma Clery’s Women’s Gothic (2000). The Female Gothic: New Directions (2009). Wallace D (2013) \*Female Gothic Histories\*. Murphy P (2016) \*The New Woman Gothic\*. \[TODO: Robert Miles, Alison Milbank\]. Even Barbara Benedict’s “‘Male’ and ‘Female’ Novels?”, which questions the premise of gender division in its title, refers with assurance to “the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world”.⁠1

[^cf25]: For example, a typical title in the English Short Title Catalogue for the decade is “The injustice and impolicy of the slave-trade, and of the slavery of the Africans: illustrated in a sermon preached before the Connecticut Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Persons Unlawfully Holden in Bondage, at their annual meeting in New-Haven, September 15, 1791. / By Jonathan Edwards, D.D. Pastor of a church in New-Haven. ; To which is added, A short sketch of the evidence for the abolition of the slave-trade, delivered before a committee of the British House of Commons.” The usefulness of this title, as an advertisement for (if not necessarily an accurate representative of!) the work’s content, I argue, presents an opportunity unique to the eighteenth century. The eighteenth century is often dismissed as unsuitable for computational distant reading because eighteenth century printed type produces very low-quality OCR transcripts --- but a focus on OCR-based distant reading itself seems to me like a response to the poverty of paratextual material in later literature.

Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99



My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like, in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers, and how this print landscape persists in archives. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on the existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine celebrity as evidenced by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices. The sixth and final chapter will, in some fashion, draw together my overarching concern with print culture as a social activity, to address debates about how to measure the popularity of printed books, and how to distinguish a popular from another title.



## ch 1 - intro ##



My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. As this chapter will establish, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, this chapter will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Defining the scope of my material, in addition to establishing my technological frameworks, also allows me to answer key questions about my chosen subject matter. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will set out the constraints I have set in my inquiry — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive) — and discuss the suitability of this eleven-year “decade”. [The choice of the 1790s implicitly supports an interest in the Gothic and in women’s writing. [I don’t beg the question by framing my questions as assuming the importance of Gothic / women, but I do anticipate that the questions I have asked will reveal their prominence.]] [transition], this chapter will do something about the 1790s as] a crucial literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form. When the eighteenth century [literary world? Who does this?] begins to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history begins to be interpreted into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. [Therefore, [this chapter will do something about] questions about archives and canons.] Having chosen the 1790s generally, the specific years are chosen to capture the major events of the French Revolution, reflecting an interest in politics. I am interested in politics as something that occurs between people rather than between parties; interested in ‘schools of thought’ and the complex individuality of those schools.) - Political affiliation, like literary genre, is not a matter of simple taxonomic classification. Therefore, this chapter will [X].



## ch 2 - archives ##



Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience flying to California in order to be taught about HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.



## ch 3 - archive popularity ##



Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. After developing a few different metrics for popularity, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? Why does one corpus show one popular thing, and another show another? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? One of the things I will do is Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare how famous various literary celebrities were over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might this affect what we define as "popular literature”.

## ch 4 - networks ##



Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses. [List some of it here! Include a brief lit review; address the major studies and their arguments] My project will consult this work to extract and encode the relationships between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts)[^cf1] in order to explicitly synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will [give] a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may show one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may show highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. The chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays, and present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s.



## ch 5 - networks popularity ##



Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of radical and mainstream printing circles. 

[By looking for clusters in the big hairball] I will Think about individual printers as having political allegiances (as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies) Authors choosing publishers strategically. My network graphs will model individual “politics” [as a complex, socially defined thing] rather than a set of concrete and unchanging ideological stances. 

Having identified the radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. Are they as socially estranged from the mainstream as they frame themselves? Are we not seeing these texts? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? (Complicate the story of popularity?) 

Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. 

I will also critically interrogate my own research practices, [seeking connections with work by people like [TL Cowan??]] to engage ethically with the intentional discovery and exposure of communities which intentionally operated “under the radar.” And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database?

## coda? - gothic ##



A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production. (Assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) My previous work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. This chapter could use a stylometric approach to computationally identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? (I expect it to be a lot.) What kinds of literary productions are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? Importantly, however, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a Gothic parody from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, I would take up Horner & Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy. 

[keep this in the back of my mind in case it turns out to have a place, but leave it off for now]

[it would nice to cite and build on my published Gothic work as part of the Gothic showing up on its own in mainstream/non-mainstream]



# Guiding Principles #



## Reparative Reading ##



"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."

"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



## Information Density ##



I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.



I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.



### Tufte's six principles of design: ###



1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences

2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't do anything with the information without causality)

3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate

4. *completely integrate* words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc. Provide information at exact point of need

5. documentation must thoroughly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales

6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.



keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your content



## Finish The Figures ##



It is disproportionally difficult to revisit a graph that is 80% complete to add the remaining finishing touches; before putting down one phase of a project, take the time to fully finish the figures as beautiful, print-resolution images.

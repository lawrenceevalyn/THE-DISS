Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99



My dissertation seeks to determine, at as minute a level of detail as possible, what the print landscape in England 1789-99 was actually like (in contrast to the filtered and interpreted literary histories which have been built up by scholars or later generations of writers), and how this print landscape persists in archives. As I investigate, I am concerned with some interrelated dichotomies which fall out of my larger concern: popularity versus seriousness, timeliness versus timelessness, and marginalization versus canonization. I want to ask how works that are now considered serious and timeless have achieved their prominent positions, and examine “unserious” or ephemeral works that reward further consideration. I thus wade directly into some of the most complex and contentious concerns of literary studies; my goal is to contribute something novel in my computational approaches, while taking part in the constant evolution of the current “canon.”

## intro - archive formation ##



My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on my decade.

My methodology situates me within queer DH and critical algorithm studies. I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan in undertaking reparative work on archives. My aspiration is to join a growing body of queer DH scholarship in developing a non-extractive, anti-oppressive, less neoliberal digital humanities methodology. Accordingly, I will present a humanistic critique of essentialist tendencies in simplistic digital projects, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty.

My subject matter situates me in a densely-discussed intersection of scholarly fields.



The years 1789-99 make an eleven-year “decade” delimited by the major events of the French Revolution, but also home to a crucial literary moment in which thematized literary canons begin to take form. 

18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernacular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. 



The introduction will also address who my scholarly interlocutors are in treating the 1790s as its own small literary period. [Britain, England, or London?] 



## ch 1 - digital corpora ##



Chapter two examines corpora of eighteenth century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives increasingly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions.

 The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth century texts (at least, the ones containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place is useful as a lit review; adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria brings it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions as archives “specialize” from bibliographic data to facsimiles to transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience flying to California in order to be taught about HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible.

Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to ameliorate them. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious to see if even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter.

Current materials acquired include:

* 51,965 bibliographic entries in the English Short Title Catalogue

*42,463 facsimiles in Eighteenth Century Collections Online

* 10,832 facsimiles in 12 archives of Nineteenth Century Collections Online

* 4,381 facsimiles with OCR transcription in the HathiTrust Digital Library

* 466 XML files created by the ECCO Text Creation Partnership

Also under consideration is Project Gutenberg (as the corpus everyone uses but no one likes to admit to using).

The second chapter thus establishes the corpora with which I will answer my subsequent questions.



## ch 2 - mainstream press ##



Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about celebrity and reprinting into this chapter)





Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)

Chapter two introduces the driving stakes of the dissertation: it asks what long-term impact literary celebrity has on an author’s legacy, particularly for male versus female authors. I want to contextualize individual writers’ claims both to popularity (Hannah More) and to obscurity (William Wordsworth). I hypothesize that some level of celebrity assists male authors in achieving long-lasting legacies, but that celebrity is of no help to female authors, and may even harm the perceived “seriousness” of their reputations. Influenced by Ashley J. Cross’s “From Lyrical Ballads to Lyrical Tales: Mary Robinson's Reputation and the Problem of Literary Debt,” I am interested in exploring the careers of Mary Robinson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as my “case study” for this chapter. The technical challenge in this chapter lies in developing metrics for “popularity,” “celebrity,” and “legacy” which are both fruitful and nuanced. In addition to reading the extensive literature grappling with these concerns for individual authors, I am currently thinking of ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles as an index of celebrity, and posthumous printings as an index of legacy. I may also add scholarly uptake (perhaps through the proxy of  JSTOR articles, since JSTOR makes their archive accessible for experiments of this type) as a particular sub-type of “legacy.”





Taking up David Brewer’s challenge in “Counting, Resonance, and Form” to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, my third chapter turns it attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting (or, in the case of plays, re-staging). The chapter’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in this decade? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? As in my first chapter, the “case study” texts for this chapter will emerge from my broader research. I am particularly eager to investigate timely re-stagings of plays, given the heightened ephemerality and thus timeliness of theatrical productions compared to print; my first step is to assemble a precise timeline of what was staged during the period. For printed works, some initial exploration suggests that Shakespeare, Oliver Goldsmith, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Johnson, or Milton are prominent in the English Short Title Catalogue and therefore might be of interest. I will need to determine what distinction, if any, I might want to draw between “canonical” authors like Shakespeare and Milton, whose posthumous prominence is predictable, and any shorter-lived targeted reprintings that I might discover.



My fourth chapter takes a different tack to focus on widely-read works that are often excluded from “1790s literature”: chapbooks. These are usually excluded for not being “literature” rather than not being “1790s” (though part of my inquiry will also be to determine how ‘out of date’ chapbooks would get before reaching their readers, and how this compares to book publishing). This print-historical chapter seeks to explore what is often seen as a “gap” in William St. Clair’s history, to see how much we do know about the chapbook trade. I am particularly interested in pamphlets produced in response to other pamphlets, and whether there are geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness. This chapter will of course address Hannah More’s Cheap Repository Tracts, but I am equally curious about the works among which hers were sold. My “case study” could trace the printing and circulation of one of More’s pamphlets and some of its fellow-travellers, as the foundation for a discussion of More’s hybrid literary forms. 



Another argument I hope to advance is that literary works can be considered relevant to a given literary period, even after their original publication; my third chapter turns its attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered as important “1790s literature” due to successive re-printings during that decade.





## ch 3 - radical press ##



Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strategically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?

My fifth chapter builds on the work of Michael Gamer and others,  describes the relationship of the Gothic to Romanticism. This chapter could be well-served by a stylometric approach, examining “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, to explore the reach of the Gothic. I am particularly interested in comparing the strategies used by writers who wish to use Gothic materials without “being” Gothic (like Hannah More and William Wordsworth), those who accept being Gothic but without being “unserious” (like Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Smith), and those who embrace both the Gothic and its charge of unseriousness. Matthew Lewis may provide a useful case study for debates about “redeeming literary value” in the Gothic.



## conclusion ##



The dissertation as a whole, then, looks at the same large body of texts (works printed in England 1789-99) through several different, but interconnected, lenses. Only some of these lenses have specific computational projects in mind already, but all of them ask questions at a scale where I know I will want at least a spreadsheet, and quite probably much more, in order to bring together the many pieces of information that I examine. I expect some works and lines of thought to re-emerge in multiple chapters as I clarify the connections between my central concepts.



# Guiding Principles #



## Reparative Reading ##



"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."

"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



## Information Density ##



I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.



I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.



### Tufte's six principles of design: ###



1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences

2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't do anything with the information without causality)

3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate

4. *completely integrate* words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc. Provide information at exact point of need

5. documentation must thoroughly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales

6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.



keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your content



## Finish The Figures ##



It is disproportionally difficult to revisit a graph that is 80% complete to add the remaining finishing touches; before putting down one phase of a project, take the time to fully finish the figures as beautiful, print-resolution images.



## I'm Not Writing About ##



… reception history outside the 1790s.

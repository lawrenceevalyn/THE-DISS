## background ##







This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.



## driving research Qs ##







My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.



## critical context ##







This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. 



## methods ##



### model 1: ESTC ###







The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 



I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.



### model 2: ECCO-TCP ###







I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.



### model 3: reading ###







Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.



## conclusion ##







Although I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will research them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be said to be “representative” of this decade? And what do they “represent”?

## Problem statement ##



### Research questions ###







My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?



How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?



How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?







do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially? How different are the writers and audiences for each medium? I also anticipate finding new insight into the forms and popularity of political writing in the period: how much of the work being consumed is presented with explicit political aims? What mediums are most-used for different political positions? In a somewhat separate line of inquiry, I will explore in-depth the works of the individuals authors under consideration: how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? 



Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my key writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers?



What texts should we teach to students? And how should we contextualize them?



(Step 1 is to be true to the variety of the period, but also true to its chief emphasis.)

### publishers visible over authors ###







The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by “Great Britain”, and dwarfed again by the works by “null” authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.



> What would it mean for one person (let alone work!) to be “important”?



> What exactly am I trying to describe here??



### authors development = publisher choices ###







Radcliffe is remarkably stable in her choice of publisher



When Smith begins to branch out into more political radical works, she needs to branch out into new publishers as well



Robinson: ???



More accomplishes her stunning volume of work partly by being a publisher as much as she is an author. (See: The Apprentice’s Monitor) Her shifting publisher data is mostly information on the Cheap Repository Tracts. [But I was cautioned that these dates are less reliable! Ignore chronological information over sheer quantity? This also addresses the other difficulties re: there being too many publishers to show as a timeline]



### prominence of the "back catalogue" ###







Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.

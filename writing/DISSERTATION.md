Title: DISSERTATION  
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

# ch 2 - archives #



Chapter two takes up contemporary digital archives directly, examining corpora of eighteenth-century literature through the same critical lens by which anthologies and classroom teaching are often scrutinized. It makes the case that digital archives can implicitly shape scholarly research, and begins the process of revealing and interrogating their invisible assumptions. The chapter begins with a task somewhere between a literature review and a scientific meta-analysis. My first goal will be to survey as broadly as possible the accessible mass holdings of eighteenth-century texts (all those containing at least 100 works from the 1790s): simply putting all of this information in one place will be a useful way to review it. Adding a discussion of each archive’s selection criteria will bring it into the realm of a meta-analysis. I expect to find systematic exclusions where archives are investing more labour in their holdings, with narrower selections as they move from bibliographic data to facsimiles to scholarly transcripts. To contextualize these decisions about inclusion, I will research the history of how each corpus was formed. I will discuss and theorize the difficulties involved in researching these histories: drawing on, for example, my experience with HathiTrust’s codebase, I will critique the assumption that digital resources make all information transparent and accessible. Returning to the actual contents of each archive, I will discuss the nature of their exclusions, and consider paths to greater inclusivity. Then I will synthesize these disparate sources of texts and metadata, a substantial technical challenge, to see how the task may be accomplished, and to see what correlations between archives might illuminate the decade. I am particularly curious whether even one text will appear in all corpora, and, if so, which one it will be. Whichever texts appear most persistently will form the basis of my “case study” in this chapter. The second chapter thus establishes the corpora which will drive my argument in chapter three, and will shape the later phases of my research in chapters four and five.

### lit review ###



I plan to read secondary criticism for two major kinds of information, both of which will form the “lit review” section of chapter two. For each work I read, I will record the following:



Numbers against which I can compare my findings:

- Titles per year

- Authors, signed vs unsigned

- Authors, female vs male vs unknown

- Publication location



Assumptions against which I can compare my methodology:

- Treatment of reprints

- Circulation assumptions

- Excluded categories

- Genre ontology



#### Lesser & Farmer debate ####



Do these citations with some kind of LaTeX to learn that process

A model for my work can be found in a methodological debate within the study of Early Modern drama, when Farmer & Lesser introduced revisions to Blayney’s field-changing 1997 essay “The Publication of Playbooks.” Blayney’s “detailed statistical analysis of the market for printed plays” (F&L 4) argues that “never accounted for a very significant fraction of the trade in English books” (B, qtd in F&L 3) and that, based on their reprinting rate of “only” 48% of first editions, “no more than one play in five would have returned the publisher’s initial investment inside five years” (B, qtd in F&L 4). F&L argue that “ like all previous arguments about the popularity of playbooks, Blayney’s is flawed at a fundamental level because it does not systematically compare the market performance of playbooks to that of other kinds of books” (F&L 4). In response, therefore, “Using the same four criteria that Blayney employs—total number of editions, market share, frequency of reprinting, and profitability—but extending his research to include comparisons with other kinds of books, we will argue that playbooks were, in fact, far more popular than Blayney contends.” (F&L 4). Total number of editions and frequency of reprinting To properly contextualize market share, they carefully compare plays only to other “speculative” non-monopoly works (L&F 14). “Plays were, in fact, among the most successful books in which an early modern stationer could choose to invest.” (F&L 6). F&L stress that they study playbooks, not playtexts.

The crucial intervention of F&L’s first article is the comparison of playbooks to the marketplace at large, and to another genre (sermons), since “popularity is ipso facto a relative term” (F&L 4). Also useful is the disentanglement of different metrics of popularity, since “Contrary to what one might have assumed, a higher market share did not always correlate with a higher reprint rate.” (F&L 26): “Sermons, for example, claimed a much greater share of the speculative market, but playbooks were far more likely to reach a second edition; so which class of books was more “popular”? … For reasons both cultural and economic, different kinds of books may have sold in different ways, may have had different structures of popularity.” (F&L 27)

Blayney’s response take issue, first, with the books which Farmer & Lesser choose to exclude, and, second, with their comparisons of percentages rather than counts. Many of his critiques rest on Early Modern historical details not relevant to my inquiry, such as his argument against Farmer & Lesser’s claim that “patented books were produced under fundamentally different economic conditions than other books” (L&F 17, qtd in B 38). His methodological critiques, however, are immediately applicable: regarding the comparison of reprinting percentages, he notes, “the authors ignore an elementary arithmetical truism that completely vitiates their main conclusion. Simply put, a small percentage of a large number can be much bigger than a large percentage of a small number” (B 43). This is where I am inclined to stick with Farmer & Lesser — Blayney seems to be ignoring the viewpoint from which the matter is being considered. If you have a playbook in one hand and a sermon-book in the other, which one is more likely to be reprinted? The answer to that question will have nothing to do with the total number of playbooks and sermon-books printed each year; since the question is predictive, rather than evaluative, it relies on percentages. Farmer & Lesser ultimately want to contend that publishers would have published more plays if more plays had existed, that any given playbook had decent odds of turning a profit.

I do agree with Blayney’s central argument is that “Market share in the real world is not always greatly affected by what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell, and is not determined at all by what academics subsequently choose to study. What counts is what the customers actually buy.” (B 40). But this seems to miss Farmer & Lesser’s core point that market share is not the only metric of popularity, and that “what publishers (sometimes wrongly) think will sell” is its own valuable kind of popularity to examine.

Moreover, even if, as Blayney persuasively supports the numbers showing that, of the playbooks, “no more than 107 (32.2 percent), and perhaps only 104 (31.3 percent)” (45), he still has not addressed Farmer & Lesser’s need to address the choice of the qualifier “only” (L&F 3). By his own numbers, [what’s the fate of sermon-books??]



#### How do people determine popularity? ####



	1.	(Reprinting) Simon Bainbridge: best-selling, most-reprinted, most-adapted

	2.	(Assertion) George Taylor: simply asserts that some things are popular

	3.	(Assertion) Peter Murphy: despite promising that his study “examines the tension between the material, economic pressures motivating poetry as an occupation, and traditional notions of the forces of literary history,” Murphy says NOTHING AT ALL about how well, to whom, for how much, etc etc things were sold.

	4.	(Performances) Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, et al.: number of performances per play (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory)

	5.	(Book history) Cronin: mostly asserts that people are “popular” or “celebrated”; with Erasmus Darwin, supports this by saying that the book The Botanic Garden is beautiful & expensive

	6.	(Editions, reprints, market share, profitability) Lesser & Farmer, Structures of Popularity in the Early Modern Book Trade - “we need to consider both total number of editions and frequency of reprinting, as well as market share and profitability. No single one of these four measurements by itself equates directly to popularity in the book trade; each addresses different questions about the market performance of books, and each points to a different aspect of both supply and demand.” (208)

	7.	(Title counts) MacLeod on the Minerva press — evaluates most popular authors & subgenres based on the number of “works published” or “titles” (unclear if this includes reprints)





#### popularity is actually impossible ####



It is not, in fact, possible to calculate 



Without [certain kinds of evidence], as F&L note, “we will never be able to ascertain precisely the “popularity” of various kinds of books… if by popularity we mean something like the modern best-seller lists.”

Would need size of print runs and cost to produce, as well as sale price, and quantity sold.

[So it’s a little nonsense when people just say that something is popular]



#### Numbers to compare to ####



Comedies vs tragedies performed: the ratio of comedies to tragedies performed was an astonishing 14 to 1 in Paris (Theatre, Opera, and Audience in Revolutionary Paris: Analysis and Repertory by Emmet Kennedy, Marie-Laurence Netter, James P. McGregor, and Mark V. Olsen)



### corpora ###



#### selection criteria ####



The full scope of my project is to grapple with every online database which contains at least 100 texts meeting my criteria: printed, in England, between the years 1789-99. 

I exclude databases of diaries or correspondence, since they are not printed. This has the effect of excluding single-author databases.



#### women's archives ####



I make an exception for archives which specifically seek to address gaps in archival holdings due to systemic bias, that is, three archives focused on women’s writing: Orlando, Chawton, and [I thought there was a third one].

For the most part archives are either comprehensive and have significantly more than 100 texts, or they are single-author / single-researcher focused, and thus have significantly less than 100. These kinds of reparative projects occupy the middle space.



#### excluded corpora ####



Chawton House - too few novels

Gentleman’s Magazine resources - can’t filter by date

Lewis Walpole images digital collection at Yale - can’t filter by date

The Oxford Text Archive seems to be synonymous with ECCO-TCP; where it’s not, it’s not filterable by date/origin



U Sydney SETIS texts (paywalled) - http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/setweb/uslsetistexts.html#english



#### these are all databases ####



The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)



What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.

A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.



#### so what? ####



These basic factual questions, about what is in the various eighteenth century digital corpora that represent “mass” 18thC holdings for scholars, matter because []. Even though the specific numbers are likely to change as these digital holdings are continuously updated, my investigation of an archive “snapshot” matters because [they show how questions of fact can (and cannot) be answered?]



### demographics ###



#### titles per year ####



#### men vs women vs unsigned ####



Can I identify male/female ratios?



## reprints ##



### methods ###



I start with the simplest/dumbest way to identify a reprint: looking on its title page for the words “Xth edition.”

If this method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ I won’t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles?

Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching… unless it’s small enough for me to do manually (unlikely)



### what's "normal"? ###



Computationally identify reprints in ECCO

Take a random sample for which I attempt to locate size of print run

Come up with a number that would be a "lot" of reprints vs "not a lot" (to gauge popularity generally)

How old were books, usually? (i.e., how long ago was their first edition)



### compare archives ###



Compare most-reprinted texts overall to inclusions in smaller archives



### sample: print runs ###



Radcliffe doesn’t need many editions because her print runs started out large — take a random sample and see if I can find print runs for the works

Compare the popularity order produced by raw edition count to the one normalized by print run — what’s the error rate?



Ask Tom how to find these numbers (it’s not in databases, but I can read a paper book! — This is one of the things that makes my methodology not 100% DH)



### close read: Paine vs WW vs Blake ? ###



### close read: something old? ###



Any cool “1790s lit” not written in the 1790s? Shakespeare? Goldsmith?



## topics ##



### methods ###



Develop some kind of ontology of topic that encompasses "everything" (sticking to 18thC frameworks of, e.g., history vs romance)



#### topic modelling ####



I turn to topic modelling as a way to move “laterally”: if I can only query attributes which every archive records, I can’t query anything at all.



### sample: truthful titles ###



Take a random sample to see how accurate titles are to contents overall



### compare archives ###



Count how many works of each topic appear in each archive -- what kinds of content has been excluded in each, esp. in ECCO-TCP



### what's "normal"? ###



Make my own guesses as to what the print landscape was like, and what this means (close-read something interesting that emerges, perhaps works that misrepresent their contents)



### close read: ? ###



## conclusions ##



### compare archives ###



 Which of these archives are the most "reliable", and which the most "distorted"? (obvs interrogate this framework)

	•	What’s in all these, anyway?

	⁃	What does ECCO-TCP leave out compared to ECCO? Compared to ESTC? (Can I come up with adjustment factors?)

	⁃	How do digital vs physical holdings compare?



### what's "normal"? ###



What is a "normal" footprint in the print culture of this decade? (i.e., what are the boundaries a work has to surpass to be unusually popular or unusually unpopular?)



# THE DISS #



## proposal intro ##



Print Politics in the Digital Archive, 1789–99



My dissertation seeks to determine, in as minute detail as possible, what the print landscape[ TK: Books only, or also serials, periodicals, newspapers, print ephemera (for the 1790s, there are a lot of things like handbills and broadsides in ECCO)? A fairly restrictive definition might be wise …  ] in England 1789-99 was actually like  — in contrast to the version that is presented in filtered and interpreted literary histories, built up by scholars or later generations of writers — and how this print landscape is represented now, in current digital archives[ TK: This will be very valuable, but of course you’re dealing here with a moving target and one subject to sudden transformations as well as gradual / incremental changes. Not sure what the solution is here but it’s something to thing about. Presumably you can’t make this chapter the last thing you do if you need the data for later chapters – or can you?]. My first chapter establishes the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation. Chapter two turns a critical eye on existing digital archives that feature material printed in the 1790s. Chapter three uses these corpora of 1790s literature to examine the idea of “popularity” as it is manifested by print culture. Chapter four introduces a second substantial experiment, a comprehensive mapping of the social networks underlying print production during the decade. Chapter five uses these networks to compare mainstream and non-mainstream printing practices[ TK: NB that you tend to use printing and publishing a bit too interchangeably. Presumably this one should be publishing practices? Print technologies are also changing in this era but that’s a whole different story, not part of yours I would imagine.]. A possible afterword or coda may discuss the role of the Gothic across the textual landscape.



## ch 1 - intro ##



My first chapter sets out the vocabulary and theoretical frameworks of the dissertation, with an explanation of why I have chosen to focus on the 1790s. As this chapter will discuss, I follow the work of scholars like T.L. Cowan and Jasmine Rault in understanding my research as a kind of reparative work on archives. I hope to locate my project alongside others in the DH field, led by scholars who are seeking to develop less “extractive” and more anti-oppressive[ Is there a better term? (why did TK think I wanted “anti-interpretive”?)] digital humanities methodologies. My first chapter will present a humanistic critique of the essentialist tendencies of some work in the field of DH, and discuss the pitfalls I have attempted to avoid in my own methodology. In discussing my methods, I will take up Johanna Drucker’s vocabulary of “capta,” rather than “data,” to emphasize that records are created, shaped by choices and by constraints, rather than neutrally “given.” I will apply insights from the emerging field of critical algorithm studies to reflect on the code I have written for the project, and the importance of engaging with digital projects at the level of code. I will also discuss my own preferred vocabulary around experiment design (modelling, sensitivity, fruitfulness), and its debts to Willard McCarty. Turning, then, from my tools to my materials, this chapter will also set out the limits to the project — material printed in Great Britain between January 1, 1789 and December 31, 1799 (inclusive). I will describe the importance of my selection of this this eleven-year “decade” to test my methods. A brief literature review of the literary output of the 1790s[ TK: Can you clarify this? Are you talking about the focus of the recent scholarship, or the focus of the writers at the time? As you rightly indicate elsewhere, these two things may not match -- your project might show the preoccupations of modern scholarship to be projections of our own rather than an accurate reflection of what dominated at the time. But “decade-long focus” makes it sound as though you’re talking about the 1790s writers themselves, i.e. accepting that “our” 1790s (dominated by, say, Thelwall and Wollstonecraft) is the same as the “real” one (though that might turn out to have been dominated by, say, Edmund Burke and Hannah More).] will highlight a decade-long focus on politics, the Gothic, and women writers.[ Although all of these elements interest me, and I anticipate that attention to this decade will reveal their prominence, I seek to avoid framing my inquiry explicitly around them and thus begging the question of their importance.] Finally, this chapter will bring together modern theories of the archive and my eighteenth century materials, by discussing the 1790s as a literary moment in which some significant literary canons begin to take form. When eighteenth century editors began to collect an English vernacular tradition posited against a Classical past and a French present, the “archive” of literary history was filtered into “canons” of texts, with connotations of merit and implications for national identity. The divergence between archive and canon motivates my return to the archive.

## ch 3 - archive popularity ##



Chapter three expands upon the findings of the experiment carried out in chapter two, to examine popularity as it manifests in print culture. Influenced by Lesser and Farmer’s articulation of “structures of popularity,” I will consider popularity[ TK: Another tricky one. Might be best to avoid “popularity” unless you’re also going to factor in (as would be very hard) questions like print-runs (a nightmare imponderable), circulation (something aimed at libraries might have many more readers per copy than a book for home), unauthorized newspaper serializations, anthologization (is that a word?), false title pages (where a self-proclaimed 2nd or 10th edition might actually be just a new tp on remaindered sheets of a first edn that hasn’t sold. You could imagine (and this may have happened in practice) a novel published just once in 2,000 copies being more popular than one claiming five editions, none of which may have been more than 500 copies, and some of which may not have been true new editions at all. But which would come up as more popular give your metrics? This is all really tricky stuff and I think you’ll need a thorough discussion of the issues and assumptions.] in terms of total number of editions, frequency of reprinting, and market share.[ Lesser and Farmer also include profitability as one of the four measurements relevant to popularity in the book trade, but profitability is beyond the current scope of this project.] After determining how to calculate each of these metrics, I will ask: what was most popular during the decade, according to my corpora? How do the corpora differ in their answers, and why? I am particularly curious to see the place that chapbooks and religious tracts have in each corpus. My preliminary research suggests that many of the most reprinted works will substantially pre-date the 1790s in their composition. Accordingly, taking up David Brewer’s challenge to account for the increased “footprint” of some texts beyond the moment of their original publication, I will also pay attention to works originally written before the 1790s which nonetheless can be considered important “1790s literature” due to prominent reprinting. This inquiry’s first question is one of discovery: what works resurface in the 1790s? Its next question is one of close-reading and historical context: what makes them seem newly relevant? Restricting my inquiry only to the 1790s rather than nineteenth-century legacies, I will use my corpora to compare the publication output of various literary celebrities over the course of the decade. In addition to looking at the raw publication counts in the corpora defined in chapter two, I am currently exploring ways to use mentions in reviews and news articles to track prominence and reputation. The chapter as a whole, then, presents a sustained study of the relative popularity of the most prominent works printed during the 1790s, and seeks to answer how these prominent works might affect what we define as “popular literature”.

## ch 4 - networks ##



Chapter four introduces my second major experiment, a mapping of the social world of print production 1789-99. As in chapter two, it will be a substantial technical and research project simply to recover contemporary printing practices; this time, rather than asking what was printed, I will ask who it was printed by. A great deal of scholarly work[ TK: Jon Mee, Kevin Gilmartin and Paul Keen are others who would be important here. Plus scholars who focus more on conservatism, perhaps M. O. Grenby for example? Or even much earlier work by Marilyn Butler?] already exists on printing circles, coterie publishing, and individual publishing houses.[^cf3] My project will consult this scholarship to extract and encode connections between authors, printers, and publishers (but not patrons, readers, or other persons not immediately involved in the production of texts) in order to synthesize the implicit social networks underlying 1790s print production. I will begin my research for this chapter by encoding only a few existing studies, in order to evaluate the feasibility of my method at scale. It is possible that, rather than directly consulting the more richly historically-informed work of other scholars, I will instead fall back on inferring networks from the author and publisher metadata included with the corpora examined in chapters two and three. The resulting chapter will explain my methodology and its assumptions, and will provide a rich description of my resulting network graph. The graph I create may reveal one large interconnected network, or several separate networks of varying sizes; these networks may consist of highly distinct clusters, or evenly interconnected webs. Drawing on mathematical graph theory, the chapter will explain the implications of whichever shape the network ultimately displays. It will also present an overview of the people I identify as the “major players” in the publishing world of the 1790s, both mathematically (looking for nodes with various kinds of centrality) and in the scholarship.



### British Book Trade Index ###



OBVIOUSLY this work should be built on the back of the British Book Trade Index, I can’t BELIEVE nobody told me about it!!

## ch 5 - networks popularity ##



Having recaptured these complex networks in some depth, I can then examine them, in chapter five, for their relation to our current understanding of mainstream and radical — or as I am terming them “mainstream” and “non-mainstream” — printing circles. My network graphs will model individual political affiliation as a complex, socially defined practice rather than a taxonomy of concrete and unchanging ideological stances.[ TK: Excellent point, especially in these fast-changing years. But again, this looks like potentially very daunting. Stable binaries are so much more convenient for scholars to work with! I’m excited to see what you come up with here.] This chapter will look for traces of affiliation in the print practices of publishers and of authors. I will consider individual printers with political allegiances, as in Dissenting societies, radical publishers, correspondence societies. This will then enable me to consider authors’ strategic choices as they publish with different printers[ TK: Again presumably you mean publishers not printers? NB too that the choice could work the other way round: authors for hire being commissioned by publishers to write something suitable for a list. I don’t know much about the Minerva Press, but I imagine that’s the way this kind of publisher would have operated, at least in part.]. Having identified radical elements in the publishing world, I will interrogate the radicals’ claims to marginalization. I suspect that I might find that they were not as socially estranged from the mainstream as they describe themselves, and that their printed works may accordingly have been less marginal. I will discuss alternative print markets and alternative circulation, and what kind of “alternatives” they offer to the mainstream. The circulation of works in manuscript presents me two challenges which will be discussed here. The first challenge is methodological: the circulation of manuscripts clearly occurred, and may have constituted “publication” within social circles, but manuscripts fall outside my purview[ TK: Yes, goodness, yes! You can deal with this via a brief discussion of recent scholarship on the persistence of manuscript culture and association practices e.g. Betty Schellenberg, Aileen Douglas, Michelle Levy, I would have thought.]. This chapter will therefore discuss the nature and rough shape of the gap which the exclusion of manuscript works leaves in my study. The second task of this chapter is more theoretical: as queer and decolonial DH scholars note, there is an ethical choice implicated in the decision to systematically discover, collect, and expose communities which intentionally operated below the notice of state observation. Historical distance prevents me from worrying about causing direct harm through my work, but nonetheless I will critically interrogate my own research practices and contextualize my choices within the horizon of expectations of the radical circles I (and other scholars) expose. Finally, having discussed the networks of radical and mainstream publishing in the 1790s, I will also compare the position of radical publishers in the 1790s with their status in the corpora discussed in chapters two and three (where they may in fact be marginalized; I expect to find conservative works overrepresented in the corpora). Together, these approaches will further complicate the story of popularity which the dissertation challenges elsewhere, by suggesting ways to reassess of the popularity of radical works.



## coda? - gothic ##



A potential coda or afterword could build on the work of Robert Miles and others to describe the role of the Gothic as a trans-generic mode which can appear across all print production (assuming that turns out to be true, of course.) Some of my earlier work suggests that Gothic modes of writing, unlike most literary content, can be “spotted” computationally. Since the Gothic operates by means of distinctive tropes and sensory appeals, the Gothic parts of a history and the Gothic parts of a picaresque can be distinguished from the non-Gothic parts of each by computational methods that could not distinguish a history from a picaresque. (Importantly, stylometric methods are not able to distinguish a parody of the Gothic from a “real” Gothic; as I theorize and interpret my findings, then, I would take up Horner and Zlosnik’s work on Gothic humour to discuss the problem of parody in taxonomy.) This final section could use a stylometric approach to identify and then search for “Gothic vocabularies” in full texts, computationally, in order to quantify the reach of the Gothic across my corpora. How many works can be identified as having Gothic influences? What kinds of literary production are most resistant to the Gothic? Does the Gothic appear differently in mainstream vs radical presses? This afterword would sketch out a preliminary map of the Gothic in the print world of the 1790s. This closing section would thus cite and build upon my prior work with the Gothic, in the context of the 1790s as a period when the penetration of Gothic modes into mainstream print had particularly complex political stakes.

### ECCO ###



My ECCO metadata presented particular challenges. I had access to MARC records, which stands for MAchine Readable Catalogue. At several points, I read this data with my feeble non-machine eyes in order to guide my data processing. Using MarcEdit, I converted these MARC records to csv files which could, on OpenRefine, be read, manipulated, and merged like my other corpora. Since I was not able to simply convert “all the MARC headings that exist” using MarcEdit, I used all numbers 1 to 999 and [will] delete empty columns.

ECCO encodes much of its data in “unassigned” columns, rather than the standardized LOC categories.

Other promising titles include Social networks in the long eighteenth century : clubs, literary salons, textual coteries, ed. Ileana Baird; and The enlightenment & the book : Scottish authors & their publishers in eighteenth-century Britain, Ireland & America, by Richard B. Sher, to capture different parts of the publishing landscape.

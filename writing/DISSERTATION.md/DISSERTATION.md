Title: DISSERTATION
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

# Guiding Principles #







Literally every idea I have for “research”, of any kind, goes in this document.



One snippet per “thought.”



Let it all accumulate into groupings organically.



Look for crossover between ideas, multiple ways of approaching a given subject. Similarity of experimental method does not in itself constitute a connection.



## Reparative Reading ##







"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."



"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



## Information Density ##







I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.







I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.



# Questions #



## what to do with so much lit? ##







My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?



### how to select texts? ###







How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?



### what do we teach? in what context? ###







What texts should we teach to students? And how should we contextualize them?



### how to identify genres? ###







How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?



### how do literary fads move? ###







do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially?



### how do audiences differ? ###







How different are the writers and audiences for each medium?	



### what is "normal" in the 1790s? ###







What do my corpora tell us about what was ‘normal’ during my decade?



What does it mean to be “normal” or to seek the “normal” over the exceptional?



## how political is 1790s lit? ##







I also anticipate finding new insight into the forms and popularity of political writing in the period: how much of the work being consumed is presented with explicit political aims?



### what genres for what politics? ###







What mediums are most-used for different political positions?



## author case studies ##







In a somewhat separate line of inquiry, I will explore in-depth the works of the individuals authors under consideration: how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? 



### how do they use genre? ###







how do they use each of the generic mediums available to them? How do they adapt their ideas to each form, and how do they conceive of each audience? 



### are they "representative"? ###







Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my key writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers?



## women in carriages ##



### how often do women get grabbed? ###







How often, in 18thC novels, do women get grabbed into carriages? Is this a stock trope?



- Clarissa



- Emmeline



- ??? Wolfenbach?



### what happens when they're grabbed? ###







What typically happens to them once they get grabbed? Do men and women write different kinds of outcomes?



### why? is it Clarissa? ###







Is it because of Clarissa, or did it start before then?



## Shakespeare in the 18thC ##



### what plays get quoted most? ###



### what parts of plays get quoted most? ###



### do men and women use Shakey differently? ###



### which writers write from full plays, which from extracts? ###



### is Shakespeare an 18thC author? ###



## 18thC transitional tragedy ##



### can I spot the "first" plays to make shifts? ###







Can I make a “canon” of “first outliers” over time?



### what is the role of the audience? ###







If the audience is a node in the social network, can we tell who they are meant to sympathise with?



## what is left out of corpora? ##



### is ECCO "representative"? ###



### is HathiTrust "representative?" or reliable?? ###



## what is the "theory" of literary history? ##







Moretti: evolutionary selection? Centre-periphery?



Or is it something else?



Why do we need a theory?



"I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (Moretti Distant Reading 145)



## can I make a reverse recommendation engine? ##







Is there a way I could use JSTOR information & ESTC information to identify popular but under-studied writers? Or to generate for any given reader a list of five names likely to be very different from what they're currently reading? Reverse recommendation engines?



## Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson ##







http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=wilksa



## is decanonization my model? ##







Like decolonialization? (Though that is likely an appropriative framework)



### how can we decanonize Wordsworth? ###







(And Coleridge and the other Romantics… especially Blake)



One part is bursting open all their self-indulgent mythmaking



### how can we decanonize Jane Austen? ###







Goodness gracious, do we even WANT to?



But she’s really so unlike everyone else…



#### When and how was Austen canonized? ####







Broadview p XL: “Austen’s works are now seen to hold a central position in the history of the novel” — did they not before??



## are Gothic novels usually fragmentary? ##







They seems to be prone to the proliferation of subplots, but they are much more invested in plot threads and wrapping-up than, say, The Man of Feeling, or Tristram Shandy, which are frankly picaresque



(Sentimental narratives are fragmentary, often skipping straight to the good bits — if the gothic has its roots in the sentimental, is this something that carries over? Or does the gothic laboriously fill in all the connective tissue?)



## What models of 18thC publishers' social networks already exist? ##



## Are Hookham, Carpenter, and Hookham & Carpenter three publishers or one? ##



## How big were the print runs for each of the works published by my four authors? ##



## Does the ESTC works-per-year graph match the Garside?  ##



## Is the number of "null" (unsigned) authors associated with the Minerva Press proportionate to the overall number of "null" authors? ##



## potential experiment ideas ##

### Network of the Chawtons? ###

### Networks of 18thC plays? ###

### Genre identification? ###

### Bibliographical metadata? ###



#### ? ####

### Text analysis of Corvey? ###

## can I use reviews to identify popular / important works? ##







Where are all these reviews collected? Can I put them in my relational database?



Can I come up with some kind of measure like “surprise” in that model of Darwin’s reading habits, to see when something makes a splash?



Can I see which things get used as points of reference in reviews of other works?



## Why was Frankie a "revival" of Gothic but not others? ##







read all the Gothics that also came out in 1818, for context for Frankenstein: why was it remembered as a revival when the others weren’t?







## how can Powis Castle satirize in 1788 something which ##







how can Powis Castle satirize in 1788 something which barely even exists yet?



## will Garside just GIVE me data 1789-99???? ##







Can I… ask?



### will William St Clair????? ###



## read just first and last pages of novels?? ##







Can I make useful assessments by reading just the first and last page of a whole bunch of novels??



## Network of reuse of character names in the Gothic ##







Network of reuse of character names in the Gothic??



## in/out-degrees of she-heroines in networks? ##







I would be really interested to know each character's ratio for being the source vs the target of speech -- how much more does Hamlet talk to others than they talk to him? How does he compare to everybody else? This seems really easy to calculate from the information already found, I just never thought to look at it until the student's thesis mentioned Hamlet's in-degree and out-degree numbers.



## sideline later: timeline of Revolution ##







see if French Revolution deaths track with summer heat or escalating price of bread (hypothesis: yes)



my guess is, everybody gets murderous when they are hot, hungry, and worried that they are losing their various wars



the “status of the wars” would be harder to stick onto an X-axis but the overall thing appeals as a response to the famous map of Napoleon’s march into Russia



Alex: “sure -sounds fab. that one I also check off - though I'd argue for after fields, after a couple of articles are in with readers”



## crying in jails ##







Is the stock sentimental trope of crying in a jail marked by continuity or discontinuity in its meaning, during the French Revolution?



[Crying in a jail means something different before and after the Revolution; the uses of emotion gain new possible powers] [So these same sentiments gain new importance and need a new name, the Gothic, when they collide with political realities]



### Vicar of Wakefield crying in jail ###



### Two Shoemakers crying in jail ###







Two Shoemakers: The gaoler observed him drop a tear, and asked the cause. I cannot forget, said he, that the most dissolute of these men is still my fellow-creature. The same GOD made them; the same SAVIOUR died for them; how then can I hate the worst of them? With my advantages they might have been much better than I am; without the blessing of GOD on my good Minister's instructions, I might have been worse than the worst of these. I have no cause for pride, much for thankfulness: let us not be high-minded, but fear.



## rabbit hole: glow-worm as poetic subject ##







why are there so many poems about glow-worms? I’ve never seen the glow-worm discussed as a standard poetic subject, but after a certain point everybody seems to write a glow-worm poem. Is it connected to all the walking around in the middle of the night they apparently do?



### Percy Shelley's the Sky-Lark ###







    Like a glow-worm golden



 



        In a dell of dew,



 



      Scattering unbeholden



 



        Its aërial hue



 



Among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view:







#### Shelley's Prometheus Unbound ####







“Look again,—the flames almost



    To a glow-worm’s lamp have dwindled:



The survivors round the embers



    Gather in dread.” (Norton 812)



### Charlotte Smith's the Glow Worm ###







WHEN on some balmy-breathing night of Spring



The happy child, to whom the world is new,



Pursues the evening moth, of mealy wing,



Or from the heath-bell beats the sparkling dew;



He sees before his inexperienced eyes



The brilliant Glow-worm, like a meteor, shine



On the turf-bank;--amazed, and pleased, he cries,



'Star of the dewy grass!--I make thee mine!'--



Then, ere he sleep, collects 'the moisten'd' flower,



And bids soft leaves his glittering prize enfold,



And dreams that Fairy-lamps illume his bower:



Yet with the morning shudders to behold



His lucid treasure, rayless as the dust!



--So turn the world's bright joys to cold and blank disgust. 



#### Charlotte Smith <3 natural history ####







Charlotte Smith is particularly invested in natural history — cf Rural Walks



##### natural history as consolation for world #####







Lisa V’s paper at CSECS: natural history as a consolation when life disappoints you / coping method for the pains of worldly life



### a new trope - natural history? ###







there are no such poems in Middle English



so it is not just night wandering



bc they do that in middle ages



it is not renaissance trope either that I know of -is it not perhaps associated with natural history movements - experiments on tiny creatures, microscopes etc



### chronological connection? ###







they might start to appear around 1800 — Charlotte Smith loves night wandering but doesn’t write about glow-worms until the 6th vol of Elegiac Sonnets



### Grasmere journal ###







“Glowworm Rock”



LOTS of nighttime walks featuring glowworms



Glowworm Rock Still by the side of the old road just north of the junction with the new road at White Moss. ‘We have been in the habit of calling it the Glow-worm Rock from the number of glow-worms we have often seen hanging on to it as described.



### "Proud Maisie" Walter Scott ###







Proud Maisie



Proud Maisie is in the wood



   Walking so early;



Sweet Robin sits on the bush,



   Singing so rarely.







“Tell me, thou bonny bird,



   When shall I marry me?”—



“When six braw gentlemen



   Kirkward shall carry ye.”







“Who makes the bridal bed,



   Birdie, say truly?”—



“The gray-headed sexton



   That delves the grave duly.







“The glowworm o’er grave and stone



   Shall light thee steady;



The owl from the steeple sing,



   ‘Welcome, proud lady.'”







Walter Scott, 1818. Overheard by some characters in The Heart of Midlothian.







### Wordsworth ###







the Glowworm The poem, ‘Among all lovely things my Love had been’, W’s gift to D on his return from seeing Mary in Middleham the previous week; see 20 Apr. 1802 for an account of the poem’s composition on horseback (Calvert’s horse). It is about the finding of a glow-worm for ‘Lucy’ to see. ‘The incident’, wrote W when he copied it out to send to C that same night on reaching Grasmere, ‘took place about seven years ago between Dorothy and me’ (EY, p. 348). The gesture was delicate at Racedown in 1795, and the poem about it is particularly delicate in Apr. 1802; it clearly did reassure D that W’s intended marriage would mean no diminution of his love for her.



### Cowper ###







The Nightingale and the Glow-worm

1. THE GLOW-WORM,



1.



BENEATH the hedge, or near the stream,



A worm is known to stray;



That shews by night a lucid beam,



Which disappears by day.



2.



Disputes have been and still prevail



From whence his rays proceed;



Some give that honour to his tail,



And others to his head.



Page  336



3.



But this is sure—the hand of might



That kindles up the skies,



Gives him a modicum of light,



Proportion'd to his size.



4.



Perhaps indulgent nature meant



By such a lamp bestow'd,



To bid the trav'ler, as he went,



Be careful where he trod:



5.



Nor crush a worm, whose useful light



Might serve, however small,



To shew a stumbling stone by night,



And save him from a fall.



6.



Whate'er she meant, this truth divine



Is legible and plain,



'Tis power almighty bids him shine,



Nor bids him shine in vain.



Page  337



7.



Ye proud and wealthy, let this theme



Teach humbler thoughts to you,



Since such a reptile has its gem,



And boasts its splendour too.







### Ann Radcliffe ###



#### poem in Udolpho ####







There’s a glow-worm poem in Udolpho!!



#### "On the Supernatural in Poetry" ####







“Oh, I should never be weary of dwelling on the perfection of Shakspeare, in his management of every scene connected with that most solemn and mysterious being, which takes such entire possession of the imagination, that we hardly seem conscious we are beings of this world while we contemplate ‘the extravagant and erring spirit.' The spectre departs, accompanied by natural circumstances as touching as those with which he had approached. It is by the strange light of the glow-worm, which ‘'gins to pale his ineffectual fire ;' it is at the first scent of the morning air–the living breath, that the apparition retires. There is, however, no little vexation in seeing the ghost of Hamlet played. The finest imagination is requisite to give the due colouring to such a character on the stage; and yet almost any actor is thought capable of performing it. In the scene where Horatio breaks his secret to Hamlet, Shakspeare, still true to the touch of circumstances, makes the time evening, and marks it by the very words of Hamlet, ‘Good even, sir,' which Hanmer and Warburton changed, without any reason, to ‘good morning,' thus making Horatio relate his most interesting and solemn story by the clear light of the cheerfullest part of the day; when busy sounds are stirring, and the sun itself seems to contradict every doubtful tale, and lessen every feeling of terror. The discord of this must immediately be understood by those who have bowed the willing soul to the poet.””



## pursue: Austen looms over all of this... ##







I sort of — suddenly remembered that she is, like Shakespeare, a monumentally canonized author, and that I am interested in such figures, and that she is in my period — and I got very curious about reading her in relation to Radcliffe, Smith, and Robinson, all of whom were celebrities in the decade before her



### her shadow isn't interesting ###







I’d rather just play around with Smith as Smith, rather than Smith in the shadow of Austen



### Austen & Radcliffe ###







having re-read Radcliffe, I could easily imagine a Radcliffe fandom along the lines of an Austen fandom — Udolpho really is very good



the Radcliffe-Austen connection ought to be pretty well-trod, though; Northanger Abbey is famously a rewriting of Udolpho



Alex: “yes very - but you are not talking about Austen's reading of Radcliffe so much as her reading v. their reading?”



### Austen as 1790s author? ###







it might be interesting, actually, to look just at the juvenilia that was written during my decade of interest



oh, especially her history of england, which is a riot — in conversation with the general problem/project of national history in the shadow of the revolution



## how is Marie Antoinette represented when? ##







Do poems about her in prison take place before she is actually imprisoned, or not?



Does her representation shift in time with her location/status as an actual person, or in time with shifting ideas about the revolution?



## apocalyptic visions ##







How common are these? Is it women writing them? Are they popular? Do people write about them?



“Beachy Head”, “Eighteen Hundred and Eleven”, maybe some Blake?? “Ozymandias”



## Wordsworth's Salisbury Plain? ##







What was it? Any connection to More??







## Palmyra ##



### Barbauld "1811" ###







“In desert solitudes then Tadmor sleeps”



## What were nuns up to? ##







Is there a difference between the actual nuns of the world, and the literary depiction of nuns?



### convents as woman-storage ###







Women “bury themselves” in convents — it’s a living death



(But there’s always this anxiety that they’re not dead enough, that they are too beautiful or too rich to be discarded from consideration)



### women have leisure in convents ###







“I came to learn that women have never had a history or culture of leisure. (Unless you were a nun, one researcher later told me.) That from the dawn of humanity, high status men, removed from the drudge work of life, have enjoyed long, uninterrupted hours of leisure. And in that time, they created art, philosophy, literature, they made scientific discoveries and sank into what psychologists call the peak human experience of flow. Women aren’t expected to flow. I read feminist leisure research (who knew such a thing existed?) and international studies that found women around the globe felt that they didn’t deserve leisure time. It felt too selfish. Instead, they felt they had to earn time to themselves by getting to the end of a very long To Do list. Which, let’s face it, never ends. I began to realise that time is power. That time is a feminist issue.”

### was the bleeding nun a common story? ###



## natural / unnatural family relations ##



### Hannah More ###







The Two Shoemakers: much discussion of “unnatural” family



	•	Part 4: “He was just able to sob out, My unnatural father leaves me to perish, and my injured friend is more than a father to me. Stock told him that one proof he must give him of his repentance was, that he must forgive his father, whose provocation had been very great.” 







### William Hazlitt ###







“This is but natural: it is but natural for a mother to have more regard for her son than for a whole city; but then the city should be left to take some care of itself”. Review of Coriolanus; Norton p 550



## Emily St Aubert has 3 girlfiends ##







The Italian woman, the peasant girl, and then Blanche — and it is Blanche who most fully sees her to happiness



(Can I read something related to Between Women to understand this?)



### she also has 3 boyfriends ###







Morano and the fishing-house stalker seem like basically fine boyfriends — why is Valancourt so superior?



## Is the dislike of "new money"... justified? ##







Broadview p XLV: “To possess a good deal of money as a result not of belonging to the ‘landed gentry’ but rather of having amassed it through commercial activity was considered more than faintly disreputable.” — That commercial activity was probably partly unsavory or exploitative; without a local community to whom one has obligations, greed has full reign



## ending with an ad for next time ##



### Tristram Shandy ###



### Hannah More ###



### William Hazlitt ###







On his first acquaintance with the poets—



“Enough of this for the present. ‘But there is matter for another rhyme, / And I to this may add a second tale.’” (Norton p 564)



### Wordsworth Heart-Leap Well ###







‘But there is matter for another rhyme, / And I to this may add a second tale.’



## Hazlitt on Coleridge on fame ##



### Lewis too popular ###







As per Hazlitt, Norton p 561



“He had been to see the Castle Spectre by Monk Lewis, while at Bristol, and described it very well. He said ‘it fitted the taste of the audience like a glove.’ This ad captandum merit was, however, by no means a recommendation of it, according to the severse principles of the new school, which reject rather than court popular efffect.”



### Thompson appropriately popular ###







Norton p 563, Hazlitt on Coleridge:



“It was in ths room that we found a little worn-out copy of the Seasons, lying in a window seat, on which Coleridge exclaimed, ‘That is true fame!’ He said Thompson was a great poet, rather than a good one; his style was as meretricious as his thoughts were natural. He spoke of Cowper as the best modern poet. He said the Lyrical Ballads were an experiment about to be tried by him and Wordsworth, to see how far the public taste would endure poetry written in a more natural and simple style than had hitherto been attempted, and making use only of such words as had probably been common in the most ordinary language since the days of Henry II.”



## is 1793 copyright a big deal? ##







Can I detect the influence of a change in France’s copyright in 1793? Is it as big a deal as William St Clair suggests?







## Byron and Southey are interesting! ##







Southey is even interesting in the 1790s! Writes a LOT, in a lot of forms, with shifting political allegiances



## pirate press publishes against author's reputation ##







Queen Mab kept in print in pirated editions by radical press, to his embarassment (Norton p 749)



Southey’s radical early writing revived in 1820s to his embarassment by pirate press (Norton, in the bit on Byron’s parody of Southey)



The pirate press prints what sells regardless of whether it’s HOW the authors now want to sell themselves



## add copyright laws & libraries to timeline ##







From William St Clair



## can I reconstruct a month in detail? ##







Track down, e.g., weather, exactly what was published each day, letters and diaries from as many people as possible — how much information can I get on the happenings of a single day?



## gaps: published, archive, corpus ##







“the gaps between “the published” (all literary works in history), “the archive” (the portion of what was published that has been preserved and is now increasingly digitized), and “the corpus” (the segment of the archive selected for a particular research question)” (Katherine Bode)



Also mentioned in pamphlet 11 by stanford lab

### Keats v Hunt ###







On the Grasshopper and Cricket







The poetry of earth is never dead:



When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,



And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run



From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;



That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead



In summer luxury,--he has never done



With his delights; for when tired out with fun



He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.



The poetry of earth is ceasing never:



On a lone winter evening, when the frost



Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills



The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,



And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,



The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.







The above sonnet was written in competition with Leigh Hunt.







### Shelley v Horace Smith ###







Ozymandias



## How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers? ##







How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers???????







I'm currently fascinated / mesmerized by this 1960s song "The Masochism Tango": youtube.com/watch?v=TytGOe…



Like, it's actually a fun kinky song, right? Except for what feels like a few points that go "too far" (I think strategically) and thus safely turn the whole thing into a "joke" (and therefore something that can be said in public)



Especially the bit at 3:20 about cigarette burns; it gets a laugh, but he sings it straight, and I know folks who'd be into that.



It makes me have more sympathy for people who want to argue that some 18thC Gothics are trying to subversively smuggle in radical ideas despite not fully committing to those ideas



even if you have to pretend that you're only kidding or otherwise 'take it back', to simply say certain things outright in the first place can be powerful..



..and the self-censored versions can circulate publicly in order to get into the hands of people who know how to decode them



So now I'm thinking of how the Toronto gay scene (in the 70s?) would use newspaper articles "warning" people away from dirty sinful gay hotspots, using lots and lots of detail in order to let other gay people know where to go and what to do



I dunno how to put all of that together, but it feels important somehow! How can we read between the lines without being paranoid readers?



## but, okay, art can't fix the apocalypse. ##







Tom Lehrer’s chillingly relevant youtube videos about the nuclear threat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frAEmhqdLFs) feel both incredibly powerful and obviously inefficacious. (Here we are again, here we are again..) — I can make connections to the 1790s I’m sure, but what do we do with that?? Saying: “This person saw what was happening, and this is how they coped” — does that mean we should cope that way too?



(I’m also reminded of how often I see people ask “How can I help with X world event?” and how often I see them get the answer “keep talking about it and make sure nobody forgets it’s happening” — attention does not equal solution, but it can FEEL like one. Can we actually learn to do something else?)



### Lehrer on folk songs ###

Also very familiar!



## research methods for corpora comparisons ##







My biggest-scale question is: I have all of these different corpora of stuff from 1789-99. How can I compare what they contain? If people only worked with the absolute easiest corpus to access (ECCO-TCP), what would they be leaving out?







I want to develop a consistent ontology (in the computer science definition of the word) to apply to all of the corpora, so I can directly compare what kinds of materials each includes. It's important for this ontology to be able to tell me things like "this corpus consists entirely of plays" (because one of them definitely does) but I don't know how to know in advance what categories I'll need. (I'm going to ask my mom about this, ontologies are her jam.)







Then I want to look at each individual corpus and classify its contents into my ontology categories. I'll probably do this computationally also, but it's important to me to classify at least some of each corpus by hand, to check (or train?) my computational approach. Since I can't classify 52,000 things by hand (1 minute per thing = 866 hours) I want to take a random sample, classify *that*, and say "the whole thing probably looks roughly like this." I'll probably be classifying just by title / title page so they should all be able to "respond," but if I want to look at how well those titles reflect the actual content I might start bumping up against works that I can't access (and also I'll want to use smaller samples so I can spend longer on each item.)







I'd like to use the smallest sample that is still acceptably trustworthy. I don't know what is considered acceptably trustworthy: 70%? 98%?







I have several corpora -- smallest one 466 items, biggest one 52,000 -- so I am looking for a calculation to run each time I decide to sample a new corpus. (My first instinct was to pick one number and sample that many of each one, but on reflection, that's... not right, is it? Should I sample the same *percentage* of each one?)







I'm basically treating each corpus as a non-random sample of the platonic ideal of "Printed Works In Britain 1789-99" and trying to see how each corpus represents that platonic ideal, and also trying to inch closer to that platonic ideal.



# Observations #



## novels as puzzle-solving practice ##



### Radcliffe vs Austen ###







In Radcliffe you know who the heroine should marry; the mysteries are all cosmetic (though there’s always the slight chance that she will die before the end and someone else will marry the nice gentleman); in Austen, the stories are all high-stakes mysteries that puts the reader in the same shoes as the heroine-investigator as she tries to figure out who is a good person for her to marry.



### Fielding ###







There’s lots of writing on Fielding staging the interpretation of evidence and testimony



## "genres are problem-solving devices" ##







What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (Moretti Distant Reading 141)



## there is no "quintessential" genre example ##







I’ve been looking, but I haven’t been able to find anything that ONLY replicated one genre’s set of tropes without including anything a bit original or incongruous; similarly no one work is able to contain ALL generic tropes. There is no “typical” Gothic novel 



### Genre is like Aristotelian species? ###







Genre operates like Aristotelian species, where we see individual examples and mentally combine them into a created “ideal” or perhaps placeholder? (Does this have… useful implications? Does Cai have anything to say about this?)



### 1820s parody gothics are gothic ###







The second flourishing of the Gothic in the 1820s as parody, meaningfully is Gothic.



### Gothic checklists have no referents ###







Checklists of Gothic tropes functioned as successful pointers, despite the fact that no one work completed all the checklist items.



## what to teach: convo with Jack ##







From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:







1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."







1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.







2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).







2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.







I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.







Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.







So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???



## be true to the variety of the period, but also true to its chief emphasis ##







be true to the variety of the period, but also true to its chief emphasis.



### account for variety with information density ###







Minard is actually making a strong and brutal argument in his chart -- against war, against Napoleon, and against history as the biography of celebrity. I need to do a lot of actual research first, to figure out what I think is true, and why I think it, but I will know that I have succeeded, I think, if I can produce something half so rich and persuasive.







Right now this means that I am throwing out my current dissertation outline, which separates things based on which corpus I am pulling my information from. I will describe my methods in the most voluminous appendices the department has ever seen if I must (and I strongly suspect that, in the end, I must) but I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.







I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.



### computations don't allow generalization ###







One of the things I like about computational methods is that, ultimately, there are no glossy simplifications — one must touch and somehow *account for* the things that don’t fit the pattern



## ESTC: publishers visible over authors ##







The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by “Great Britain”, and dwarfed again by the works by “null” authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.



## ESTC: author development = publisher choice ##







Radcliffe is remarkably stable in her choice of publisher



When Smith begins to branch out into more political radical works, she needs to branch out into new publishers as well



Robinson: ???



More accomplishes her stunning volume of work partly by being a publisher as much as she is an author. (See: The Apprentice’s Monitor) Her shifting publisher data is mostly information on the Cheap Repository Tracts. [But I was cautioned that these dates are less reliable! Ignore chronological information over sheer quantity? This also addresses the other difficulties re: there being too many publishers to show as a timeline]



## ESTC: prominence of the "back catalogue" ##







Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.



## canonical authors aren't obviously exceptional ##







"rivals: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (Moretti Distant Reading 67)



There are so many of them and they look at first glance so similar



They reveal that our canonical authors aren’t inherently exceptional



## always expect power-law distribution ##







“Ha-ha! No one expects the power-law distribution!”



We want things to be a few, simple, balanced categories — we especially want there to be two equally-matched sides of a binary — but in fact just about everything follows a power-law distribution, which will necessitate a long-tail “misc” category.



### "thinking other than dualistically" ###







Sedgwick’s project in Thinking Feeling was “the ambition of thinking other than dualistically” (p.1)



## 18thC titles intentionally signal contents ##







The title of a work was the main ‘advertisement’ available to a text (even author names played a minor role!) so 18thC titles are doing a lot of heavy linguistic signalling of the contents intentionally to locate/interpellate their audiences



## nitpicks ##



### Smith definitely goes to the headland ###







“SONNET LXX. On being cautioned against walking over a headland overlooking the sea, because it was frequented by a Lunatic.” — Not “on cancelling my walk because I’ve been cautioned!”



“In moody sadness, on the giddy brink, / I see him more with envy than with fear;” — why would this not be literally true? (At least as per the poetic premise)



### WW helped with the root ###







It’s buying into Wordsworth’s weird aesthetic fetishization of poverty to say that a poor old man is defined by his struggle with a root and has nothing left after the wandering poet slices it for him. There is another root. There are a lot more roots. There are also clothes to wash and furniture to mend and a thousand, thousand other household labours, which his wife has been doing! If anything, the sadness of his gratitude is that, as the poet knows, cutting one root does nothing to change the actual condition of the man’s life.



## reparative reading ##







"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."



"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



### DH: thing you study is a thing you create ###







You make/remake the object of your inquiry according to your own interests, priorities, lens, whims — you nurture it, claim it, become intimate with it by manipulating it (deformance), using it, getting messy and tangled and confused with it.



The decade 1789-99 is suddenly *about me*, and *mine*.



### readers can get sustenance anywhere ###







*Anything* can become the thing that gets you through; some things might make the attachment easier than others, but the decision to attach lies in the reader, who returns to and re-interprets the text to shape it into the tool required.



**This is the reason that the canon is not useful.**



## edit anthologies in chronological order ##







Okay, but really, what **if** the Norton Anthology presented all the works in chronological order, instead of grouping them by author? 



### de-emphasize The Author ###







You could include author bios at at author's first appearance, but the whole system of biographical readings would break down.. instead, there would have to be running historical contextualization. It would make current ways of teaching inconvenient, but perhaps in productive ways: if you wanted to read a bunch of poems by one author, students would have to skip past the other writing that was produced in between, a tangible reminder of the time that actually did separate those works. It also makes it easier to sub in less "important" authors, when you're looking for a work to fill just one chronological slice rather, than an author whose ouevre will be broadly applicable.



### must decide "when" a work happens ###







Does a work get listed according it its composition? (Beginning of first composition, or end of last revision?) Its first publication? But “publication” doesn’t apply to works that circulated widely in manuscript form — date from the first time a copy was “distributed” to someone other than the author? (What about, e.g., Percy editing Frankenstein? Other manuscript works were surely revised in response to feedback, but Mary giving Percy a copy doesn’t feel like “publication”.)



Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren’t likely to be fully useful. I like first publication to reflect when the work became less inchoate and entered into a broader literary conversation — this is the point at which chronological connections seem most likely to be informative.



### cf Cox's(?) edition of Keats ###







Presented peoms and letters intermingled chronologically



### assumption: time matters more than person ###







A chronological anthology is structured by the assuption that the most important context for a work is not who it is by, but when it was produced. Author comes second. This reverses the traditional anthology (Norton etc), which is structured by the assumption that the most important context for a work is the author who produced it, with chronology as a second concern.



Author is of course an important component! But it can also promote the false idea that changes within an author’s body of work are mostly due to personal matters or artistic evolution, rather than being responses to other works being produced or to changes in the world at large. 



### chronology demands decisions ###







To edit chronologically requires deciding, often at an astonishing level of particularity, exactly when a work first came into being. Almost no work is straightforwardly reducible to a single date, especially if one seeks to capture composition rather than publication: [Smith’s sonnets, Lyrical Ballads, Coleridge — but even Walpole and Lewis whose second editions make a different stir than their first].



#### publication = entry to conversation ####







I argue for organization by publication date over composition only partly because publication is more likely to be feasible. Many works in the period circulated as manuscripts or in private readings before publication (even Austen!) but it is the point of publication which marks an intentional, temporarily-fixed/timely entry into a broader public conversation.



## Wordsworth wrote collaboratively ##



### Coleridge wrote "We Are Seven" ###







“My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus:-'A little child, dear brother Jim,' —I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T —'s name, who was familiarly called Jim.” (WW)







And it’s even an IN JOKE, and he uses the stanza just as Coleridge wrote it, deleting the joke without replacing it with anything!! This is not transcendent inspiration and individual genius. (He had long left behind the mountain and the girl when he wrote; he was thinking about tea time!)







— It is perfectly fine to be thinking about tea time; the poem is still wonderful. But the myth simply doesn’t work.



## lessons learned from the French Revolution ##







ideological purity is impossible and it is dangerous to demand it, perfect rationality is impossible and it is dangerous to ignore emotion or the body when making decisions, tying one’s self or group identity to concrete policies or facts leaves one with no options if those things don’t work or aren’t true… and market capitalism causes a lot of suffering



Alex: “that does not sound like a rabbit hole so much as  - you learning the broader stuff for your field



perfect rationality is a very amusing idea



and one to which literature speaks better than political writing, generally: since literary writers tend not to believe quite so hard”



### no such thing as ideological purity ###







One of the lessons we should probably learn from the French Revolution is that ideological purity is not only unecesseary, it is impossible.



## Gothics provide nourishment for suffering ##







(Search convos with hbbo?)



### "suffer like a heroine" ###







The Udolpho line is infamous, but even knowing it was coming, I had a shudder of satisfaction at reaching it, eager for Emily to indeed suffer like a heroine, nobly and successfully.



### performative vulnerability ###







Grecian Daughter, she-tragedy heroine generally; also Emmeline



#### men are easily manipulated ####







Men are easily manipulated because they position of power makes it unecessary for them to adeptly perceive situations; they have the privilege of not really seeing the suffering they cause



#### women's vulnerability demands intervention ####







Women’s ostentatious vulnerability demands male intervention — if women can manage to be sufficiently vulnerable in front of the right men, they can reach their desired end states



(It creates a vacuum)



#### escapism: performative vulnerability works ####







The escapism of the story is not that men won’t kidnap you — it’s that the only strategy you have available to you (performative vulnerability) will work.



#### “topping from the bottom" ####







performative vulnerability as a woman’s “topping from the bottom” power play — that the distress being expressed is REAL doesn’t make its expression less manipulative; contrast with the Victorian “A Little Princess” idea of suffering only inwardly



### conviction powerful; preposession dangerous ###







Conviction in the face of oppression is powerful, if you refuse to believe the tyrants they can never truly conquer you ----- but also preposessions make rationality impossible and hurt society







(Women in Gothic novels know the tyranny of patriarchy is unjust, and by suffering without ever conceding to it, they triumph)

#### Harley's experience at Bedlam is odd ####







Harley's encounter at Bedlam, in general, relates to the rest of the work in unexpected ways. The encounter itself is exactly the kind of thing I expected from a book titled Man of Feeling: Harley is uninterested in his friends' fashionable entertainments, but agrees to go along on a tour of the Bedlam asylum (which was, uh, a common place to tour for amusement); at the asylum, he sees a beautiful and ladylike woman with a tragic backstory that has induced in her a whimsical and nonthreatening sort of madness; this sets her apart from the other, repulsive inmates of the asylum, and Harley is moved to effusive tears at her distress. His tears inspire pity in his friends and their tour guide as well, opening their eyes to new frontiers of sympathetic feeling, and the madwoman gives him a memento to remember her by.



Then he leaves and never mentions her again. And I found myself noticing that his character trait of "feeling" was fairly sudden. A lot of book happens before our protagonist leads us in a round of tears!



[Are the other parts of the novel meant to demonstrate “feeling” also? Because they really just look like naievete.]



## Venice Preserv'd / Grecian Daughter ##



### two ways of looking at a heroine ###







Belvidera: emotional connection



Euphrasia: plot effectiveness



Shifts within she-tragedy?



### the "zone of death" ###







It’s Renault!!!



### Moretti's "control" research authorizes innovation ###







If Moretti hadn’t shown that social networks accurately identify Hamlet as a protagonist, we couldn’t use that method to hunt down protagonists in more ambiguous plays



### audience as member of node ###







Asides and soliloquies interpellate the author into having a sympathetic connection with some characters over others — the role of the audience in the social network can be informative regarding the play’s overall sympathies



## literary celebrity can inhibit legacy ##







I… think I am actually interested in the role of “celebrity” as related to authors, and the observation that too much / the wrong kind of celebrity during an author’s lifetime counteracts the potential for long-lasting literary fame



though, Radcliffe was also like Austen quite reclusive and resistant to the “celebrity author” role, even after she achieved financial literary success



but, that just meant that salacious stories of her Gothic madness & death circulated unchallenged after she stopped writing and scholars are still trying to figure out what really did happen to her



hmm-- it ties into my general interest of trying to pick my way through my decade of choice, trying on a range of different metrics for “important” and then paying attention to the bodies of texts that come forward as “important” for each metric



and my diss authors (other than Radcliffe) are all attempting to use and cultivate literary fame as one of the ends of their writing



(well, even Radcliffe is cultivating fame, but with less directly political ends)



I picked authors who wrote prolifically in a range of mediums and genres because I am interested in the emerging “reading public” and what it looked like in the 1790s when all that writing and reading got very high-stakes



## chapter: ballads in More & WW ##



### long history of using songs to be popular ###







I've been thinking a lot about songs. As far as I can tell, in the 1820s, poets have been boldly revitalizing poetry by publishing edited versions of popular songs for at least fifty years.







The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects. But, seeing Wordsworth and Coleridge as participants in a literary conversation also makes them more interesting again, so I can forgive them their propaganda and just focus on how interesting it is that Wordsworth's 1798 "The Thorn" has so much in common with Hannah More's 1796 "Ballad of Robert and Richard" (both of them are trying to 'elevate' ghost stories above vulgar superstition, for the improvement of their audiences, but with completely different ideas as to what that entails).







The second part of "thinking a lot about songs" involves a leap of several hundred years: Jo Walton is a Hugo- and Nebula-winning writer, and she says that "the single most quoted thing I have ever written" is... a limerick she posted in a usenet newsgroup in 1998, "The Lurkers Support Me In Email," to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over the Ocean.” I wouldn't be remotely surprised to find that Hannah More has also written a morally-improving ballad to that tune (or, if she hasn't, it's only because the song is too associated with Jacobins), and certainly her other songs all mention specific tunes which she assumes I will already know.







So there's something interesting to me, here, about the idea of layering your words over top of pattern someone else already knows, as a way to get your version to stick more easily in people's heads. I don't think Jo Walton was intentionally trying to write something extremely memorable, but Hannah More certainly was.



#### novels mention but don't always show ballads ####







The poetry certainly circulated outside its novelistic content -- in the case of Udolpho, two of the main character's poems were actually published separately in periodicals beforethe novel. But the songs and poems included in novels seem to be there in part to "elevate" and grant respectability to the fiction -- Udolpho mentions a ballad, but doesn't print it. So perhaps the somewhat disreputable nature of popular ballads could be tempered by literary or moral intervention, but only when that was the only literary project going.







But Waverley includes a lot of ballads!



##### did people sing these songs? #####







I'm curious, too, about the afterlives of the songs that often appear in the novels of the decade. Did people actually sing them?



#### ballads make ideas catchy ####







Jo Walton’s “single most quoted thing I have ever written” is a song “The Lurkers Support Me In Email” to the tune of “My Bonny Lies Over The Ocean” — because the tune makes the words more memorable, so if the idea itself sticks with you you now have a pre-packaged way to share it



JUST LIKE what Hannah More does when she publishes hymns / the entire song market of the 18thC!! 



#### Captive's aferlife as Victorian ballad ####







http://siderealpressblog.blogspot.ca/2012/05/maniac-captive-and-monk-my-good-friend.html



### Wordsworth & More ###







let’s see, looking though my notes — looks like William Wordsworth writes a ton of poems that are just incredibly pretentious versions of Hannah More’s stories/ballads



Alex: “has that been said before. god I hate wordsworth



such a mansplainer



so that would be a great topic”



Michael Gamer has said, essentially, that Wordsworth is writing more pretentious versions of popular ghost stories



Alex: “proving that he is one of those dudes in a meeting who repeats what the woman said but louder



but no one Hannah More especially?”



no, Hannah More hates ghost stories for the same reason Wordsworth does — they are vulgar and unchristian



but she uses them anyway, the same way wordsworth does



to subvert them into morally improving tales



or, well, WW is less clear w/ moral improvement of individual poems



but Gamer makes a compelling argument re: his overall claim to have “elevated” his material



Alex: “is there room to argue against Gamer, or to move it in another direction then?”



I don’t know that More is a specific source for Wordsworth; it’s not impossible, but also not immediately likely to me. What interests me is the similarity of their rhetorical stance toward their material and their shared mission of “elevating” for moral improvement, contrasted with their success — Wordsworth has got everybody buying his propaganda, More not so much



Alex: “well, he is a dude.......



but I see the question, and how it relates to the question about 1790s you have formulated...



certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business.”



hmmm.. Gamer is mostly making a broader argument about the Gothic as the immediate source for Romanticism, whereas More is essentially orthogonal to Romanticism…



(I agree with & really like Gamer’s argument about the Gothic & Romanticism)



More want to repurpose and “elevate” the Gothic for essentially evangelical Christian ends — it is astonishing how much I like her, really, given that she is the perfect precursor to all those meddling Victorian moralist middle-class ladies



Alex: “right, but you are still seeing something new there, about More, that both fits in with an is distinct from Gamer - and is core to your questions about your period”



yeah, I think I would use Gamer as a leaping-off point to pursue this slightly separate track, about other attempts to elevate/repurpose popular writing



Alex: “sounds chapter-able. very good.”



#### "The Thorn" & "Ballad of Robert & Richard" ####







Both ballad poems are using the same idea of an abandoned woman and the horrors of death, but in different ways; both are trying to re-purpose an existing cultural phenomenon/trope while filing off the parts they find distateful to serve their more morally uplifting purposes



#### When WW makes ballad lyrical he is gross ####







More writes ballads about and for the people she discusses



When Wordsworth makes them LYRICAL ballads he turns the poor into spectacles / objects of pity; he subordinates their lived experience to his intellectual/poetic/aesthetic experience



## many works not actual one single object ##



### Elegiac Sonnets written over time ###







I am not sure what I now know about Charlotte Smith that I didn't before, but I feel like I know something. Mostly, I think, spreading all these poems out in my timeline helps to clarify that Elegiac Sonnets (like Tristram Shandy!) is not actually a single unified work representing one moment of time, but rather an assemblage that can react to the events it shapes. The re-introduction of chronological gaps makes it easier to identify where she is developing her thoughts or changing her mind, and highlights the trial-and-error of her experiments as sets of poems are entered into the record.



### Alfoxden & Grasmere mingled with much ###







“She… now had at handa book of 3 years before, still with many empty pages; thus, on 14 Feb, when she needed another book for the Grasmere Journal, she filled this, leaving 1 blank page, and writing on until 2 May 1801 when she met the fragment of W’s essay on moralists coming from the other end.”



Why do we treat “the Grasmere Journal” as a distinct text with a title and clear bounds??? I’m not convinced that it is actually A Thing.



### Tristram Shandy written over time ###







Whole other books came out in between volumes!! 



His Gothic moments begin to appear after Otranto



Are there differences between volumes that were printed at the same time (eg vol 1 and 2) vs vols with gaps (eg vol 2 and 3)?



### parts of major works circulate seperately ###



#### Wordsworth's Prelude ####







What parts were printed elsewhere, and where?



(What parts were read to people, and when??)



How much was the work anticipated, when it was published on his death?



#### Radcliffe's poems ####



## 1790s demand timeliness from literature ##







The need for speed in composition & publishing affects more than just political pamphlets, introduces a responsiveness to literature, has effects even in somewhat unexpected places



## Romantic poets relied upon women ##







In their own acknowledgement (?), from the beginning, the poet’s occupation and their romantic connection with nature rely upon the support of the women in their lives; certainly Coleridge knew the importance of Dorothy to Wordsworth, and surely knowing of her would have been key to being “in the know” in their whole social circle; effacing these women’s importance wasn’t key to the myth-making yet (?) but was something grabbed ahold of and exaggerated later?



### Wordsworth ###







Tintern Abbey and The Prelude refer directly to Dorothy’s presence, importance, and role in shaping his mind/career







Wordsworth also published some of Dorothy’s poems as “by a female friend” -- how many people knew they were hers?



### Coleridge ###







Coleridge: “Frost at Midnight” : For still I hoped to see the stranger's face, / Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved, / My play-mate when we both were clothed alike! — His sister stands out from other people and relatives as the most desirable possible arrival



## Coleridge misdiagnoses his nightmares ##







See the Norton: he was probably going through opium withdrawal, but the morality of supernaturalism made him misdiagnose bad dreams as symptoms of deep guilt



## debt vs credit ##







It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit



It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing to promise repayment) and then 80% of the time we’re told that he did follow up and repay



Are the screeds against debt in the same works...? I’ll have to check, but I THINK there’s a distinction being made between “credit” (which is tied to social credibility) and “debt” (which is seen as impersonal and with near-mystical properties)



Similarly peasants can live like 5 years in a cottage without paying rent and they’ll get around to it when the landlord asks them, and this too is not “debt”, in fact at the start of the century it’s a narrative marker of cruelty for the landlord to insist on the rent being paid



Ok, those are my thoughts on credit vs debt as part of the shift from parochial economies to imperial market capitalism



### Hannah More HATES DEBT ###







Debt can even be a sin



## imagining London as a future ruin ##



### Barbauld "1811", 1812 ###







The comfort, in Barbauld’s imagining, is that the ruined buildings will still be imaginatively occupied by a veritable flood of still-remembered named individuals who constitute a national legacy; a much more soothing image than Smith’s, in which the buildings are unreadable







Memoralizing, too, is cyclical: “And now, where Caesar saw with proud disdain / The wattled hut and skin of azure stain, / Corinthian columns rear their graceful forms, / And light varandas brave the wintry storms, / While British tongues the fading fame prolong / Of Tully's eloquence and Maro's song.”







Perhaps, she says, long ages past away, 



And set in western waves our closing day, {120} 



Night, Gothic night, again may shade the plains 



Where Power is seated, and where Science reigns; 



England, the seat of arts, be only known 



By the gray ruin and the mouldering stone; 



That Time may tear the garland from her brow, {125} 



And Europe sit in dust, as Asia now. 



   Yet then the ingenuous youth whom Fancy fires 



With pictured glories of illustrious sires, 



With duteous zeal their pilgrimage shall take 



From the blue mountains, or Ontario's lake, {130} 



With fond adoring steps to press the sod 



By statesmen, sages, poets, heroes trod







…







  But who their mingled feelings shall pursue 



When London's faded glories rise to view? 



The mighty city, which by every road, 



In floods of people poured itself abroad; {160} 



Ungirt by walls, irregularly great, 



No jealous drawbridge, and no closing gate; 



Whose merchants (such the state which commerce brings) 



Sent forth their mandates to dependant kings; 



Streets, where the turban'd Moslem, bearded Jew, {165} 



And woolly Afric, met the brown Hindu; 



Where through each vein spontaneous plenty flowed, 



Where Wealth enjoyed, and Charity bestowed. 



Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet 



Each splendid square, and still, untrodden street; {170} 



Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time, 



The broken stair with perilous step shall climb, 



Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round, 



By scattered hamlets trace its antient bound, 



And, choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey {175} 



Through reeds and sedge pursue his idle way. 



  With throbbing bosoms shall the wanderers tread 



The hallowed mansions of the silent dead, 



Shall enter the long isle and vaulted dome 



Where Genius and where Valour find a home; {180} 



Awe-struck, midst chill sepulchral marbles breathe, 



Where all above is still, as all beneath; 



Bend at each antique shrine, and frequent turn 



To clasp with fond delight some sculptured urn, 



The ponderous mass of Johnson's form to greet, {185} 



Or breathe the prayer at Howard's sainted feet. 







…







Oft shall the strangers turn their eager feet {205} 



The rich remains of antient art to greet, 



The pictured walls with critic eye explore, 



And Reynolds be what Raphael was before. 



On spoils from every clime their eyes shall gaze, 



Egyptian granites and the Etruscan vase; {210} 



And when midst fallen London, they survey 



The stone where Alexander's ashes lay, 



Shall own with humbled pride the lesson just 



By Time's slow finger written in the dust. 



### Horace Smith, "Ozymandias", 1818 ###







 IN Egypt's sandy silence, all alone, 



      Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws 



      The only shadow that the Desart knows:— 



    "I am great OZYMANDIAS," saith the stone, 



      "The King of Kings; this mighty City shows 



    "The wonders of my hand."— The City's gone,— 



      Nought but the Leg remaining to disclose 



    The site of this forgotten Babylon.







    We wonder,—and some Hunter may express 



    Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness 



      Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace, 



    He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess 



      What powerful but unrecorded race 



      Once dwelt in that annihilated place.

## writing to each other is like Della Cruscans ##







The incestuous Romantic poets writing to each other all the time is a translation of the Della Cruscans; Mary Robinson participates in both conversations



## critics are right: Gothics make you anxious ##







The reading experience of “living with” Udolpho is so different from “living with” Tristram or Waverley; the naysayers aren’t wrong about the emotional impact of the narrative, and really the think Waverley does with the Gothic isn’t making it respectable but defanging it. (Or perhaps, defanging it is what makes it respectable? Intellectual distance now instead of emotional and personal impact?)

This is REALLY firmly believed, not just by characters but implicit in narrative structures — why? Why is a prior attachment given such weight? Why can’t someone be rejected for themself??

## TEI play parser ##







The parser uses stage directions to break the play into ‘blocks’. Each block represents a section of the play during which a set of characters are on stage together. Whenever the parser encounters a stage direction, it parses that direction to determine whether it includes a character entrance or exit and thus demarcates a new block. Within each block, the parser uses speaker tags and parsed stage directions to determine who is on stage for that block, and keeps a running tally of how many words each character has spoken. At the end of the block, the connections within that block are recorded and the next block begun.

Algee-Hewitt, Mark. “Acts of Aesthetics: Publishing as Recursive Agency in the Long Eighteenth Century.” Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net 57-8 (2010). Web. 



Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts. Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.

Clery, E.J. The Rise of Supernatural Fiction 1762-1800. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995. Print. 



Clery tracks the rise of supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news, producing a history of the Gothic that is sensitive to its impact in varying literary contexts. Clery thus provides a model for accounting for the movement of ideas between generic forms, and touches upon many of the key incidents and texts of interest to the first half of my inquiry.



## Frow, John. Genre ##







Frow, John. Genre. New York: Routledge, 2015. Print.



John Frow articulates genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.



## Gamer, Michael. Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception ##







Gamer, Michael. Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2000. Print. 



Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.

This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expand- ing audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3

This collection of essays recaptures the development in Moretti’s career of his theories of literary history as evolutionary and as an imbalanced center-periphery system of exchange, alongside his increasing use of computational methods that come to be known as ‘distant reading.’ Moretti’s interest in accounting for the “great unread” of literature, and his use of computational models to carry out comparative research, provides much of the theoretical background for my own methods.

O’Quinn, Daniel. “Half-History, or The Function of Cato at the Present Time.” Georgian Theatre in an Information Age: Media, Performance, Sociability, special issue of Eighteenth-Century Fiction 27.3-4 (2015). Project Muse. Web. 



O’Quinn discusses three particular performances of Joseph Addison’s Cato (1713) and a famous 1812 portrait of John Philip Kemble in the role of Cato, in order to compare each production’s allegory of George III’s political position and to make a broader argument about the use of partially forgetting the past when re-staging history. O’Quinn’s article, like the majority of those in this special issue of Eighteenth-Century Fiction, thus models the examination of literary work in context with its moment and with other forms of artistic production

p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017







p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017







p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017







p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017







p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017







p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017







p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017







p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics.

“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)



“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)



“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and tht there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels."

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.



What do you think?



(via fanhackers)



“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!



I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.



Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

“Kirwan praises Ward Elliot and Robert Valenza’s “call for acknowledgement of uncertainty (a productive agnosticism rather than a reactionary atheism or unquestioning faith),” concluding the section with the dictum that “critics should be as willing to lose Shakespeare as to find him””



“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””



“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha. In so doing, Kirwan proposes to continue destabilizing the monolithic “Shakespeare,” a project he traces back two decades.”



“a startlingly diffuse, unexpectedly consistent corpus of plays linked by company ownership, rather than by what he argues is the anachronism of authorial ownership.



Motivated to trouble “post-Romantic ideals of individual authorship””



“Boldly, he offers agnosticism to replace the “did-didn’t binary.” This yields “the possibility of Shakespeare’s contribution” to Locrine (137) or a proposed differentiation between “Shakespearean” and “by Shakespeare” (161). This third chapter may inflame more controversy than anything else in the book.”



“the field of attribution studies desperately needs critical metacognitive appraisals of its methods, its successes, and its failures. Kirwan’s assessment of and engagement with attribution studies ought to be cited for years to come”



“Having proven the constructedness of “Canon” and “Apocrypha,” having demonstrated the viability of collaboratively created drama, and having questioned the use and availability of “certain” attributions, Kirwan performs his crowning disruption—to “redefine the meanings of both ‘Shakespeare’ and ‘complete’ in a bid to offer multiple configurations of canon” (205). Here and throughout, Kirwan affirms canons, not a Canon.”



“Kirwan’s final chapter models alternative canon-writing practices as evidence of the potentiality of multivalent canons “to provide options instead of answers” dependent upon audiences’ critical participation”

### Alan Liu, _Wordsworth: The Sense of History_: this ###







Alan Liu, _Wordsworth: The Sense of History_: this is an extraordinary, although quite difficult book. On its surface, it's a New Historicist account of Wordsworth's poetry. However, I've learned more about aesthetics in general from this book than from most other Romanticist criticism. (For one of many, many examples in this book, see Liu's brilliant discussion of "atmosphere" in landscape painting and poetry from essentially the Middle Ages to Wordsworth in his chapter on Wordsworth and the picturesque--in a few brief pages, one gets an incredibly helpful art history account that also illuminates Wordsworth's poetry)



### Timothy Morton, _Shelley and the Revolution in Taste ###







Timothy Morton, _Shelley and the Revolution in Taste: The Body and the Natural World_: a deconstructive/Zizekian-ideology-critique account of P. B. Shelley's poetry--really smart stuff, and an engaging style. (Morton has since gone on to become a major figure in ecocriticism)

## Special Fields list rationale ##







Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’



## Thesis Proposal ##



### background ###







This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.



### driving research Qs ###







My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.



### critical context ###







This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. 



### methods ###



#### model 1: ESTC ####







The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 



I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.



#### model 2: ECCO-TCP ####







I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.



#### model 3: reading ####







Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.



### conclusion ###







Although I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will research them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be said to be “representative” of this decade? And what do they “represent”?

## OGS Plan of Study ##







A recent article by Bode exemplifies a current shift in approaches to digitally-enhanced literary scholarship. Bode builds a critique of “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as complete and objective, Bode argues, it is not different from New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.







I have narrowed my scope to an eleven-year “decade,” keyed to the French Revolution, to make my inquiry feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 works published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.







To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading and corpus stylistics, but I will marry these to bibliographic textual studies and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired bibliographic records for 51,965 works listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewhere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, enabling more detailed computational exploration of their subject matter. 







I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically and influentially during the 1790s, but are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon.







The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and will recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.

### MY POSITION ###



#### 2 ideas: feeling & timeliness ####







Reading Feeling, Writing Timeliness:



Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature



To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two contentious elements of literature, the complex and variable interrelationship of which my study foregrounds, are feeling and timeliness. Both concepts shape eighteenth century writing, and my approach to it. “Feeling” as a central idea refers both to the literature of sensibility as an evolving counterpoint to enlightenment rationalism, and to contemporary processes of reparative reading which foreground the limits of scholarly critique. “Timeliness” encompasses both the urgent responses of the eighteenth century mediascape to a perceived historical rupture, and to an exhaustively particular methodology of historicized textual study. Although my project remains quantitative and computational in its technological foundations, my central interest remains with the field of eighteenth century studies, rather than the field of the digital humanities.



#### feeling ####



##### 18thC feeling #####







Reading Feeling



My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional response, is this a healthy form of exercise for its audience’s moral feeling, or a weakening distraction from real moral action? These questions, in translated form, continue to shape my own questions about literature as a field: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor the importance of feeling without being misled by emotional manipulation?



The “major” works across the period are characterized by sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. My interest in the gothic and the supernatural is thus subsumed within a larger conversation about the representation of feeling. As Clery, Miles, and Gamer have explored in different ways, gothic and supernatural stories encompass a subset of literary strategies to understand and use feeling, which exist in conversation and competition with other strategies. Each work must strike its own balance between exciting the feelings of its readers, and moderating them. The simplest narrative tracing this development begins with a naive emotional philosophy of benevolence in sentimental novels, which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature.



##### Sedgwick #####







Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: “The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one’s findings: “What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.” The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. 



##### Felski #####







Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices. Its extended discussion (and, at points, critique) of the practice of critique highlights similarities between conversations about reading in the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries. For example, when Felski hyperbolically lists the “unserious” reading practices which are presumed to be the only alternative to critique, “naive reading, sentimental effusion, impressionistic judgment, fuzzy-headed amateurism, and mere ‘chatter about Shelley’,” sentimentality is explicitly named alongside forms of ‘sloppy’ thinking that are presumed to be incompatible with rationality. The need to maintain rationality in the face of emotion takes on moral implications in Felski’s hyperbole as well: without critique, the question goes, “what will save us from perdition, what will keep us from committing all those sins we’ve been warned against,” what will keep us from being dangerously bad readers? Of course, part of Felski’s conclusion is that these forms of “bad reading” are not, despite their emotional contamination, morally wrong or intellectual vacuous — but like Sedgwick, she sketches her alternative lightly.



##### closeness / interest #####







Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistance. Felski describes this as “a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance -- a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments.” As a scholarly practice to demonstrate this closeness, Felski gestures towards what she terms “neophenomenology,” “a sustained attention to the sheer range and complexity of aesthetic experiences, including moments of recognition, enchantment, shock, and knowledge.” Felski has begun this work by establishing a greater richness for the vocabulary of “identifying” with characters. Determining whether a character is “relatable” enough to “identify with” is often a key concern for undergraduate readers and for 18thC thinkers: Felski distinguishes literary itentification into at least three types, “structural or formal alignment, moral allegiance, and emotional empathy,” which could be useful for untangling the allegiance required of different works of sentimental literature. Felski thus begins to locate “post-critical, rather than uncritical” forms of “serious thinking” which could both shed light on and be modified by eighteenth-century practices.



#### reparative > timeliness transition ####







The goal of this serious thinking, for Felski, is to remind us “that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized” — a discovery which will “shock” us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite to understant that future ways of life will also be organized differently. For Sedgwick, too, the possibility of “surprise” in a non-paranoid reading, the idea that even the most predictable past events could have unfolded differently, is crucial for imagining change in the future. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing aftershocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that “our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices” are not universal and invulnerable. Robert Miles is one of many to describe the impact of the French Revolution as centred less on individual events, and more on the alarming “historical rupture” which the revolution was seen to constitute. For many, this rupture represented an opportunity for optimism — but many more experienced the turmoil as near-apocalyptic, and even for optimists the sense of impending change was often uncomfortable. Miles argues that a widespread sense of profound change shaped far more than just political thought: “The sense of crisis … linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.” One way that these works were shaped by their context is a heightened sense of timeliness for published works.

Writing Timeliness



Whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand, texts take on shifting meanings as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and recontextualized over time. The changing impact of works over time is most obvious in overtly political works like Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, whose relationship with, for example, Helen Maria Williams’ Letters from France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men was directly determined by the extent to which the works in question were considered to have been borne out by political events. But time-sensitive readings, and an expected textual responsiveness for current events, extended to to literary works as well.



Novels which, in scholarly editions, give the illusion of being singular, unified objects are nearly all the result of a more complicated and responsive process of coming into being. As Tristram Shandy was composed and published, for example, each new installment slightly shifted its emphasis, so that the emerging narrative only gradually solidified into what are, in retrospect, its major concerns. Particularly notable is the way that volumes 7 through 9 of Tristram Shandy, written after the publication of The Castle of Otranto, incorporate Gothic materials differently than the earlier volumes; rather than being one text with one interpretation of the role of the supernatural in heightening readerly emotion, Shandy was a phenomenon which unfolded and varied over time. Even works which were not printed in installments, like Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and Walter Scott’s Waverley, could change in content and in popular reception with a new edition.



Similarly, Lyrical Ballads is often studied in the context of its 1798, 1800, and 1802 editions, but William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge seem to have been following standard poetic practice by writing new prefaces, selecting new poems, and re-editing their works for a new emphasis. Charlotte Smith enacts similar changes across the dozen editions of Elegiac Sonnets printed between 1784 and 1812. Smith’s 1797 edition, for example, includes a new preface, re-selects the non-sonnet poems, and adds new sonnets to create a “new” work out of poems which were as many as thirteen years old. The edition presents her as a politically engaged poet, directly relevant to the events of her day, whose radical philosophies are salient even in her earliest sonnets.



##### bibliographers #####







My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair’s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer’s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the “parade of authors” and “parliament of texts” models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the “footprint” left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski’s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “resonance,” which takes Brewer’s “footprint” as the primary object of study to trace the “busy afterlife of the literary artifact” which “refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.” This “busy afterlife” can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work’s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. 



##### combine in Goldsmith #####







A particularly interesting text which might reward a study of both its timeliness and its use of feeling is Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, which was first published in 1766 but continued to be frequently reprinted in the 1790s. The persistence of Wakefield immediately undermines any literary history which wholly relegates the sentimental novel to the 1760s and 1770s. However, by the 1790s Wakefield is no longer competing with The Man of Feeling (which many of its former dedicated readers now regarded with embarassment), and instead was read alongside the contemporary literature of sensibility in the Gothic mode. There is much still to be uncovered about how readers in the 1790s made very different sense of this work’s political and religious sermons, dramatic and moving prison scenes, and moralizing love-plot.

The Digital Humanities



Timeliness and feeling, as investigated through bibliographical research and reparative reading, thus chart a tangled network of interrelated concepts. Reparative reading requires an openess to the multiplicity of meaning which works may accrue as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and adapated in response to the pressures of timeliness. Precise bibliographical research can recapture and contextualize the complex and variable strategies of feeling that competed throughout the period. Not yet integrated into this set of priorities and methodological frameworks is the element of my project which often requires the most justification: my use of quantitative and computational methodologies.



##### DH as historical breach #####







“Digital humanities” is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke’s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified “digital humanities” work.



##### McCarty: interdisciplinary #####







Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that “[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation”: the current state of “digital humanities” research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to “hard sciences.” The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables — an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti — is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,” it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy — a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.







### stray ideas ###







Its priorities are tantalizingly attuned to those of the literature of sensibility itself.



#### complicate the arc ####







In its broadest strokes, this narrative is probably mostly true, and can certainly be useful. Nonetheless, I wish to complicate it by seeking to reconcile “major” works with their “minor” peers, and by foregrounding what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. My interest in noncanonical works stems from a desire to recognize the real variety of responses expressed throughout the period in question. Even when one literary affective mode is at its peak popularity, other opinions are being expressed and other tools are being employed. [Just because an idea doesn’t “win” its year doesn’t make it uninteresting; rather, the opposite.] Moreover, individual authors evolve in opinion over time, and even individuals works change in meaning over time, hence my interest in timeliness.



#### conclusion ####







I hope to integrate my computational and quantitative research into a fully humanities project by largely refusing to centre the technological elements of my methodology, either in terms of its practice or in terms of its theory. I completely reject the aura of empiricist objectivity which quantitative and computational methods attempt to surround themselves with. I embrace the messiness and intimacy of modelling. Trying to integrate attentiveness to textual detail and emotional openness will be good for “DH.”



#### position attempt 1 ####







My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. The “major” works across the period develop from sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. I want to pose the same questions as the authors themselves: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor one’s feelings without being misled by them? In pursuit of this answer, my reading has led me to a subject matter, a methodology, and an affective stance.



I remain committed, for my subject matter, to the 1790s as an incredibly dense period of complex literary production shaped by what Robert Miles identifies as an apocalyptic political rupture.



The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change. For example, there is a narrative about a naive emotional philosophy in sentimental novels (benevolence), which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature. Perhaps, at its broadest level, this narrative is true or useful, but there are many more ways in which it is false.



One way which I seek to be more accurate is by paying close attention to what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. So, for example, I am interested in Burke’s Reflections as a text which is outcompeted by Williams when it is first published, and attracts a flood of negative responses, but which slowly outcompetes the others and becomes more successful over time as it gains credit for its prescience.



As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one.



My interest in the gothic is thus subsumed within my interest in 18thC strategies of feeling generally; gothic fear and supernatural imagination both represent strategies which are in conversation (and competition) with other strategies, which I also want to integrate.







#### exhaustive particularity ####







As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one; I think exhaustive particularty might be my way out.



##### DH #####







(1a) I am excited about the ways that distant reading allows the consideration of more works, and thus an expansion of the works under discussion.  I’ll probably make a database trying to combine all the stuff I have, and definitely make a lot of artisanal hand-crafted “small data.



(1b) I am also excited about the recursive reflective process of modelling: the usefulness of making one’s models and their parameters explicit and testing multiple models; the need to actually meaningfully *account for* the full variety of what one is working with, to grapple with and reconcile outliers.”



My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline.



Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all” (McCarty). These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.



“The range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation.” … “Between these two is what seems to me the ideal – a combination, not compromise, of centrifugal freedom and centripetal beholdenness.” (McCarty) 



“digital humanities offers a middle ground or conjectural space within which, data being simply data, the objects of study dear to the humanities may be treated temporarily as if they were objects of nature, like rocks or stars, then the results of that treatment juxtaposed to how we see them and questions asked.” (McCarty)



#### intro ####







I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.



I’m interested in strategies of feeling as an ethical concern which lives on today with discussions of reparative reading, and I’m interested in textual timeliness as subject matter that can shed light on the individuality of text’s strategies of feelings through bibliographical and computational research.



My thinking has led me to a methodology, a subject matter, and a philosophical/emotional stance.



The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change.



### guidelines ###







--- remember this process is unsatisfying inherently. choose like 3/100 ideas, and explain them well in your position paper; the rest will emerge at the oral



--- I really mean - 3/100. The worst that can happen for someone like you is you get lost in the trees, can't see the wood, etc. Simplify it down



--- more like a manifesto than a thesis proposal



--- it should be an exploration of ideas though, not a 'here is a list of the ideas I will explore and in this structure'



--- it's something like - I read all this, i learned all this, i care about THIS THIS AND THIS (just 3 things, out of 100!) - here is how I want to move forward



— your question is -what do i think my investment in this field is. what do I want to spend 2-3 years writing about



### pick exactly three big ideas ###



#### more bibliographical than "DH" ####







My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline. I pursue answers to literary questions via a range of methods, some of which will employ databases, [other things]. However, [rather than focusing on the digitality of my tools], I emphasize the continuity of my approach with, for example, the exhaustive descriptive bibliography of Garside and the empirical quantificaion of St Clair.



##### no longer considering scales as different models #####







My initial thesis proposal proposed approaching my decade of interest by examining three different “models” of different levels of detail: “One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.”



I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.



##### Felski: I want to avoid critique #####







One line of thinking which attempts to sidestep critique is to consider the throughlines of Gothic fiction as providing nourishment for suffering [suffer like a heroine, performative vulnerability, 



#### still want to "account for" everything ####



#### seriousness?? ####







All of these works can be hard to take seriously..



#### false empiricism only affects humanists ####







Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, research in other fields is hard even to identify *as* research. These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.



#### works I love ####







Works I love: Vicar of Wakefield, A Simple Story, Percy?, Old Manor House, Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, some of Coleridge, so much of Keats, Radcliffe 4 eva, UNCLE TOBY, ode on the death of a favourite cat, 1811, Charlotte Smith, Cowper!!, 



Mostly I don’t like… men? But Keats and Gray and Cowper and Sterne and Walpole and Lewis are all ok?



##### authors #####







My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.



I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” 



##### More vs Wordsworth #####







A central tension for me is the sense that Hannah More and William Wordsworth are both falling into similar traps of aestheticizing and moralizing their disdain for the very real distress for those in poverty, and that I nonetheless find Shepherd of Salisbury Plain more palatable than Michael. Michael in its beauties disguises its operations; More is so transparent that it’s easy to simply set aside what is unpalatable and read for the other details.



 



##### works with useful lessons?? #####



#### possible chapters ####







My reading has allowed me to develop more specific hypotheses regarding potential chapters. 







are all my chapters going to be “compare two authors and how they use one genre”?



are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?



if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format (though I could add people who wrote plays!!)



and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?



or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More & Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”



and that’s the one where I talk about my emerging theory of timeliness



or is timeliness not a chapter, but in fact the overarching theme of the whole diss?



##### timeliness #####



##### More & Wordsworth & ballads #####







One potential chapter, for example, might examine Hannah More and William Wordsworth’s varying use of supernatural content and ballad forms as literary tools to “elevate” their readers. This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.



#### reparative reading ####







I want to both do reparative reading and examine how 18thC audiences might have read reparatively.



I look at literature as something that is always ephemeral and timely, always in a moment that has the potential to be momentous — a play and a song and a novel all have their own ways of occupying the lives of their audiences.



Uses and practices around / with texts



Texts as trying to encourage particular uses, reaching out to particular readers —but not able to control those uses (seriousness always on the verge of parody)



##### trying to take advice from the texts themselves #####







The 18thC debate about the appropriate uses of feeling, its contradictions with rational philosophy but also its necessity, is — what I care about also



##### eve sedgwick #####







"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."



"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



#### worried about contrariness ####







Some level of my interest in Hannah More and disinterest in Wordsworth stems from a basic contrariness that I don’t think is the best motivation



#### I'm reading a lot of disreputable stuff ####







My reading list mixes canonical masterpieces with rubbish like “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” and “Almagro & Claude.” I… don’t think these things are better than the “good stuff,” though I do often appreciate their honesty.



#### timeliness sources ####

A bit Ted Underwood?







#### interesting ####







18thC usage of the word “interesting” doesn’t just mean “intriguing / inducing of curiosity” but “garnered invested interest in acting on behalf of”



I want to expand what we find interesting



#### Gamer precis ####







Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.



#### Romantic misfits ####







“The first [group of ‘misfits’] was excluded from literary history in order to secure the status of those writers who did ‘fit’ (the ‘Romantics’) even as the Romantics themselves based their claim to high literary status on their status as misfits-- on their success in transcending the literary marketplace to which other writers were represented as in thrall (because fitting too well).” (5)







“there are recurring themes, such as the manner in which the ‘structural transformation of the public sphere’ during the Romantic era is itself an integral aspect of the story of how ‘high’ literature was constructed at the expense of the ‘low’ (where ‘public engagement’ becomes a defining feature of the ‘low’, and self-cultivation a quality of ‘high’).” (6) — nowadays we value public engagement; at the time, politics/ethics was publicly engaged…?







	•	“As I see the literary culture of the period, there is a dialectical play between the radical Enlightenment and its counter. But instead of seeing the period Balkanized into three generations, with the first and last favoring ‘enlightenment modes’ and the middle settling into ‘reaction’ (or ‘Counter-Enlightenment’), I detect a constant dialectical play between these two poles that were subjectivities as much as they were political positions and, as a consequence, also stubbornly resistant to rational argument. This dialectical play is driven less by the French Revolution and more by the historical rupture it was seen to constitute. … The sense of crisis induced by the first intimation of ‘global synchronicity’, linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later, and they differ dialectically.” (11) 







#### David Brewer abstract ####







The recent quantitative turn in literary studies has reminded us of the breadth and variety of the literary field of the past. In so doing, however, it has necessarily levelled out the felt distinctions between various texts, and so risks working against the very sort of literary history that its new vistas promise: one which does justice to the workings of form across time and space. In particular, the presumptive interchangeability of texts that is required to put them into a series susceptible to quantitative analysis ignores the massively different footprint left by commercially successful (and socially canonical) texts as we move beyond their moment of initial publication. Evelina, for example, may have been just another novel of 1778 when it first appeared, but it loomed far above all other productions of that year a decade later (or anywhere beyond the metropole). Such footprints, I argue, changed the significance of their texts’ form, making it seem richer, thicker, more resonant or definitive—perhaps, for some, more stifling or oppressive—than that of their apparently similar but less successful counterparts.

	◦	“any study of the consequences of the reading of the past ought to consider the print which was actually read, not some modern selection… Nor can these approaches normally accommodate the fact that the impact of a text on its readers invariably occurred at a different time from when it was first written, and often in very different circumstances” “it cannot be enough to draw solely on the texts written in that period… Readers have never confined their reading to contemporary texts.” (3)

##### no one answer/arc for the period #####







Each author and work will have its own take on what feeling is for, where it comes from, how it is best to be evoked or controlled or used — and hence there is no arching narrative. But I can trace specific materials, like tears, ghosts, and nature



#### what to teach: convo with Jack copy ####







From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:







1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."







1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.







2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).







2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.







I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.







Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.







So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???

Reforming Gothic readers: repurposing the supernatural in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads



Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]



Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)



My project filling the gap: Hannah More!



Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.



[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

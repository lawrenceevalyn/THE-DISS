Reforming the Gothic reader in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads



Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]



Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)



My project filling the gap: Hannah More!



Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.



[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

# Guiding Principles #



## Reparative Reading ##







"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."



"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



## Information Density ##







I am on a quest for astonishingly dense synthesis.







I think this how how one properly accounts overwhelming detail and variety: lots of different bits of information all correlated with each other.



## Design ##







- keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your content



- information at exact point of need



- total indifference to mode of production is critical. (oh god, I'm going to lay out my whole diss in indesign, aren't I)







### Tufte's six principles of design: ###











1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences



2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemtic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't do anything with the information without causality)



3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate



4. completely integrate words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc



5. documentation must thorouhgly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales



6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.







# How do18thC corpora (mis)represent the 1790s? #







How do our current 18thC corpora (mis)represent the works printed in the 1790s? When we work with just one thing, or just the easiest thing, what do we leave out? What would decanonization look like?



sample a lot of different corpora; develop an ontology of genres; compare corpora; make an anti-recommendation engine ?



## flatten translations / foreign lang issues ##



### How much did people read in French? ###







Sales catalogues of French books? Are French books in England necessarily bootleg? (Scottish pirates?)



(Movements of goods from France to England generally — how did it work? Taxation data? Places outside Paris all bootlegging? )



# Does celebrity help men but hurt women? #







Does literary celebrity inhibit the formation of a lasting legacy? Or only for women? How do individual authors cultivate fame during my decade, of what kinds? Who was “most famous”? What sets the Romantics apart from the Della Cruscans?



develop metrics for literary celebrity (mentions in news? reprintings? responses?) and for current fame (anthologization? JSTOR?) and compare usefulness of celebrity as predictor of legacy



# What older works were reprinted strategically? #







What older works were reprinted strategically during the 1790s to respond to a new context? How did the timeliness of their printing affect how they were read? Was it probably men?



look for long gaps between printings or spikes; recapture historical context in detail



# Does "serious" fiction use "genre" fiction parasitically? #







What is the relationship between "genre fiction" and “literary" fiction? (Does “serious” fiction use “genre” fiction parasitically or does it have its own separate genre norms?) How do works market themselves? What makes writing “disreputable”? How do we recuperate “disreputable” writing?



?? read… stuff? try to play spot-the-gothic? build a case study of 1790s gothic vs 1750s sentimental vs later SF vs current romance??



# How much DO we know about the chapbook trade? #







If William St Clair is weak here, how much DO we know about the chapbook/pamphlet trade? How fast was a the cycle of responses between pamphlets? Are there geographic or social disjunctions in timeliness?



? read a lot of existing books; look for records of sale; look for bibliographic records of works with few pages; topic-model titles? — Read Franz Potter again



# How prevalent is Arab orientalism? #







something something orientalism and cosmopolitanism and 18thC Arabic literature?



find how much and what kinds of Arabic literature people were reading; read 1001 nights & compare to 18thC Arabic editions; re-learn Arabic

Algee-Hewitt, Mark. “Acts of Aesthetics: Publishing as Recursive Agency in the Long Eighteenth Century.” Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net 57-8 (2010). Web. 



Algee-Hewitt undertakes a computational analysis of a large volume of eighteenth-century works that themselves express alarm at the rising volume of texts being produced in the eighteenth century, to find an emerging consensus that written texts had the power to affect not only their readers, but also other texts. Algee-Hewitt thus provides a model for using computational methods to narrow down an enormous field to a new body of texts (or text extracts) which can then be informatively close-read in response to a research question.

Clery, E.J. The Rise of Supernatural Fiction 1762-1800. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995. Print. 



Clery tracks the rise of supernatural stories in fiction, drama, and popular news, producing a history of the Gothic that is sensitive to its impact in varying literary contexts. Clery thus provides a model for accounting for the movement of ideas between generic forms, and touches upon many of the key incidents and texts of interest to the first half of my inquiry.



## Frow, John. Genre ##







Frow, John. Genre. New York: Routledge, 2015. Print.



John Frow articulates genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2), framing genre not as a singular stable identifier for a novel but as a set of expectations that an author may strategically fulfill or foil. Genres thus function by being a bridge between the “social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, and a text that “realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). My own understanding of genre follows Frow’s.



## Gamer, Michael. Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception ##







Gamer, Michael. Romanticism and the Gothic: Genre, Reception, and Canon Formation. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2000. Print. 



Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.

This article analyses publication trends of history in early modern Britain and North America in 1470–1800, based on English Short- Title Catalogue (ESTC) data.2 Its major contribution is to demonstrate the potential of digitized library catalogues as an essential scholastic tool and part of reproducible research. We also introduce a novel way of quantitatively analysing a particular trend in book production, namely the publishing of works in the field of history. The study is also our first experimental analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production, and demonstrates in practice the importance of open-science principles for library and information science. Three main research questions are addressed: 1) who wrote history; 2) where history was published; and 3) how publishing changed over time in early modern Britain and North America. In terms of our main findings we demonstrate that the average book size of history publications decreased over time, and that the octavo-sized book was the rising star in the eighteenth century, which is a true indication of expand- ing audiences. The article also compares different aspects of the most popular writers on history, such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. Although focusing on history, these findings may reflect more widespread publishing trends in the early modern era. We show how some of the key questions in this eld can be addressed through the quantitative analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.3

McCarty’s detailed consideration of models, which explores the implications of the maxim that “all models are wrong; some models are useful,” informs my understanding of the relationship between computational literary research and the mental modelling inherent to ‘analog’ literary research.

This collection of essays recaptures the development in Moretti’s career of his theories of literary history as evolutionary and as an imbalanced center-periphery system of exchange, alongside his increasing use of computational methods that come to be known as ‘distant reading.’ Moretti’s interest in accounting for the “great unread” of literature, and his use of computational models to carry out comparative research, provides much of the theoretical background for my own methods.

O’Quinn, Daniel. “Half-History, or The Function of Cato at the Present Time.” Georgian Theatre in an Information Age: Media, Performance, Sociability, special issue of Eighteenth-Century Fiction 27.3-4 (2015). Project Muse. Web. 



O’Quinn discusses three particular performances of Joseph Addison’s Cato (1713) and a famous 1812 portrait of John Philip Kemble in the role of Cato, in order to compare each production’s allegory of George III’s political position and to make a broader argument about the use of partially forgetting the past when re-staging history. O’Quinn’s article, like the majority of those in this special issue of Eighteenth-Century Fiction, thus models the examination of literary work in context with its moment and with other forms of artistic production

p.1: . Contemporary theories of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought most often focus on the philosophic or cultural goals of aesthetics, while media-oriented studies use the rapid increase and increasing availability of print to read coextensive changes into eighteenth-century economic, political and social practice. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: The synthesis that unites the texts which criticize print in the eighteenth century is their dependence upon the very medium they seek to limit -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3:  we can identify a subject/object unity in the negative responses to printing technology that calls into question the use of the very medium under critique to stage the critique. How did Enlightenment authors understand this vicious cycle of printed critiques of print to aid in solving the problem of the overload of print? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: If aesthetics and theories of taste are an attempt to organize, categorize and limit the range of responses to art, then their focus on writing suggests the possibility of an underlying cognizance of the crisis of print. This follows from the expansion of the technology itself: the need for a theory of taste to control the range of responses to aesthetic objects is a response to the crisis occasioned by the exponentially increasing availability of just these objects -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: Again, we are left with the question: how does printing more works offer a solution to the problem of too many printed works? Read another way, what can print DO, what action can it take self-reflexively, such that it can form its own limitations through multiplication? -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: the problem isn't too many printed works -- it's too many of the WRONG kinds of printed works, to which THEIR works are obviously an exception -- Written May 2, 2017







p.3: Generated from the data contained within the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (or ECCO) database, this chart, Figure 1, which can be generated from any representative sample of printed work during this period, is likewise a familiar visual.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: runs into the same situation as faced by the writers of the period themselves: there are simply too many works to adequately comprehend or represent through our traditional strategies of close reading -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: If aesthetic theory did respond to the increase in printed materials during the eighteenth century, particularly in Britain, then we should witness a shift in writing whose existence can be traced back to the increase in print itself, separate from and in addition to any critical transformations offered by any individual author. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.3: THIS is an extremely compelling way to use these charts— to identify which inflection points we already expect, and to hypothesize a new one -- Written May 2, 2017







p.4: reconstructing the effects of the increase of print on aesthetic writing in a way that potentially navigates the two difficulties described above: the sheer volume of printed work and, more problematically, our implicit biases as literary scholars towards narrative histories of aesthetic theory and philosophy -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.4: Rather than reading for the substance of each work, these methods can allow us to examine the linguistic traces that certain texts on aesthetics share: this, in turn, gives us access to the way in which these authors conceived of aesthetics, rather than their specific aesthetic theories themselves. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: While this sample only represents a small subset of the large number of works written onaesthetics available in digital formats, the exploratory nature of this pilot study assumes that the need for clarity surpasses the potential for comprehension. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: In order to ensure that the sample was comprised of works on aesthetic theory that were representative of the period and yet still evidenced some cognizance of print culture, I used a set of hierarchically weighted terms to identify key texts.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: why just use R's standard chart? this is not a very nuanced way to present this information.. in fact, without the book names, it feels practically meaningless -- Written May 2, 2017







p.5:  The closer the relationship between two texts, the lower on the y axis the two texts are connected. The higher the connection, therefore, the less the lexical elements of the text overlap in their arrangement.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.5: The remaining texts fall into two clear groups. While there is no obvious thematic or generic regularity that would indicate the principle ofselection, the metadata on these samples reveals an interesting pattern -- Highlighted May 2, 2017

p.6:  these chronological limits coincide with the beginnings of the radical increase in -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: print during the 1760s and 1770s. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6:  this transformation seems to indicate a change in the way aesthetic authors wrote about print in the later and post-Enlightenment -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: If we were to retrace the historical contingency of this period of transformation, we can, of course, locate a key event in print history that falls within the limit of this transformation. In 1774, the case of Donaldson vs. Beckett, over the right of Scottish printers to print runs of James Thomson’s The Seasons, repealed the common practice of perpetual copyright and reinstated the 14 year limit on copyright -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6:  as the shift that St. Clair describes in the reading public of England involved the increased participation of the lower classes in the public sphere, the shift in theories of taste might indicate a reactionary response to the opening of the reading public to these new groups. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: The historically based clustering that we can interpret in this model could therefore be evidence of a classbased response to the change in print technology: this aligns the aesthetic theory under investigation here with Roy Porter’s hypothesis that taste “made the new social adhesive which would cement propertied élites together” (Porter 195) -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: The model, unfortunately, does not provide a one-to-one correlative field onto which we can read this transformation precisely: what it does do is allow us to reframe the question “how does aesthetic theory change in response to print technology?”, instead allowing us to ask: “how does the copyright window affect the language of aesthetics and what does this tell us about the ways in which aesthetics covertly responds to changes in print production?” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.6: so he's done one rather small experiment, really, and turned a vague question into a more precise one / a hypothesis.. this is the standard for literary experimentation -- Written May 2, 2017







p.7: We can also interrogate the model to potentially identify the nature of the shifts in language that took place in the later eighteenth century. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.7:  What linguistic elements, in other words, changed in the ways in which authors wrote about aesthetics during this period?  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.7: terms that are frequent in one set, but absent in another would be among the most informative identifiers of group selection -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.7: By dividing the sample into the two groups indicated by the dendrogram and then individually identifying the 30 highest frequency terms in each sub-sample (Figure 4), we can locate potential signifiers that are responsible for the categorization we have witnessed. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.8:  In the first group, the unique words appear to be more descriptive in nature: words like “poetry,” “composition” and “art” represent a range of subjects for the theory, while “Poet,” “style,” “genius” and “imagination” provide a descriptive terminology for the process of creation. No similar groups of objects or actors appears in the second: instead, the unique terms seem to focus less on the creation of the aesthetic object by an agent and instead, indicate an interest in the “effect” of the aesthetic object on the “passions” or the “human.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9: I'm not sure that all this speculation is informative -- Written May 2, 2017







p.9: Before using these results to aid in a critical reading of the texts themselves, it is worthwhile to test this assumption: if action does assume a new importance within the later Enlightenment and Romantic periods specifically in relation to the discipline of aesthetics and theories of taste, then the texts in our sample should show some variation based upon the their discussions of action within the context of our other key terms. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9:  While texts from the first group (predominantly early eighteenthcentury texts) cluster tightly towards the left side of the graph, the texts from the second group vary greatly across the x axis. From this model, we can interpret two key conclusions. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9: the use of “act” or “action” in relation to discussions of taste, writing and printing did change between the early and late eighteenth century -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.9: the ways in which these terms were used varied greatly after this transformation, as evidenced by the radical change in cluster size -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.10: this graph is HORRIBLE and not informative at all -- Written May 2, 2017







p.10: what appears to change is the description of how art, and specifically printed writing, brings action into being. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: This clear chain of linkages provides a map through which, at least according to Campbell, the end result of art is action. Unlike Dennis’ cyclical progression, the structure of Campbell’s chain of affective response is linear: pointing away from the text into the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: Campbell’s method of “directing” the proper set of responses to literary production is the work, or the action, of his text itself. Similarly, Reeves’ text, written in the genre of a dialogue, also functions as a system through which the production and dissemination of texts can be regulated. Both authors depend upon the very principles of action that they advocate in their own aesthetic theory to perform the work of this theory itself.  -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: the active power of print is effective enough that the only methods through which it can be limited lie within the set of active functions that it makes possible -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: allows us to re-imagine aesthetics as a set of controls: philosophic controls on the reception of art and its place in the organizational system of Enlightenment thought; social controls limiting behavior based upon a set of moral and intellectual criteria; and technological controls seeking to limit the actionable possibilities of print through a redirection of its agency back towards its own action in the world. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.11: Rather than a synthesis of action and thought between two areas of human endeavor, as Cassirer suggests, we can instead rethink aesthetics itself as a method of social action that uses the technology of print to create a unity in itself between thinking and doing -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: The total sample of 28 texts included 1,547,762 words: while it is reasonable to surmise that a literary scholar could analyze this quantity of language, he or she could do so based only on comprehension of the subject or idiosyncrasies of individual texts, not on word usage or lexical patterns among groups of texts. The strength of the quantitative aspects to the model I propose here lies in its ability to identify patterns of word usage that are not apparent within the text. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: 28 is tiny!! -- Written May 2, 2017







p.13: The specific search terms were: “publish,” “print,” “write,” “author,” “poet,” “scribbl*,” “press,” “literature,” “books,” “read,” “pen,” and “taste.” -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: [8] Because many of the tokens appeared in just one or two texts, and were therefore not useful in clustering the sample as a whole, the total number of terms was reduced to the most significant with the removeSparseTerms function using a sparsity of 0.4. This removes all terms with a greater than 40% probability of having zero occurrences in any given document. -- Highlighted May 2, 2017







p.13: hmm -- I've been trying to resist my impulses toward tidy clustering; sometimes text are outliers, and a long tail is to be expected.. not everything reduces down to a few categories -- Written May 2, 2017

Although much of Drucker’s discussion of our contemporary relationship to visual interfaces is tangential to this project, her monograph includes a highly-relevant discussion of the use of data visualizations in varying disciplines. This discussion expands on her 2011 article “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” (Digital Humanities Quarterly 5.1) to highlight the importance of avoiding a false appearance of observer-independent objective truth in humanities visualizations. Her warnings will continue to shape my own creation and use of visualizations as I seek to make sense of my large bodies of information.

Fischer-Starcke, Bettina. Corpus Linguistics in Literary Analysis: Jane Austen and Her Contemporaries. London: Continuum, 2010. Print. 



The first half of this work introduces best practices for corpus analysis of literature, with an emphasis on theoretical frameworks regarding the subjectivity of analysis, the bias inherent in the selection of texts, and the interpretive limits of the results. The second half of this work compares Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey to Austen’s other works and to a wider body of her contemporaries, producing both a useful case study and specific results of interest to my inquiry. Fischer-Starcke thus provides a model for my own application of corpus linguistics. 







## McLeod, The Minerva Press ##







“I base my quantitative analysis on a data base which I have developed of 1636 works. Over a thousand (1036) of these works were published between 1790 and 1820. Of these 1036 works, I have inspected, in varying degrees of thoroughness, 483. … I tried to read as many of these works as possible and currently have plot notes for 227 novels, including 96 from the 1790s, 68 from between 1800 and 1809, and 63 from between 1810 and 1820.” (13)



“What I have discovered in my analysis of the press's corpus is a previously unappreciated diversity both in genre and sub-genre.” (13)



“Based on her study of Samuel Clay's records, Jan Fergus brings into question five of what she refers to as “the six cliches about the eighteenth-century provincial reading public": that women were the vast majority of patrons of circulating libraries, that women borrowed novels exclusively and voraciously, that servants and apprentices borrowed books in large numbers, that the middle class had come to dominate the reading public, and tht there was a greatly expanded provincial readership. The single "cliche" for which Fergus finds support is that novels were the most popular genre in circulating libraries.” (34)

“The "favorite authors" are all women: Anna Maria Bennett, Regina Maria Roche, Elizabeth [sic] Meeke, Agnes Musgrave, Anna Howell, Mary Charlton, Isabella Kelly, Elizabeth Parsons, Elizabeth Bonhote, and Anna Maria M’Kenzie.” (39)







"Lane claims "All the Works complete of Robertson, Johnson, Henry, Hume, Locke, Pope, Rapin, Goldsmith, Milton, Smollett, Richardson, Garrick, Gibbons, Voltaire, Addison, Rollin, Littleton, Sterne, Shakespeare, Bolingbroke, Fielding, &c.," as well as “every Author of the present Age”” (40)







"the notion that female-gendered authorship was being used to signal a particular kind or kinds of novel or to sell novels in general may partially account for fluctuations of anonymous publication and the indications that many male authors felt compelled to gender themselves female on the titlepages of their novels." (42)







“At the Minerva Press, William Lane, who had printed 11 items in the 1770s and 131 in the 1780s, produced 402 in the 1790s.” (48)

“works may be classified in more than one category. Thus, a work may appear in two categories within a table (as in both epistolary and sentimental) or be listed in both tables (as in translation and courtship).” (56)

“courtship plots are by far the most popular, indeed popular to such an extent that their placement on such a chart may be virtually meaningless, since one finds didactic courtship plots, gothic courtship plots, sentimental courtship plots, and so on. ... The category sentimental is equally pervasive, though it does not appear so according to my figures. It can be argued that virtually /every/ Minerva Press novel -- and perhaps even the majority of novels of the Minerva Press period — has at least some elements which could be classified as sentimental.” (57)

"If we cannot locate aesthetic value of texts in themselves (…) yet do not want to abolish questions of value altogether, it needs to be located elsewhere. The author, pronounced dead in post-structuralism, and in any case conspicuously absent in most mass-mediated forms of textuality, has proven an unsuitable basis for textual interpretation and evaluation. However, if we can distinguish texts and meaning creation as radically as Jenkins’s (1992) distinction between exceptional texts and exceptional readings suggests, the reader appears to be a no-better indicator of the aesthetic value of texts, since exceptional readings would thus appear to be based upon form of audience activity quite independent of texts themselves. If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested."

In some ways this is a meta-paper about some big questions that the Cultural Studies turn to the active audience - and to fans specifically - raises. The key question Sandvoss is grappling with is, how do we judge the aesthetic value of a text? How do we know if it’s any good? He raises several challenges to such aesthetic judgements that Cultural Studies has come up against. One is the vastly expanded definition of “text”: Cultural Studies doesn’t just look at novels and poems, which is what we might ordinarily imagine as texts. It investigates TV shows, songs, games, ads and even, on occasion, crisp packets. Another challenge is the “death of the author” - the idea that what the author intended doesn’t actually matter hugely when it comes to what a reader or an audience gets out of a text. Not only that, but the author becomes an incredibly nebulous concept when we start thinking about texts like video games or TV shows. So authorial intent doesn’t really help us in judging the aesthetic value of a text. Neither, says Sandvoss, does the text itself, as Cultural Studies has become increasingly sceptical of the idea that the text has any intrinsic meaning: rather meaning is made by the audience. (Have a look at some of our previous posts for some ideas on how this is done in fanfiction.) So aesthetic value isn’t a feature of the author, the text, or the reader on their own. It must therefore lie in the interaction between the three. Sandvoss goes on to argue that aesthetic value can be measured in the gap or distance between reader and text. How much of a challenge is the text to the reader’s preconcieved notions about the world? How much does it make the reader think, feel, re-evaluate what they thought they knew? That’s where Sandvoss ultimately pins aesthetic value.



What do you think?



(via fanhackers)



“If we cannot locate aesthetic value in the author, text, or reader alone, it is in the process of interaction between these that aesthetic value is manifested” – yes. Love it. Love. It. That magical, ineffable process of interaction!



I’m not entirely won over by the idea of aesthetic value being measured (why measured?) by the degree to which a text challenges the reader’s preconceived notions. I think that’s one potentially fruitful avenue, but not the only one.



Anyway, interesting. I should look this up.

“The Apocrypha “are the plays attributed to, but emphatically not by, Shakespeare” (3). They are “a deeply problematic group on the fringe of Shakespeare Studies””



“Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha rebels against that trend, marshaling literary criticism, critical canon theory, attribution studies, and historical sleuthing in an eclectic and ambitious attempt to interrogate the apocryphal nature of the Apocrypha.

Alan Liu, _Wordsworth: The Sense of History_: this is an extraordinary, although quite difficult book. On its surface, it's a New Historicist account of Wordsworth's poetry. However, I've learned more about aesthetics in general from this book than from most other Romanticist criticism. (For one of many, many examples in this book, see Liu's brilliant discussion of "atmosphere" in landscape painting and poetry from essentially the Middle Ages to Wordsworth in his chapter on Wordsworth and the picturesque--in a few brief pages, one gets an incredibly helpful art history account that also illuminates Wordsworth's poetry)

## Special Fields list rationale ##







Although the dissertation itself will focus narrowly on texts published 1789-99, this reading list seeks to contextualize those works within the fifty-year period 1770-1820. Attention is paid to Romanticism, the Gothic, and sentimental fiction as interrelated literary movements. Major Romantic, Gothic, and sentimental works are selected for their longstanding influence and prevalence in critical conversations. These landmark texts provide the canonical touchstones of the period. To support inquiry into popular literature of the period, the list also includes chapbooks, both Gothic and religious, some didactic literature, and several dramas. Selections of prose non-fiction from the period provide contemporaneous thinking on generic form and the purposes of literature.  The key authors highlighted in the thesis-specific readings are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More. Some comparatively minor works by these four authors are included in order to represent each author’s writing in multiple genres. Secondary criticism sheds light either on the historical period or on the intended computational methodology. Works concerned with the eighteenth century contextualize popular reading practices and relationships between literary modes. The ‘digital humanities’ secondary works emphasize theory over technique. A few titles provide an overview of the great variety of methods and debates currently prevalent in the field, while the majority — including some non-computational works — engage with ideas of ‘distant’ and ‘surface’ reading. Overall, the list balances the key texts of late eighteenth century literature with an interest in ‘the great unread.’



## Thesis Proposal ##



### background ###







This dissertation will build on my previous research on the Gothic novel 1790-1830. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the period’s critics anxiously noted, was characterized by excessive volume. The English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly sixteen thousand works published in England the 1730s, a figure which has doubled by the 1780s (which see thirty-two thousand works), and tripled by the 1790s (which see forty-eight thousand). As circulating libraries, too, increased in number, each book could reach more readers. In this context of what Michael Gamer describes as “exploding literacy rates accompanied by an increasingly bewildering and diverse collection of reading audiences” (32), it became ever harder to make sense of the literary world as a cohesive whole. My MA research sought to contextualize the novels of Gothic writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe by setting them alongside their now-forgotten peers from the shelves of circulating libraries. I was interested in investigating the critical association of these authors with distinctly gendered male and female schools of writing. I examined plot information from two bibliographies of the Gothic, and found that Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* was, indeed, characteristic of a minor group of “Male Gothic” novels containing elements of horror and violence not to be found in works by women. However, my method did not reveal any corresponding subject matter that was the sole domain of women writers in several hundred novels. Moreover, it revealed many ways in which Ann Radcliffe’s novels were markedly different from the rest of the texts usually assigned to the “school of Radcliffe.” My dissertation will build on this work. I will continue to contextualize Radcliffe among her peers, but I will not begin by trying to isolate the determining characteristics of a self-contained field of “the Gothic.” Instead, my primary aim will be to capture the great variety within the literary realm as a whole in England from 1789 to 1799.



### driving research Qs ###







My plan is to approach the “great unread” of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers’ use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. I will work with the three models simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.



### critical context ###







This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets’ own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying careful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about “surface reading” or “literal reading” as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the “distant reading” methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description. Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to  the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. 



### methods ###



#### model 1: ESTC ####







The ESTC has records on 51,965 works printed in England during this decade. The ESTC has already provided me with their core bibliographical records of the authors, titles, and imprints for these works. Research by Leo Lahti and others, which examines similar basic bibliographic data for 50,766 works categorized as history in the ESTC, has demonstrated some fruitful techniques for research at this scale. I will deploy these and similar techniques in order to identify influential authors and major groupings of texts. I expect to see, from multiple reprintings of her works, that Ann Radcliffe was an increasingly popular author in my decade, and to find her influence visible in the titles of works published in the wake of her success. 



I will also look in more detail at some subsets of my 51,965 items. Taking cues from Steven Zwicker, I will use random sampling to extract a small enough list that I can research the works’ publication history and content. I believe this will enable me to assemble a frame of reference for the relative popularity of particular generic forms within the mediascape in the late 1700s. By briefly reading these sampled works with an eye to their political content, I also hope to get a sense of the extent to which works in this group openly describe their political agendas.



#### model 2: ECCO-TCP ####







I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP provides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women’s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to compare the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors. Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of their language-- especially those features that mark any them as outliers.



#### model 3: reading ####







Finally, I will turn to yet closer readings of a yet smaller corpus, examining the works of a few authors in detail. I seek to understand the idiosyncratic relationship of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson within the public sphere of letters, and to build an argument about their employment of different generic forms. In order to take full advantage of the affordances of a close-reading model, I will pursue works which have been excluded from digital repositories, especially chapbooks. I will also attend to facsimile editions or first editions to consider the material conditions for some works’ entry into literary circulation. As I read these works, I will seek the connections between them and their context which only human reading can untangle. I will likely supplement my reading with what Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann dub “deformative” reading practices; I expect to rely on small handmade indexes, timelines, and data visualizations.



### conclusion ###







Although I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will research them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be said to be “representative” of this decade? And what do they “represent”?

## OGS Plan of Study ##







A recent article by Bode exemplifies a current shift in approaches to digitally-enhanced literary scholarship. Bode builds a critique of “distant reading” pioneers Franco Moretti and Matthew Jockers, arguing that they too often disregard the provenance of the thousands of texts they select for study. When distant reading treats its mass corpora as complete and objective, Bode argues, it is not different from New Criticism’s technique of close reading, which attempts to dismiss historical context as irrelevant. As an alternative, Bode calls for scholarly editions of literary systems, rather than individual texts, in order to produce a “data-rich literary history” that integrates computational research with the textual scholarship of fields like bibliography and book history. My dissertation answers this call by systematically researching all texts printed in England between the years 1789 to 1799.







I have narrowed my scope to an eleven-year “decade,” keyed to the French Revolution, to make my inquiry feasible. Late eighteenth-century literary production, as the writers of the period anxiously observed, was characterized by incredible volume. In the 1730s, the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) records roughly 16,000 works published in England: this number triples, to 48,000 works, in the 1790s. I hypothesize that the works published in the 1790s — whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand — were characterized by an unusual attention to timeliness, with frequently-revised editions responding to rapidly shifting political events and literary tastes. I follow Michael Gamer in applying this market-based framework even to the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose era-defining Lyrical Ballads was published in 1798.







To account for the true variety and complex interconnectedness of the literary mediascape during this period, I will borrow methodologies from distant reading and corpus stylistics, but I will marry these to bibliographic textual studies and traditional literary interpretation. I will work with four collections of texts, or corpora, of different sizes and from different sources, which allow me to view my decade from multiple perspectives. I have already acquired bibliographic records for 51,965 works listed in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC), my largest and most “distant” corpus. I am in the process of acquiring 4,381 full-length texts from HathiTrust; these texts can be unreliable, but include many works not available elsewhere, including works not listed in the ESTC. I have already acquired 502 full-length texts from the Eighteenth Century Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP), which have been carefully marked up in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards, enabling more detailed computational exploration of their subject matter. 







I have identified four authors whose ‘case studies’ will contextualize my larger-scale findings. These authors are Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically and influentially during the 1790s, but are not generally accorded a prominent place in the modern literary canon.







The Ontario Graduate Scholarship would fund the fourth year of my five-year PhD program, during which I hope to complete a rough first draft of my dissertation. I have already begun to explore my corpora individually; during this year, I will build a personal database to integrate them and seek correlations. My inquiry will discover fresh insights into how English writers used literature to cope with what appeared to be near-apocalyptic political upheaval during the French Revolution, and will recontextualize the Romantic poets whose reputations have outstripped those of their more popular peers. My novel methodology reconciling disparate corpora will also provide a valuable precedent for Digital Humanities literary scholars in other fields who wish to pursue data-rich literary history.

### MY POSITION ###



#### 2 ideas: feeling & timeliness ####







Reading Feeling, Writing Timeliness:



Eighteenth-Century Strategies for Ethical Literature



To define a decade study of English literature by the milestones of the French Revolution is to implicity stake a claim to a set of themes and contexts: the tension between sensibility and rationalism, as assessment of national identity and history, the role of the public sphere. Late eighteenth-century writers — and not just the radicals — were engaged with a project testing the uses of literature. Two contentious elements of literature, the complex and variable interrelationship of which my study foregrounds, are feeling and timeliness. Both concepts shape eighteenth century writing, and my approach to it. “Feeling” as a central idea refers both to the literature of sensibility as an evolving counterpoint to enlightenment rationalism, and to contemporary processes of reparative reading which foreground the limits of scholarly critique. “Timeliness” encompasses both the urgent responses of the eighteenth century mediascape to a perceived historical rupture, and to an exhaustively particular methodology of historicized textual study. Although my project remains quantitative and computational in its technological foundations, my central interest remains with the field of eighteenth century studies, rather than the field of the digital humanities.



#### feeling ####



##### 18thC feeling #####







Reading Feeling



My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. Competing definitions of the effects of sympathy had high-stakes political and ethical implications: does universal sympathy unite all people into a moral society of citizens, or do emotional interpretations of events blind people to rational justice? When literature excites a strong emotional response, is this a healthy form of exercise for its audience’s moral feeling, or a weakening distraction from real moral action? These questions, in translated form, continue to shape my own questions about literature as a field: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor the importance of feeling without being misled by emotional manipulation?



The “major” works across the period are characterized by sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. My interest in the gothic and the supernatural is thus subsumed within a larger conversation about the representation of feeling. As Clery, Miles, and Gamer have explored in different ways, gothic and supernatural stories encompass a subset of literary strategies to understand and use feeling, which exist in conversation and competition with other strategies. Each work must strike its own balance between exciting the feelings of its readers, and moderating them. The simplest narrative tracing this development begins with a naive emotional philosophy of benevolence in sentimental novels, which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature.



##### Sedgwick #####







Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as “paranoid reading,” and introduces the idea of “reparative reading” as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: “The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one’s findings: “What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.” The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. 



##### Felski #####







Felski’s monograph promises a more resounding answer to Sedgwick’s tentative groundwork. The Limits of Critique, however, is centrally focused, as per its title, on current practices of critique and the limits of those practices. Its extended discussion (and, at points, critique) of the practice of critique highlights similarities between conversations about reading in the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries. For example, when Felski hyperbolically lists the “unserious” reading practices which are presumed to be the only alternative to critique, “naive reading, sentimental effusion, impressionistic judgment, fuzzy-headed amateurism, and mere ‘chatter about Shelley’,” sentimentality is explicitly named alongside forms of ‘sloppy’ thinking that are presumed to be incompatible with rationality. The need to maintain rationality in the face of emotion takes on moral implications in Felski’s hyperbole as well: without critique, the question goes, “what will save us from perdition, what will keep us from committing all those sins we’ve been warned against,” what will keep us from being dangerously bad readers? Of course, part of Felski’s conclusion is that these forms of “bad reading” are not, despite their emotional contamination, morally wrong or intellectual vacuous — but like Sedgwick, she sketches her alternative lightly.



##### closeness / interest #####







Both Felski and Sedgwick suggest a greater acknowledgement of what an eighteenth century writer might term the interest we have in the texts we study. For a story to be “interesting,” in the late eighteenth century, means not only that it is informative or narratively compelling, but that it makes a claim on the emotional investment of its audience. One is not only interested in others, but interested for others, with the potential of actively demonstrating that interest through social assistance. Felski describes this as “a judicious decrease rather than an increase of distance -- a willingness to acknowledge and more fully engage our attachments.” As a scholarly practice to demonstrate this closeness, Felski gestures towards what she terms “neophenomenology,” “a sustained attention to the sheer range and complexity of aesthetic experiences, including moments of recognition, enchantment, shock, and knowledge.” Felski has begun this work by establishing a greater richness for the vocabulary of “identifying” with characters. Determining whether a character is “relatable” enough to “identify with” is often a key concern for undergraduate readers and for 18thC thinkers: Felski distinguishes literary itentification into at least three types, “structural or formal alignment, moral allegiance, and emotional empathy,” which could be useful for untangling the allegiance required of different works of sentimental literature. Felski thus begins to locate “post-critical, rather than uncritical” forms of “serious thinking” which could both shed light on and be modified by eighteenth-century practices.



#### reparative > timeliness transition ####







The goal of this serious thinking, for Felski, is to remind us “that our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices, are not those around which past lives were organized” — a discovery which will “shock” us but also reinvigorate us, proving the necessary prerequisite to understant that future ways of life will also be organized differently. For Sedgwick, too, the possibility of “surprise” in a non-paranoid reading, the idea that even the most predictable past events could have unfolded differently, is crucial for imagining change in the future. Our response to this alterity, however, marks one of the major differences between current scholarly work to integrate feeling into our understanding, and eighteenth century discourses. The late eighteenth century, and particularly the period in the 1790s defined by the ongoing aftershocks of the French Revolution, saw a similar acknowledgement that “our institutions and ways of life, passions and prejudices” are not universal and invulnerable. Robert Miles is one of many to describe the impact of the French Revolution as centred less on individual events, and more on the alarming “historical rupture” which the revolution was seen to constitute. For many, this rupture represented an opportunity for optimism — but many more experienced the turmoil as near-apocalyptic, and even for optimists the sense of impending change was often uncomfortable. Miles argues that a widespread sense of profound change shaped far more than just political thought: “The sense of crisis … linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later.” One way that these works were shaped by their context is a heightened sense of timeliness for published works.

Writing Timeliness



Whether newly written or reprinted to meet new demand, texts take on shifting meanings as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and recontextualized over time. The changing impact of works over time is most obvious in overtly political works like Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, whose relationship with, for example, Helen Maria Williams’ Letters from France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men was directly determined by the extent to which the works in question were considered to have been borne out by political events. But time-sensitive readings, and an expected textual responsiveness for current events, extended to to literary works as well.



Novels which, in scholarly editions, give the illusion of being singular, unified objects are nearly all the result of a more complicated and responsive process of coming into being. As Tristram Shandy was composed and published, for example, each new installment slightly shifted its emphasis, so that the emerging narrative only gradually solidified into what are, in retrospect, its major concerns. Particularly notable is the way that volumes 7 through 9 of Tristram Shandy, written after the publication of The Castle of Otranto, incorporate Gothic materials differently than the earlier volumes; rather than being one text with one interpretation of the role of the supernatural in heightening readerly emotion, Shandy was a phenomenon which unfolded and varied over time. Even works which were not printed in installments, like Matthew Lewis’s The Monk and Walter Scott’s Waverley, could change in content and in popular reception with a new edition.



Similarly, Lyrical Ballads is often studied in the context of its 1798, 1800, and 1802 editions, but William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge seem to have been following standard poetic practice by writing new prefaces, selecting new poems, and re-editing their works for a new emphasis. Charlotte Smith enacts similar changes across the dozen editions of Elegiac Sonnets printed between 1784 and 1812. Smith’s 1797 edition, for example, includes a new preface, re-selects the non-sonnet poems, and adds new sonnets to create a “new” work out of poems which were as many as thirteen years old. The edition presents her as a politically engaged poet, directly relevant to the events of her day, whose radical philosophies are salient even in her earliest sonnets.



##### bibliographers #####







My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair’s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer’s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the “parade of authors” and “parliament of texts” models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the “footprint” left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski’s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “resonance,” which takes Brewer’s “footprint” as the primary object of study to trace the “busy afterlife of the literary artifact” which “refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.” This “busy afterlife” can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work’s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. 



##### combine in Goldsmith #####







A particularly interesting text which might reward a study of both its timeliness and its use of feeling is Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, which was first published in 1766 but continued to be frequently reprinted in the 1790s. The persistence of Wakefield immediately undermines any literary history which wholly relegates the sentimental novel to the 1760s and 1770s. However, by the 1790s Wakefield is no longer competing with The Man of Feeling (which many of its former dedicated readers now regarded with embarassment), and instead was read alongside the contemporary literature of sensibility in the Gothic mode. There is much still to be uncovered about how readers in the 1790s made very different sense of this work’s political and religious sermons, dramatic and moving prison scenes, and moralizing love-plot.

The Digital Humanities



Timeliness and feeling, as investigated through bibliographical research and reparative reading, thus chart a tangled network of interrelated concepts. Reparative reading requires an openess to the multiplicity of meaning which works may accrue as they are printed, reprinted, revised, and adapated in response to the pressures of timeliness. Precise bibliographical research can recapture and contextualize the complex and variable strategies of feeling that competed throughout the period. Not yet integrated into this set of priorities and methodological frameworks is the element of my project which often requires the most justification: my use of quantitative and computational methodologies.



##### DH as historical breach #####







“Digital humanities” is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke’s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified “digital humanities” work.



##### McCarty: interdisciplinary #####







Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that “[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation”: the current state of “digital humanities” research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to “hard sciences.” The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables — an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti — is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,” it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy — a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.







### stray ideas ###







Its priorities are tantalizingly attuned to those of the literature of sensibility itself.



#### complicate the arc ####







In its broadest strokes, this narrative is probably mostly true, and can certainly be useful. Nonetheless, I wish to complicate it by seeking to reconcile “major” works with their “minor” peers, and by foregrounding what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. My interest in noncanonical works stems from a desire to recognize the real variety of responses expressed throughout the period in question. Even when one literary affective mode is at its peak popularity, other opinions are being expressed and other tools are being employed. [Just because an idea doesn’t “win” its year doesn’t make it uninteresting; rather, the opposite.] Moreover, individual authors evolve in opinion over time, and even individuals works change in meaning over time, hence my interest in timeliness.



#### conclusion ####







I hope to integrate my computational and quantitative research into a fully humanities project by largely refusing to centre the technological elements of my methodology, either in terms of its practice or in terms of its theory. I completely reject the aura of empiricist objectivity which quantitative and computational methods attempt to surround themselves with. I embrace the messiness and intimacy of modelling. Trying to integrate attentiveness to textual detail and emotional openness will be good for “DH.”



#### position attempt 1 ####







My readings have traced the development, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, of a complex negotiation regarding the role of feeling in the public sphere and in literature. The “major” works across the period develop from sentimental novels before the 1780s, to political philosophy and gothic novels during the 80s and 90s, to romantic poetry at the turn of the 19th century. I want to pose the same questions as the authors themselves: what should one read, and how should one read it, if one wishes to honor one’s feelings without being misled by them? In pursuit of this answer, my reading has led me to a subject matter, a methodology, and an affective stance.



I remain committed, for my subject matter, to the 1790s as an incredibly dense period of complex literary production shaped by what Robert Miles identifies as an apocalyptic political rupture.



The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change. For example, there is a narrative about a naive emotional philosophy in sentimental novels (benevolence), which gets exposed as flawed by the rationalist political philosophy of the 80s and 90s and must grapple with its failures in the gothic literature of that period, and which forms a new balance though elevation and retrospection in romantic literature. Perhaps, at its broadest level, this narrative is true or useful, but there are many more ways in which it is false.



One way which I seek to be more accurate is by paying close attention to what I refer to as the “timeliness” of a work. So, for example, I am interested in Burke’s Reflections as a text which is outcompeted by Williams when it is first published, and attracts a flood of negative responses, but which slowly outcompetes the others and becomes more successful over time as it gains credit for its prescience.



As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one.



My interest in the gothic is thus subsumed within my interest in 18thC strategies of feeling generally; gothic fear and supernatural imagination both represent strategies which are in conversation (and competition) with other strategies, which I also want to integrate.







#### exhaustive particularity ####

I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the “parade of authors” ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the “parliament of authors” mode, though I may have to give in to that one; I think exhaustive particularty might be my way out.



##### DH #####







(1a) I am excited about the ways that distant reading allows the consideration of more works, and thus an expansion of the works under discussion.  I’ll probably make a database trying to combine all the stuff I have, and definitely make a lot of artisanal hand-crafted “small data.



(1b) I am also excited about the recursive reflective process of modelling: the usefulness of making one’s models and their parameters explicit and testing multiple models; the need to actually meaningfully *account for* the full variety of what one is working with, to grapple with and reconcile outliers.”



My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline.



Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, “research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all” (McCarty). These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.



“The range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation.” … “Between these two is what seems to me the ideal – a combination, not compromise, of centrifugal freedom and centripetal beholdenness.” (McCarty) 



“digital humanities offers a middle ground or conjectural space within which, data being simply data, the objects of study dear to the humanities may be treated temporarily as if they were objects of nature, like rocks or stars, then the results of that treatment juxtaposed to how we see them and questions asked.” (McCarty)



#### intro ####







I wish to produce a comprehensive account of the strategies of feeling employed by writers and readers in England in the face of the French apocalypse. I care about disreputable texts. I think I can do this by paying attention to works’ timeliness with exhaustive detail of particularity. As one way to apply the lessons learned from 18thC readings, I want to enact a reparative digital humanities.



I’m interested in strategies of feeling as an ethical concern which lives on today with discussions of reparative reading, and I’m interested in textual timeliness as subject matter that can shed light on the individuality of text’s strategies of feelings through bibliographical and computational research.



My thinking has led me to a methodology, a subject matter, and a philosophical/emotional stance.



The literature itself offers strategies for emotional self-management, which readers must practice/enact by responding appropriately to the text. I want to identify these strategies, while resisting broad myths of chronological change.



### guidelines ###







--- remember this process is unsatisfying inherently. choose like 3/100 ideas, and explain them well in your position paper; the rest will emerge at the oral



--- I really mean - 3/100. The worst that can happen for someone like you is you get lost in the trees, can't see the wood, etc. Simplify it down



--- more like a manifesto than a thesis proposal



--- it should be an exploration of ideas though, not a 'here is a list of the ideas I will explore and in this structure'



--- it's something like - I read all this, i learned all this, i care about THIS THIS AND THIS (just 3 things, out of 100!) - here is how I want to move forward



— your question is -what do i think my investment in this field is. what do I want to spend 2-3 years writing about



### pick exactly three big ideas ###



#### more bibliographical than "DH" ####







My use of computational methods is skeptical of the reification of “Digital Humanities” as a discipline. I pursue answers to literary questions via a range of methods, some of which will employ databases, [other things]. However, [rather than focusing on the digitality of my tools], I emphasize the continuity of my approach with, for example, the exhaustive descriptive bibliography of Garside and the empirical quantificaion of St Clair.



##### no longer considering scales as different models #####







My initial thesis proposal proposed approaching my decade of interest by examining three different “models” of different levels of detail: “One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prolifically in the period, often as a means to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms.”



I still anticipate building and comparing multiple ‘models’ of literary activity in the decade, but no longer conceive of this as a division shaped by my textual sources. Instead, I anticipate considering publisher-centric, reader-centric, and author-centric models, each examined at multiple scales of detail.



##### Felski: I want to avoid critique #####







One line of thinking which attempts to sidestep critique is to consider the throughlines of Gothic fiction as providing nourishment for suffering [suffer like a heroine, performative vulnerability, 



#### still want to "account for" everything ####



#### seriousness?? ####







All of these works can be hard to take seriously..



#### false empiricism only affects humanists ####







Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, research in other fields is hard even to identify *as* research. These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don’t easily understand the CS disclaimers.



#### works I love ####







Works I love: Vicar of Wakefield, A Simple Story, Percy?, Old Manor House, Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, some of Coleridge, so much of Keats, Radcliffe 4 eva, UNCLE TOBY, ode on the death of a favourite cat, 1811, Charlotte Smith, Cowper!!, 



Mostly I don’t like… men? But Keats and Gray and Cowper and Sterne and Walpole and Lewis are all ok?



##### authors #####







My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe’s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the ‘School of Radcliffe.’ Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe’s place as a ‘key writer’ for a shift away from the Gothic.



I am unsure about how best to structure my use of ‘key authors’ to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them — especially since one of my key questions is, “how can we appropriately select ‘representatives’ from complex bodies of texts?” 



##### More vs Wordsworth #####







A central tension for me is the sense that Hannah More and William Wordsworth are both falling into similar traps of aestheticizing and moralizing their disdain for the very real distress for those in poverty, and that I nonetheless find Shepherd of Salisbury Plain more palatable than Michael. Michael in its beauties disguises its operations; More is so transparent that it’s easy to simply set aside what is unpalatable and read for the other details.



 



##### works with useful lessons?? #####



#### possible chapters ####







My reading has allowed me to develop more specific hypotheses regarding potential chapters. 







are all my chapters going to be “compare two authors and how they use one genre”?



are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?



if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format (though I could add people who wrote plays!!)



and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?



or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More & Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”



and that’s the one where I talk about my emerging theory of timeliness



or is timeliness not a chapter, but in fact the overarching theme of the whole diss?



##### timeliness #####



##### More & Wordsworth & ballads #####







One potential chapter, for example, might examine Hannah More and William Wordsworth’s varying use of supernatural content and ballad forms as literary tools to “elevate” their readers. This inquiry would consider the authors’ individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth’s 1798 “The Thorn” and More’s 1796 “Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard’s Mill Pond.” It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the “songs” for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.



#### reparative reading ####







I want to both do reparative reading and examine how 18thC audiences might have read reparatively.



I look at literature as something that is always ephemeral and timely, always in a moment that has the potential to be momentous — a play and a song and a novel all have their own ways of occupying the lives of their audiences.



Uses and practices around / with texts



Texts as trying to encourage particular uses, reaching out to particular readers —but not able to control those uses (seriousness always on the verge of parody)



##### trying to take advice from the texts themselves #####







The 18thC debate about the appropriate uses of feeling, its contradictions with rational philosophy but also its necessity, is — what I care about also



##### eve sedgwick #####







"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."



"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."



#### worried about contrariness ####







Some level of my interest in Hannah More and disinterest in Wordsworth stems from a basic contrariness that I don’t think is the best motivation



#### I'm reading a lot of disreputable stuff ####







My reading list mixes canonical masterpieces with rubbish like “The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain” and “Almagro & Claude.” I… don’t think these things are better than the “good stuff,” though I do often appreciate their honesty.

Gamer’s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of ‘high’ Romantic literature and ‘low,’ popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that “gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic’s reception” (37), to argue that “gothic’s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms” (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.



#### Romantic misfits ####







“The first [group of ‘misfits’] was excluded from literary history in order to secure the status of those writers who did ‘fit’ (the ‘Romantics’) even as the Romantics themselves based their claim to high literary status on their status as misfits-- on their success in transcending the literary marketplace to which other writers were represented as in thrall (because fitting too well).” (5)







“there are recurring themes, such as the manner in which the ‘structural transformation of the public sphere’ during the Romantic era is itself an integral aspect of the story of how ‘high’ literature was constructed at the expense of the ‘low’ (where ‘public engagement’ becomes a defining feature of the ‘low’, and self-cultivation a quality of ‘high’).” (6) — nowadays we value public engagement; at the time, politics/ethics was publicly engaged…?







	•	“As I see the literary culture of the period, there is a dialectical play between the radical Enlightenment and its counter. But instead of seeing the period Balkanized into three generations, with the first and last favoring ‘enlightenment modes’ and the middle settling into ‘reaction’ (or ‘Counter-Enlightenment’), I detect a constant dialectical play between these two poles that were subjectivities as much as they were political positions and, as a consequence, also stubbornly resistant to rational argument. This dialectical play is driven less by the French Revolution and more by the historical rupture it was seen to constitute. … The sense of crisis induced by the first intimation of ‘global synchronicity’, linked to the yawning question of what now did legitimate state authority, profoundly marks the literary production of the Romantic era. The Enlightenment modes that survive in the 1790s differ substantially from those that reappear ten and fifteen years later, and they differ dialectically.” (11) 







#### David Brewer abstract ####







The recent quantitative turn in literary studies has reminded us of the breadth and variety of the literary field of the past. In so doing, however, it has necessarily levelled out the felt distinctions between various texts, and so risks working against the very sort of literary history that its new vistas promise: one which does justice to the workings of form across time and space. In particular, the presumptive interchangeability of texts that is required to put them into a series susceptible to quantitative analysis ignores the massively different footprint left by commercially successful (and socially canonical) texts as we move beyond their moment of initial publication. Evelina, for example, may have been just another novel of 1778 when it first appeared, but it loomed far above all other productions of that year a decade later (or anywhere beyond the metropole). Such footprints, I argue, changed the significance of their texts’ form, making it seem richer, thicker, more resonant or definitive—perhaps, for some, more stifling or oppressive—than that of their apparently similar but less successful counterparts.

#### what to teach: convo with Jack copy ####







From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:







1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."







1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.







2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).







2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.







I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.







Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.







So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???

Reforming Gothic readers: repurposing the supernatural in William Wordsworth’s and Hannah More’s ballads



Big picture: Scholars like Michael Gamer have increasingly been attentive to the importance of the Gothic to Romanticism, [something about “bad readers” / popular literature]] [lyric introspection is seen as in conversation with a something else]



Gap in literature: Often don’t look at materials which are actually aimed at “bad readers”? (contemporary rather than presumed-ancient ballads?)



My project filling the gap: Hannah More!



Specific material: I read Wordsworth’s lyrical ballad “The Thorn” against More’s chapbook ballad “Robert and Richard.” Both works promise a ghost story that they then refuse to deliver satisfactorily. Wordsworth puts “The Thorn” into the mouth of a speaker eager for a thrilling story, but centres its narrative around the harm caused by this self-fulfilling thirst for the salacious. More titles her work “Robert and Richard, Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who was Drowned in Richard’s Mill Pond” to compete in the marketplace against genuine ghost stories, but sidelines her ghost in favour of a didactic religious message. In their own ways, then, both authors make use of Gothic materials in an attempt to reform Gothic readers. However, although More is the only one to introduce an unabiguously real ghost, she is also the only one to fully refuse the Gothic thrills that she and Wordsworth disavow.



[I contextualize these two poems within a broader publishing context of ballads and the supernatural, to show important stakes for a bigger conversation.]

Create a csv with the following columns:
	from within FILEDESC tags:
		IDNO DLPS
		IDNO ESTC
		IDNO DocNo
		IDNO TCP
		IDNO GaleDocNo
	from within PUBLICATIONSTMT tags
		TITLE
		AUTHOR
		PUBPLACE
		PUBLISHER
		

For every file in the folder "ECCO-TCP-headers",
	If we're inside FILEDESC,
		If we find an IDNO tag,
			Check the tag's "type" against my list
			Record the contents of the tag in the appropriate column of the csv
	If we're inside PUBLICATIONSTMT tags,
		If we find one of the four tags I want,
			Record the contents of the tag in the appropriate column of the csv

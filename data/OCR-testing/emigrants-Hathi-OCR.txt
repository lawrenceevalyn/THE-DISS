T O WILLIAM com/PER, Ess. DEAR SIR, THERE is, I hope, ſome propriety in my addreſſing a Com- poſition to you, which would never perhaps have exiſted, had I not, amid the beavy preſſure of many ſorrows, derived infinite conſolation from your Poetry, and ſome degree of animation and of confidence from your ºfteem. The following performance is far from aſpiring to be con- ſidered as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, “ The “TAsk;” I am perfºy fººl, that it belongs not to a feeble and feminine band to draw the Bow of Ulyſſes. The force, clearneſ, andſublimity of your admirable Poem; the felicity, almoſt peculiar to your genius, of giving to the moſt familiar obječís dignity and effečf, I could never hope to 3. - reach

A Dedication uſually conſiſts of praiſes and of apologies ; my praiſe can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applauſ: of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the few, who, at the preſent period, reſcue her from the imputa- tion of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the form of Apology, I ſhould have much to ſay, if I again dared to plead the preſſure of evils, aggravated by their long conti- nuance, as an excuſe for the defects ºf this attempt. JWhatever

Tet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of the Engliſh, this national averſion has acquired new force by the dreadful ſcenes which have been atted in France during 2 2 the

Perhaps even the Author of “The Taſº,” with all Air good- neſ; and tenderneſs of Áeart, is in the catalogue of thoſ, who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cauſe, which it was once the glory of Engliſhmen to avow and defend- The exquiſite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her ſincereſt friends, was publiſhed ſºme years before the demolition of regal dºſpotiſm in France, which, in the fifth book, it ſtems fo º s

Adverſity has now taught them the charity and humility they perhaps wanted, when they made it a part of their faith, that ſalvation could be obtained in no other religion than their own. * “The ſplendid palaces.”]—Let it not be confidered as an inſult to men in fallen fortune, if theſe luxuries (undoubtedly inconſiſtent with their profeſfion) be here enumerated—France is not the only country, where the ſplendour and indulgences of the higher, and the poverty and depreſſion of the inferior Clergy, have alike proved injurious to the cauſe of Religion. * See the finely deſcriptive Verſes written at Montauban in France in 1750, by Dr. Joſeph Warton. Printed in Dodſley's Miſcellanies, Vol. IV. page 203. 5 “ Who amid the ſons “ Of Reaſon, Valour, Liberty, and Virtue, E 2 “ Diſplays

Yet let me here add, what ſeems to be in ſome degree inconfiſtent with the former charge, that the French are good maſters to their ſervants, and that in their treatment of their Negro ſlaves, they are allowed to be more mild and merciful than other Europeans. * “But more the Men.”]—The Financiers and Fermiers Generaux are here intended. In the preſent moment of clamour againſt all thoſe who have ſpoken or written in favour of the firſt Revolution of France, the declaimers ſeem to have forgotten, that under the reign of a mild and eaſy tempered Monarch, in the moſt voluptuous Court in the world, the abuſes by which men of this deſcription were enriched, had ariſen to ſuch height, that their prodigality exhauſted the immenſe reſources of France: and, unable to ſupply the exigencies of Government, the Miniſtry were compelled to call Le Tiers Etat; a meeting that gave birth to the Revolu- tion, which has ſince been ſo ruinouſly condućted. * “The breaſt of Patriot Virtue.”]—This ſentiment will probably renew againſt me the indignation of thoſe, who have an intereſt in aſſerting that no ſuch virtue any where exiſts.

The peaſants frequently miſled them; and, after having paſſed theſe inundations at the hazard of their lives, they were ſometimes under the neceſſity of croſſing them a ſecond and a third time; their evening quarters after ſuch a day of exertion were often in a wood without ſhelter; and their repaſt, inſtead of bread, unripe corn, without any other preparation than being maſhed into a ſort of paſte. * The

THE EM IGRANTS,,A POE M,,IN TWO BOOKS.,BY CHARLOTTE SMITH.,LONDON: PRINTED FOR T. CADELL, IN THE STRANDI,1793.
TO WILLIAM COWPER, Es DEAR SIR, THERE is,- I hope, some propriety in my addrefing a Com- potion to you, which would,never perhaps have existed, had I not, amid the heavy prefure of many sorrows, derived infinite consolation from your Poetry, and some degree of animation and of confidencefrom your efieen. . 'he.following performance isfarfrom aspiring to be con- fidered as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, " THE " TASK;" I am perfeetly sensible, that it belongs not to a feeble andfemninine hand to draw the Bow of Ulyfes.,Theforce, clearness, and sublimity ofyour admirable Poem; the felicity, almost peculiar to your genius, of givingto the moJ familiar objegls dignity and eset, I could never hope to,a reach
[ vi ] reach; yet, having read" The TaJk" almojf inceantly from its frft publication to the present time, Ifelt that kind of enchantment described by Milton, when be fays,,The Angel ended, and in Adam's tar " So charming left his vwce, that he awhile , Tisught him Jlillfpeaking."-- And from the force of this imprefion, I was gradually led to attempt, in Blank Verse, a delineation of those interesting ob- jecis which happened to excite my attention, and which even prefed upon an heart, that has learned, perhaps from its own fuferings, tofeel with acute, though unavailing compafion, the calamity of others.,A Dedication usually confJfs of praises and of apologies; my praise can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applause of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the few, who, at the present period, rescue herfrom the imputa- tin of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the form of Apology, IJlould have much to ay, if I again dared to plead the preffre of evils, aggravated by their long conti- nuance, as an excufefor the defegs of this attempt.,Whatever
[ vii ] Whatever may be thefaults of its execution, let me vindi- cate myfelffrom those, that may be imputed to the design.- In fpeaking-of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be underfioodas feeling the utmoJf refpealfor the integrity of their principles; and it is with pleasure I add my suffrage to that of those, who have had afimilar opportunity of witnefing the conduEt of the Emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in Eng- land; which has been such as does honour to their nation, and ought tofecure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal mind.,Your philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, am per- fuaded, to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred so unworthy of great and enlightened nations; that it may tend to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good qualities exiJt in the other; and at length annihilate the pre- judices that havefo long exiled to the injury of both.,ret it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of the Englijh, this national aversion has acquired newforce by the dreadful fenes which have been agted in France during,a 2 the
[ viii ] the las fummer-even those who are the viblims of' the Revolution, have not escaped the odium, which the undtifin- guiJhing multitude annex to all the natives of a country where such horrors have been agted: nor is this the worfl eset those events have bad on the minds of the Englijh; by confounding the original cause with the wretched cataflrophes that have followed its ill management; the attempts of public virtue, with the outrages that guilt andfolly have committed in its di&fgui, the very name of Liberty has not only loft the charm it used to have in Britii/h ears, but many, who have written, orfpoken, in its defence, have been Jiigmatized as promoters of Anarchy, and enemies to the prosperity of their country. Perhaps even the Author of "c The Task," with all hisgood- noes and tenderness of heart, is in the catalogue of those, who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause, -which it was once the glory of Englijhmen to avow and defend,. The exquifte Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her fincereJ l friends, was published Joine years before the demolition of regal defpotfiSfm France, which, 'ii the fifth haok, itfeems,to
I ix ] to foretell-All the truth and energy of the pafage to which I allude, mufj have beenJlronglyfelt, when, in the Parlia- ment of England, the greatest Orator of our time quoted the fublimefJ of our Poets-when the eloquence of Fox didjuilice to the genius of Cowper.,Iam, dear SIR,,With the rmnt iffga erJef.,.. .,Your obligel and obfditerfevat,,CH¢RLOTTE SMITH. .ighthflmJnflayW J 179. -

THE EMIGRANTS. BOOK THE FIRST.
BOOK I. SCENE, on the Clijs to the EaJward of the Towii of,Brighthelnmtone in Suflex. TIME, a Morning in November, 1792. SLOW in the Wintry Morn, the struggling light Throws a faint gleam upon the troubled waves; Their foaming tops, as they approach the shore And the broad surf that never ceasing breaks On the innumerous pebbles, catch the beams Of the pale Sun, that with reluctance gives To this cold northern Ife, its fhorten'd day. Alas ! how few the morning wakes to joy ! How many murmur at oblivious night For leaving them so soon; for bearing thus,B Their
[23 Their fancied bliss (the only bliss they taste !), On her black wings away !-Changing the dreams That footh'd their sorrows, for calamities (And every day brings its own fad proportion) For doubts, diseases, abjeLc dread of Death, And faithless friends, and fame and fortune loft; Fancied or real wants; and wounded pride, That views the day star, but to curse his beams.,Yet He, whose Spirit into being call'd This wond'roas World of Waters; He who bids The wild wind lift them till they dalih he clouds, And speaks to them in thunder; ,or whofe'breath, Low murmuring o'er the gently heaving tides, When the fair Moon, in summer night serene, Irradiates with long trembling lines of light Their undulating surface; that great Power,,Who
[' 3 T Who, governing the Planets,' also knows If but a Sea-Mew falls, whose nest is hid In these incumbent cliffs; He surely means To us, his reasoning Creatures, whom He bids Acknowledge and revere his awful.hand, Nothing but good: Yet Man, misguided Man, Mars the fair work. that.he was bid enjoy, And makes himself the evil he deplores. How often, when my weary foul recoils From proud opprefion, and from legal crimes (For such are in this Land, where the vain boast Of equal Law is mockery, while the colt Of seeking for redress is sure to plunge Th' already injur'd to more certain ruin And the wretch starves, before his Counsel pleads) How often doI. half abjure Society,,B 2 And
s 4 1 And sigh for some lone Cottage, deep embower'd In the green woods, that there steep chalky Hills Guard from the strong South Weft; where round their base The Beach wide flourishes, and the light Aih With slender leaf half hides the thymy turf!- There do I wish to hide me; well content If on the short grass, strewn with fairy flowers, I might repose thus lhelter'd; or when Eve In Orient crimson lingers in the weft, Gain the high mound, and mark these waves remote (Lucid the' distant), blushing with the rays Of the far-flaming Orb, that finks beneath-them; For I have thought, that I should then behold The beauteous works of God, unfpoil'd by Man And less affeated then, by human woes I witnefs'd not might better learn to bear,Those
Those that injustice, and duplicity And faithlessness and folly, fix on me; For never yet could I derive relief, When my fwol'n heart was bursting with its sorrows> From the fad thought, that others like myself Live but to swell affliaion's countless tribes ! -Tranquil seclusion I have vainly fought; Peace, who delights in solitary lhade, No more will spread for me her downy wings, But, like the fabled Danaids-or the wretch, Who ceaseless, up the steep acclivity, Was doom'd to heave the till rebounding rock, Onward I labour; as the baffled wave, Which yon rough beach repulses, that returns With the next breath of wind, to fail again.- Ah I Mourner-ceafe these wailings: cease and learn,,That
[6 That not the Cot fequefter'd, where the briar And wood-bine wild, embrace the moify thatch, (Scarce seen amid the forest gloom obscure!) Or more substantial farm, well fenced and warm, Where the full barn, and cattle fodder'd round Speak rustic plenty; nor the statelier dome By dark firs shaded, or the aspiring pine, Close by the village Church (with care conceal'd By verdant foliage, left the poor man's grave Should mar the smiling profpe& of his Lord), Where offices well rang'd, or dove-cote ftock'd, Declare manorial residence; not these Or any of the buildings, new and trim With windows circling towards the restless Sea, Which ranged in rows, now terminate my walk, Can (hut out for an hour the fpe&re Care,,That
7 3 That from the dawn of reason, follows still Unhappy Mortals, 'till the friendly grave (Our sole secure asylum) " ends the chace'.",Behold, in witness of this mournful truth, A group approach me, whose deje&ed looks, Sad Heralds of distress ! proclaim them Men Banilh'd for ever and for conrcience fake From their diftrated Country, whence the name Of Freedom misapplied, and much abus'd By lawless Anarchy, has driven them far To wander; with the prejudice they learn'd From Bigotry (the Tut'refs of the blind), Thro" the wide World unfhelter'd; their sole hope, That German spoilers, thro' that pleasant land May carry wide the .desolating 'scourge Of War and Vengeance; yet unhappy Men,,Whate'er
Whate'er your errors, I lament your fate: And, as disconsolate and fad ye hang Upon the barrier of the rock, and seem To murmur your despondence, waiting long Some fortunate reverse that never comes; Methinks in each expressive face, I fee Discriminated anguish; there droops one, Who in a moping cloister long confum'd This life inacive, to obtain a better, And thought that meagre abstinence, to wake From his hard pallet with the midnight bell, To live on eleemosynary bread, And to renounce God's works, would please that God. And now the poor pale wretch receives, amaz'd, The pity, strangers give to his distress, Because these strangers are, by his dark creed,,Condemn'd
E '7 J Condemn'd as Heretics-and with sick heart Regrets his pious prison, and his beads.- Another, of more haughty port, declines The aid he needs not; while in mute despair His high indignant thoughts go back to France, Dwelling on all he loft-the Gothic dome, That vied with splendid palaces'; the beds Of silk and down, the silver chalices, Vestments with gold enwrought for blazing altars; Where, amid clouds ofincenfe, he:held forth To kneeling crowds:the imaginary bones Of Saints fuppos'd, in pearl and gold enchas'd, And still with more than living Monarchs' pomp Surrounded,; was believ'd by mumbling bigots To hold the keys of Heaven, and to admit Whom he thought good to liare it-Now alas !,C He
[ I8 ] He, to whose daring foul and high ambition The World feem'd circumfcrib'd; who, wont to dream. Of Fleuri, Richelieu, Alberoni, men Who trod on Empire, and whose politics Were not beyond the grasp of his vast mind, Is, in a Land once hostile, till prophan'd By disbelief, and rites un-orthodox, The obje& of compaffion-At his fide, Lighter of heart than these, but heavier far Than he was wont, another victim comes, An Abbe-who with less contracted brow Still smiles and flatters, and itill talks of Hope; Which, sanguine as he is, he does not feel, And so he cheats the fad and weighty pressure Of evils present;-- Still, as Men misled By early prejudice (so hard to break),,I mourn
[ 19 ] I mourn your sorrows; for I too have known Involuntary exile; and while yet England had charms for me, have felt how fad It is to look.acrofs the dim cold sea, That melancholy rolls its refluent tides Between us and the dear regretted land We call our own-as now ye pensive wait On this bleak morning, gazing on the waves That teem to leave your ihore; from whence the wind Is loaded to your ears, with the deep groans Of martyr'd Saints and suffering Royalty, While to your eyes the avenging power of Heaven Appears in aweful anger to prepare The form of vengeance, fraught with plagues and death. Even he of milder heart, who was indeed The simple ihepherd in a rustic scene,,C And

He glided thro' the dim arch'd avenue Which to the Caffle led; hoping to cheer The last fad hour of some laborious life That hasten'd to its clofe-even such a Man Becomes an exile; flaying not to try . By temperate zeal to'check his madd'ning flock, Who, at the.novel found of Liberty (Ah! most intoxicating found to saves !), Start into licence-Lo! dejeted now, The wandering Pastor mourns, with bleeding heart, His erring people, weeps and prays for them, And trembles for the account that he must give To Heaven for fouls entrusted to his care.- Where the-cliff, hollow'd by the wintry storm, Affords a feat with matted sea-weed strewn, A softer form reclines; around her run,,On
[ 22 ] On the rough hfingles, or the chalky bourn, Her gay unconscious children, soon amus'd; Who pick the fretted stone, or glossy shell, Or crimson plant marine: or they contrive The fairy vessel, with its ribband fail And gilded paper pennant: in the pool, Left by the salt wave on the yielding sands, They launch the mimic navy-Happy age! Unmindful of the miseries of Man !- Alas! too long a victim to distress, Their Mother, loft in melancholy thought, Lull'd for a moment by the murmurs low Of fallen billows, wearied by the talk Of having here, with fwol'n and aching eyes Six'd on the grey horizon, since the dawn Solicitously watch'd the weekly fail,From

Versailles appears-its painted galleries, And rooms of regal splendour; rich with gold, Where, by long mirrors multiply'd, the crowd Paid willing homage-and, united there, Beauty gave charms to empire-Ah ! too soon From the gay visionary pageant rous'd, See the fad mourner tfart !-and, drooping, look With tearful eyes and heaving bosom round On drear reality-where dark'ning waves, Urg'd by the rising wind, unheeded foam Near her cold rugged feat:-To call her thence A fellow-fufferer comes: dejection deep Checks, but conceals not quite, the martial air,,And

NOTES To THE FIRST BOOK. " ENDS the chace."]-I have a confuted notion, that this expression, with nearly the fame application, is to be found in Young: but I cannot refer to it.," Regrets his pious prison and his beads."]-Left the fame attempts at misrepresentation ihould now be made, as have been made on former occasions, it is necessary to repeat, that nothing is farther from my thoughts, than to refle& invidioully on the Emigrant Clergy, whose fteadi- ness of principle excites veneration, as much as their sufferings compassion. Adversity has now taught them the charity and humility they perhaps wanted, when they made it a part of their faith, that salvation could be obtained in no other religion than their own. 3 " The splendid palaces."]-Let it not be confidered as an insult to men in fallen fortune, if these luxuries (undoubtedly inconsistent with their profession) he here enumerated-France is not the only country, where the splendour and indulgences of the higher, and the poverty and depression of the inferior Clergy, have alike proved injurious to the cause of Religion. 4 See the finely descriptive Verses written at Montauban in France in 1750, by Dr. Joseph Wartoh; Printed in Dodfley's Miscellanies, Vol. IV.. page 203.,5 A Who amid the sons ' Of Reason, Valour, Liberty, and Virtue,,E 2 "Displays
[ 36 3 c Displays distinguished merit, is a Noble "c Of Nature's own creation."]- There lines are Thomson's, and are among those sentiments which are now called (when used by living writers), not common-place declamation, but sentiments of dangerous tendency. 6 c" Exalt not from the crowd."]-It has been said, and with great ap- pearance of truth, that the contempt in which the Nobility of France held the common people, was remembered, and with all that vindictive asperity which long endurance of opprefflon naturally excites, when, by a wonderful concurrence of circumstances, the people acquired the power of retaliation. Yet let me here add, what seems to be in some degree inconsistent with the former charge, that the French are good masters to their servants, and that in their treatment of their Negro flves, they are allowed to-be more mild and merciful than other Europeans. 7 " But more the Men."]-The Financiers and Fermiers Generaux are here intended. In the present moment of clamour against. all those who have spoken or written in favour of the first Revolution of France, the declaimers seem to have forgotten, that-under the reign of a mild and easy tempered Monarch, in the most voluptuous Court in the world, the abuses by which men of this description were enriched, had arisen to such height, that their prodigality exhausted the immense refources:of France and, unable to supply the exigencies of Government, the Ministry were compelled to call Le Tiers Etat i a meeting that gave birth to the Revolu. tion, which has ince been so ruinously conducted.," The breast of Patriot Virtue."]-This.fentiment will probably rene£w against me the indignation of those, who have an interest in asserting thai no such virtue any where exists.,THE

And if, where regulated fandity Pours her long orisons to Heaven, my voice Was seldom heard, that yet my prayer, was made To him who hears even silence; not in domes Of human architecure, fill'd with crowds, But on these hills, where boundless, yet diftint, Even as a map, beneath are spread the fields His bounty cloaths; divided here by woods,,And

While I might breathe the air perfum'd with flowers, Or the fresh odours of the mountain turf; And gaze on clouds above me, as they.fail'd Majestic: or remark the reddening north, When bickering arrows of electric fire Flash on the evening fky-I made my prayer In unison with murmuring waves that now Swell with dark tempests, now are mild and blue, As the bright arch above; for all to me Declare omniscient goodness; nor need I Declamatory essays to incite My wonder or my praise, when every leaf That Spring unfolds, and every simple bud, More forcibly impresses on my heart His power and wifdom-Ah I while I adore That goodness, which defign'd to all that lives,Some

Then shall these ill-ftarr'd wanderers, whose fad fate These desultory lines lament, regain Their native country; private vengeance then To public virtue yield; and the fierce feuds, That long have torn their desolated land, May (even as torms, that agitate the air, Drive noxious vapours from the blighted earth) Serve, all tremendous as they are, to fix The reign of Reason, Liberty, and Peace !,NOTES

The peasants frequently miffed them; and, after having paired these inundations at the hazard of their lives, they were sometimes under the necessity of crossing them a second and a third time; their evening quarters after such a day of exertion were often in a wood without mhelter; and their repast, instead of bread, unripe corn, without any other preparation than being mashed into a fort of paste.,"The

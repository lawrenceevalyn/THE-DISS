Adam Hammond
in the hype cycle, distant reading is sliding into the trough of dissilusionment
accusation that digital methods are tied to the neoliberalization of the university, and that impetus comes top-down because administrators like the corporatiztion of it

the nature of DH results: how to evaluate them? why is it so difficult to produce great results?

next key task: validation
two moments in research process when validation is crucial:
1, whether tools are working correctly
2, whether conclusions drawn from tools are sound

validating tools
Erez Aiden Uncharted: Big Data as a Lens on Human Culture - picks a lot of low-hanging fruit, makes a lot of messianic claims; the kind of book to push back against .. though the key point of the book is to show that the tool works, not to make humanities discoveries; first kind of validation

"daa illustrating a truism rather than discovering a truth ... we wouldn't think to search for those names in that time period unless we knew what we were going to find, and why"

Hammond's book had made a lot of claims about word usage that he was anxious to check with the ngram viewer; it was useful validation of the second type that ngrams confirmed their findings

"war humps": some words increase arround WWI and WWII, so you can just mess around trying words to see if they do -- discover new trends

once we know that the tool itself works, we can do a lot with it

validating results
pioneering studies put themselves out there, grab low-hanging fruit -- but therefore also very open to critique

it's important to find something new that violates preconceptions to produce new knowledge

Literary Lab finds emotional words reduced, "hard seed" function words increased
theory: go from telling to showing
but Underwood then showed a decrease in latinate roots and increase in anglo-saxon, and all the "hard seed" words were anglo-saxon -- so the telling/showing theory is not validated

Ways Out of the Double Bind
- interdisciplinary collaboration and adaptation are important
"using models of lexical style" the six-dimensional approach to literary style
- they are also HARD ... hard to sustain over time

T.L. Cowan

online archive and anecdotal encyclopedia for trans, feminist, and queer artists, acticists and audiences

as they worked, realised that throwing all these materials online was to take something intended for an intimate in-group and expose it problematically outside that community
-- even the publicity materials for Meow Mix, for example, were always coded and hidden in "women seeking women" ads

so... how do you get permission for a community?
right now, no idea; have copyright permission from legal holders, but the site is still password protected
trying to include everyone in every material, plus conversation about what it means to public -- legal guidelines are the floor, not the ceiling, of ethics and accountability

community knowledges are not knowledges that one person can give permission to circulate. how do we decolonize queer, feminist, trans knowledges?
paradox: believe in the scholarly social value of circulating these materials, but also believe that to do so puts the people creating it in harm's way
not only the threat of violence that is a potential harm -- also the harm of being exposed in the public eye

queer performance meant to be interacted with by those within its epistemological sphere while evaporating at the touch of those who would eliminate queer history

... somehow pursue the camp and flamboyant, those parts which are defiantly visible?

we think of a tweet as a text, rather than a community conversation -- and when we shift our thinking, our ethical obligations change

mukurtu traditional knowledge attribution label

understnd publicity not in terms of the need for safety and protection but in terms of a space where it is safe to be vulnerable and not be attacked

DH in Islamic studies

A huge number of sources / websites, but because of ideological splits none are comprehensive, archives are fragmented

Ragheb describing ideologically motivated decisions about what to digitize in medieval Islamic studies, and how they fragment the archival record: feels like an easier-to-spot version of archival gaps in the archives I work with

Q&A

Twitter terms of service are very clear that tweets are global and public: how to respond?
ToS (like copyright) are a floor, not a ceiling -- trying to think beyond templates, and think in context
not just ethics, but methodology, understanding actual source of text

To do this work well, you need to combine archives. But how can you combine archives well and ethically?
Stanford Literary Lab won't share or tell you about their corpus
-- is my dissertation in part about building a database that can bring together disparate sources...?
-- can I get my collaborators to help me with this? can I do it myself??
--- need to have space for multiple "versions" of each text, that can variously combine or separate them (do I have to build this ontology?)

surveillance
the more you learn about something as seemingly boring as twitter's API, the more you realize vulnerabilities and important poltical and ethical lessons


--- want to be able to attach qualitative assesments, join sheets etc... I think I need a relational database

Kenzie Burchell

avoiding the simplistic categorization of "fake news" to see more complex media interference strategies
- reducing sources
- strategically disseminating media

Database comparison as knowledge production

ISIS: military occupation to secure particular sites, then kidnapping and executing journalists to prevent coverage of what is happening, but then also release of online execution videos to seize attention of western media

A pattern that also happened at Sochi Olympics, invasion of Crimea, Chechnyan killings of gay men

What's wrong with "fake news"? accusations that west is politicizing the news becomes the news itself
Putin's denial of Crimean invasion became the news story, instead of the reality of the invasion being the news story -- the problem isn't that the news is fake, it's that it's strategically manipulated


how do you study things that didn't make it to the news, by studying the news?

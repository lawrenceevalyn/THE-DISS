## State as clearly and as specifically as possible the scope and method of the inquiry as well as the relationship of the topic to present scholarship in the field.

How and why are canons created? How are they used?

The uses of Shakespeare!
* Radcliffe's use of Shakespearean canon legitimates the Gothic as having an English literary history. (Which work had all the epigraphs?)
* Keymer argues that Shakespearean quotations became trite commonplaces, and everybody quoted the same bits that appeared in books of extracts.
* Imitations and amendments of Shakespeare abounded: to what extent are these "Shakespeare"? Are they used differently?

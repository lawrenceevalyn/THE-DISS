## State as clearly and as specifically as possible the scope and method of the inquiry as well as the relationship of the topic to present scholarship in the field.

London popular media, 1789-1800. (Or 1816??)

Look at authors who use many genres: Elizabeth Inchbald, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, Matthew Lewis, Samuel Coleridge, Ann Radcliffe. (Fanny Burney? Joanna Baillie? Who were the popular poets and essayists?)

My first step will be to correlate enormous bibliographical information in order to pick authors, and my second step will be to re-contextualize and then read fucktons of writing.

My goal will be to better articulate how individual writers use the mediums they choose, how the popular conversation conducts itself in response to the French Revolution, and how popular "mass" movements compare to their "representative" texts.

What will make all this "DH-y"?

## 10-15 items that register the methodological / theoretical / critical priorities of the thesis project

1. **Algee-Hewitt, Mark. "Acts of Aesthetics: Publishing as Recursive Agency in the Long Eighteenth Century." *Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net* 57-8 (2010). Web.** "Of primary concern to late eighteenth-century society was the sheer volume of printed work being produced in England. The response of authors troubled by this perceived crisis was an outpouring of works on taste, aesthetics, genre and literature... Yet this response itself, of course, only added to the number of works within Britain. ... This essay outlines a potential solution to this problem by sampling a highly focused selection of digitized texts that raise the issue of over-publication. Through a quantitative analysis of these texts, it identifies the lexical patterns that may reveal the ways in which authors of the period envisioned the work of aesthetics. In particular, this article identifies an emerging consensus on how printed objects became agents within the socio-cultural world of the long eighteenth century: both as objects which could act on readers and as objects which could act on other printed texts."

1. **Worrall, David. *Celebrity, Performance, Reception: British Georgian Theatre as Social Assemblage.* Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2013 Print.** From Amy Garnai's review: The idea of “social assemblage,” originating in the work of philosopher Manuel De Landa, theorizes social structures and networks and the material forces and complexities that underpin them. Worrall adapts De Landa’s insights specifically to theatre with the proposition that “all physical spaces, locations and embodiments of performance are expressive and comprise population components within a connected social network or assemblage of production and reception." ... In its use of a methodological framework that is new to theatre studies, in its privileging of the quantitative methods of analysis associated with this theory, and especially in Worrall’s impressive historical research and thorough engagement with archival sources, Celebrity, Performance, Reception is essential reading for scholars of the Georgian theatre.

- It is likely that I will want to access materials that are not readily available in scholarly editions, but I will not know what those are (or where I'll find them) until after I've done an initial phase of reading a lot of bibliographies.

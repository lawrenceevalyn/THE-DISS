My discussion of Dorothy Wordsworth and Charlotte Smith above also has implications for possible restructuring of these anthologies, but of course, shuffling around a few authors does not address the core problem of \cb1 the small and highly clustered network of \'93notable\'94 writers which I argue is to be lost with distant reading\cb3 . The question of anthology and teaching is not one to be solved here, or it would be solved already; there are real and compelling reasons for anthologies to be organized the way they {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E443AF05-459C-4F31-A633-2A67CD4B333B"}}{\fldrslt are.}} The \'93canon\'94 has always been an artificial invention to serve the needs and agendas of those who construct it. What this means is not that it is useless, but that we should thoughtfully begin again each time we find that our needs and agendas change. My priorities discussed here move away from the self-defined central concepts of Romanticism, particularly that of the individual genius. The alternative remains unclear. I am inspired by Katherine Bode\'92s call for scholarly editions of literary systems, and intrigued by Philip Cox\'92s strictly chronological edition of Keats\'92 works which mixes letters and poems. My instinct is to step backward, view as many things at once as possible, and begin again from the ground up \'97 which brings me to distant reading.}

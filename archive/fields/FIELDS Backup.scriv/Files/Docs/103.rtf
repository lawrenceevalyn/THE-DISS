One of the most explicit lessons that Emily St Aubert learns during the novel is that her initial preferred strategy of appeasement is not the correct one, and that she must develop an inner resistance to the evils she encounters. [Advises Madame Cheron to sign over her papers to avoid death; it seems that appeasement has been vindicated when Madame Cheron dies.] [But then Emily attempts to appease Montoni herself, and it backfires horribly.] [Rather than submitting to her misfortunes with good grace, Emily learns to see them as tyranny being exercised against her.]  [Tyranny is as immovable as god\'92s will; the correct answer is still passivity, but with a careful boundary drawn around one\'92s own mind.] [It\'92s still true that, as Wakefield says \'93None but the guilty can be long and completely miserable\'94; Udolpho adds to this \'93[its own quote]\'94]}

Mom:

"I think that ngrams might help... will work on it next week (March
Break) if that helps.  Send me a copy of the Excel file with the data
you have and, for the first few entries, what output you'd want...
Mom"

Dad:
"Very interesting problem.  Besides n-grams, I think something that ignores upper/lower case, punctuation and spaces and looks at the edit distance between strings might give you what you want."

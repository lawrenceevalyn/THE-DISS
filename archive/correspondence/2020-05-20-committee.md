#1. Comments from committee on existing writing
##Terry’s notes
Title change: loss of politics, new phrase canonical corpora. The 1790s are so strongly tied to French Revolution that politics might still be an interesting word. Are these corpora conceived of as canonical?
Definitions of popular -- “If it were defined as X, then according to the ESTC…”
Also unpack the word “normal” as a thing I’m trying to understand -- spend more time on these terms
Has corpus-building become the new canon-building?
Terry’s use is as reference sources, not as a representative of an ideal whole. Always a degree of skepticism.
Something to develop with much more detail and precision -- DH scholars make this move of assuming these things, and act like it’s inevitable, but other fields of scholarship never have
Also expand on what the word “canonical” is doing
Why this decade?
I wanted a short time period, and I liked the Gothic… Affective identification with the material is allowed
One of the implications of this mode of exploration is that I can’t have too many preconceptions about what I’ll find, so I tried to pick a period that seemed likely to have something interesting
Play with the idea of the digital revolution? Challenging the simplicity of people’s assumptions about the digital revolution
Profusion of print in this decade
Revolution -> print culture in revolution -> revolutionary women writers -> and then I am interested in Charlotte Smith in particular
Page 4 is very jumpy -- Smith has a long history of contentious reception -- pull out these details. To get to reviewing culture more smoothly. Be more specific about why she might have fallen out of favor in the 19thC.
Have a first section “from canon to corpus”? From “the problem of valuing literature” -- begin with the idea of the canon, how it’s been constructed historically, which gets into reviewing culture
Why Charlotte Smith?
Many other women are prolific.
Questions of genre on p 30 -- “Is it all to do with inherent qualities of genre, or is it more to do with the expectations we as readers bring to different genres?” -- what exactly is this question? What about Smith and genre is making sense to me here?
Still need to spend more time on the current state of Romanticism -- not to dismiss that field of scholarship wrongly.
Rhetorically, rather than saying “The Criticism Does This,” to say “there’s a certain mode in the field whereby people say things like this” and just footnote a list
##Notes from Alex in chat
* Maybe politics as a way to handle the materials in chapter 3
* The words 'canon' and 'popular' have worried us for months you'll be pleased to know. I just made Julie Mattison write a whole section bc she used the word "normal" like that
* I think Terry is right: I tend to assume they are scrappy and a bit loose around the edges etc
* I should have recalled that - thank goodness for committees
* what is a canon, versus what is a corpus: so Bourdieu and Guillory - but then, how a corpus is different
* you could actually consider the difference between the etymologies - canon is canon law and corpus is the cool stuff from italian humanism via Cicero about textual bodies

##Tom’s overall notes
It’s a good idea to junk the other writers. Contain Charlotte Smith rather than try to bring her through the whole dissertation? She doesn’t seem to have a place in chs 3 and 4?
Parts of the dissertation still seem to presuppose the old structure, especially about social standings of different authors, etc. Are they still relevant?
What’s possibly missing is what the consequences are of a databases skewing one way or another. What kinds of work are people doing that then get deformed or rendered inaccurate? Tend to generalize too much about what scholars are doing, and write as if all users of these corpora are DH people, whereas many just use them to consult.
Carol Percy might have some examples of work in the history of the language that might be going wrong if they were just using ECCO-TCP?
Along these lines -- I say things about Charlotte Smith as a female writer who might be marginalized; need a test case of a male writer to compare her against? So, there may be a couple ways to get at what Tom is saying
Charlotte Smith is a useful peg to hang these others things on, but my questions about her are not as interesting as the questions in other chapters.

#2. Discussion about future directions
See two versions of the chapter 1 “dissertation map” below.
Check in re: narrowing focus to just Charlotte Smith: is this appropriate? How should other aspects of the project change in accordance?
Finalize priority list for databases to consider. Currently: ESTC, ECCO, ECCO-TCP, HathiTrust, Project Gutenberg, Google Books (in that order). Also possible: British Library’s 19thC Books corpus, Corvey Collection, Internet Archive, ProQuest Literature Online (Chadwick Healey).
They’re interested in BL
Not interested in ProQuest.
Corvey seems like a special case
Doesn't seem incomplete with current list
Also can have foreground and background -- mention some in passing, go into more detail in other

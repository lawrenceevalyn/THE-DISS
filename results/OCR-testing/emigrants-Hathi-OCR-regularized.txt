T O WILLIAM com/PER, Ess. DEAR SIR, THERE is, I hope, some propriety in my addressing a Com- position to you, which would never perhaps have existed, had I not, amid the beavy pressure of many sorrows, derived infinite consolation from your Poetry, and some degree of animation and of confidence from your ºfteem. The following performance is far from aspiring to be con- sidered as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, “ The “TAsk;” I am perfºy fººl, that it belongs not to a feeble and feminine band to draw the Bow of Ulysses. The force, clearnes, andsublimity of your admirable Poem; the felicity, almost peculiar to your genius, of giving to the most familiar obječís dignity and effečf, I could never hope to 3. - reach

A Dedication usually consists of praises and of apologies ; my praise can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applaus: of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the few, who, at the present period, rescue her from the imputa- tion of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the form of Apology, I should have much to say, if I again dared to plead the pressure of evils, aggravated by their long conti- nuance, as an excuse for the defects ºf this attempt. JWhatever

[ vii I Whatever may be the faults of its execution, let me vindi- cate myself from thºse, that may be imputed to the design.— In speaking of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be understood as feeling the utmost respect for the integrity of their principles; and it is with pleasure I add my suffrage to that of those, who have had a similar opportunity of witnessing the conduć of the Emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in Eng- land; which has been such as does Aonour to their nation, and ought to secure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal mind. 2 our philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, I am per- Juaded, to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may Jinally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred sº unworthy of great and enlightened nations ; that it may tend to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good qualities exist in the other; and at length annihilate the pre- judices that have so song existed to the injury of both. Tet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of the English, this national aversion has acquired new force by the dreadful scenes which have been atted in France during 2 2 the

Perhaps even the Author of “The Tasº,” with all Air good- nes; and tenderness of Áeart, is in the catalogue of thos, who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause, which it was once the glory of Englishmen to avow and defend- The exquisite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her sincerest friends, was published sºme years before the demolition of regal dºspotism in France, which, in the fifth book, it stems fo º s

SLOW in the Wintry Morn, the struggling light Throws a faint gleam upon the troubled waves; Their foaming tops, as they approach the shore And the broad surf that never ceasing breaks On the innumerous pebbles, catch the beams Of the pale Sun, that with reluctance gives To this cold northern Isle, its shorten’d day.

Yet He, whose Spirit into being call’d This wond’rous World of Waters; He who bids The wild wind lift them till they dash the clouds, And speaks to them in thunder; or whose breath, Low murmuring o'er the gently heaving tides, When the fair Moon, in summer night serene, Irradiates with long trembling lines of light Their undulating surface; that great Power, Who t

* NOTES To THE FIRST BOOK. * “ ENDS the chace.”]—I have a confused notion, that this expression, with nearly the same application, is to be found in Young: but I cannot refer to it. * “Regrets his pious prison and his beads.”]—Lest the same attempts at misrepresentation should now be made, as have been made on former occasions, it is necessary to repeat, that nothing is farther from my thoughts, than to refle& invidiously on the Emigrant Clergy, whose steadi- ness of principle excites veneration, as much as their sufferings compassion. Adversity has now taught them the charity and humility they perhaps wanted, when they made it a part of their faith, that salvation could be obtained in no other religion than their own. * “The splendid palaces.”]—Let it not be confidered as an insult to men in fallen fortune, if these luxuries (undoubtedly inconsistent with their profesfion) be here enumerated—France is not the only country, where the splendour and indulgences of the higher, and the poverty and depression of the inferior Clergy, have alike proved injurious to the cause of Religion. * See the finely descriptive Verses written at Montauban in France in 1750, by Dr. Joseph Warton. Printed in Dodsley's Miscellanies, Vol. IV. page 203. 5 “ Who amid the sons “ Of Reason, Valour, Liberty, and Virtue, E 2 “ Displays

Page 36
[ 36 J “ Displays distinguished merit, is a Noble “ Of Nature's own creation.”]– These lines are Thomson's, and are among those sentinents which are now called (when used by living writers), not common-place declamation, but sentiments of dangerous tendency. * “ Exalt not from the crowd.”]—It has been said, and with great ap- pearance of truth, that the contempt in which the Nobility of France held the common people, was remembered, and with all that vindićtive asperity which long endurance of oppression naturally excites, when, by a wonderful concurrence of circumstances, the people acquired the power of retaliation. Yet let me here add, what seems to be in some degree inconfistent with the former charge, that the French are good masters to their servants, and that in their treatment of their Negro slaves, they are allowed to be more mild and merciful than other Europeans. * “But more the Men.”]—The Financiers and Fermiers Generaux are here intended. In the present moment of clamour against all those who have spoken or written in favour of the first Revolution of France, the declaimers seem to have forgotten, that under the reign of a mild and easy tempered Monarch, in the most voluptuous Court in the world, the abuses by which men of this description were enriched, had arisen to such height, that their prodigality exhausted the immense resources of France: and, unable to supply the exigencies of Government, the Ministry were compelled to call Le Tiers Etat; a meeting that gave birth to the Revolu- tion, which has since been so ruinously condućted. * “The breast of Patriot Virtue.”]—This sentiment will probably renew against me the indignation of those, who have an interest in asserting that no such virtue any where exists.

But on this Upland scene, while April comes, With fragrant airs, to fan my throbbing breast, Fain would I snatch an interval from Care, That weighs my wearied spirit down to earth; Courting, once more, the influence of Hope (For “Hope” still waits upon the flowery prime) As here I mark Spring's humid hand unfold The early leaves that fear capricious winds, While, even on shelter'd banks, the timid flowers Give

NOTES To THE SECOND BOOK. mº-mm * “ HOPE waits upon the flowery prime.”]— - “Famine, and Sword, and Fire, crouch for employment.”]— SHAKSPEARE. • “ Monsters both !”]—Such was the cause of quarrel between the Houses of York and Lancaster; and of too many others, with which the page of History reproaches the reason of man. * “Oh polish'd perturbation –golden care!" SHAKSPEARE. * “The brave Bernois.”]—Henry the Fourth of France. It may be said of this monarch, that had all the French sovereigns resembled him, despotism would have lost its horrors; yet he had confiderable failings, and his greatest virtues may be chiefly imputed to his education in the School of Adversity. “ Delug'd, as with an inland sea, the vales.”]—From the heavy and incessant rains during the last campaign, the armies were often compelled to march for many miles through marshes overflowed; suffering the extre- mities of cold and fatigue. The peasants frequently misled them; and, after having passed these inundations at the hazard of their lives, they were sometimes under the necessity of crossing them a second and a third time; their evening quarters after such a day of exertion were often in a wood without shelter; and their repast, instead of bread, unripe corn, without any other preparation than being mashed into a sort of paste. * The

Page 68
I 68 j * “The prey of dark suspicion and regret."]—It is remarkable, that notwithstanding the excessive hardships to which the army of the Emi- grants was exposed, very few in it suffered from disease till they began to retreat; then it was that despondence consigned to the most miserable death many brave men who deserved a better fate , and then despair im- pelled some to suicide, while others fell by mutual wounds, unable to survive disappointment and humiliation. * “Right onward.”]—Milton, Sonnet 22d. * “I gave to misery all I had, my tears.”]—GRAY.

## State as clearly and as specifically as possible the scope and method of the inquiry as well as the relationship of the topic to present scholarship in the field.

The goal of this thesis is to apply computational methods to questions relevant to late 18th / early 19thC literary study.

Ann Radcliffe is assumed to be representative of the Gothic, but in fact she is very different in almost every possible way from the masses of works which are assumed to be copies of her.

What works are taken to be 'representative' of the canon 1780-1810? What, exactly, are they meant to 'represent'? What do they have in common with those works? Are they actually similar?

How can we find 'average', rather than remarkable, works? What conclusions do we draw if we look at those average works?

What if we look at popularity? -- true popularity, which encompasses not just what is published new but what is purchased re-issued.

London popular media, 1790-1810.

The uses of Shakespeare!

Look at authors who use many genres.

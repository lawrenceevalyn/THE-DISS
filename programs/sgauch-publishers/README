in.txt
   Text file with long format names to simplify
   One publisher per line, names separated by ;

wordmap.csv
   CSV file with word substitutions  (may not have spaces)
   One substitution per line, separated by commas
   Use NULL if you want the words deleted
   Try to use this first to remove stuff before adding to namemap
   e.g., 
   Edinburgh,NULL
   jun,Jr.

namemap.csv
   Text file with name substitutions (may have spaces)
   One substitution per line, separated by semicolons
   Use NULL if you want the names deleted
   This is used AFTER the wordmaps are applied, so can clean up any mess left behind
   e.g., 
   W. Church & Sons;W. Church
   T. Brown,;T. Brown 

out.csv
   CSV file with long format names (original) followed by short format
   Each line has one pairing, separated by ,
   Individual publishers are separated by ;

Once the input files are created, run the program with:
./run.sh
Examine the output file: out.csv using vim.

HOW IT WORKS
============
run.sh splits ESTC.txt into small pieces named xaa .. xbi
It then renames each piece to in.txt
It then runs convert, producing one output file per input file, i.e., xaa.csv .. xbi.csv
It concatenates those together to create one large file called out.csv

Modify the mapping files to improve.

The goal of this program is to take in a CSV file of entries in a corpus, and to randomly output 100 of them for future use.

Because I want to be able to replicate my work, and because I think it will be easier to code, the 100 "random" numbers should be generated from random.org and stored in a txt file.

The relevant files are hard-coded because... right now it's easier for me to figure out how to hard-code them than it is to implement having the user provide them in the command line.

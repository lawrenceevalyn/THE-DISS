## State as clearly and as specifically as possible the scope and method of the inquiry as well as the relationship of the topic to present scholarship in the field.

My doctoral research will interrogate the critical assumption that the masses of popular Gothic novels (c. 1760-1840) functioned as cheap copies of critically-renowned originals. While the early Gothic novel is well-known to be characterized by excess—volatile emotions, exotic settings, baroque plots, and sheer quantity of publications—the critical conversation has thus far focused on only a small percentage of the hundreds of novels published under the aegis of the Gothic. The works of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Gregory Lewis, in particular, are taken to be representative, but this focus tends to dismiss developments in the genre, and especially the contours of its popular consumption. If we wish, instead, to examine the Gothic on a scale commensurate with its consumption, we rapidly reach the point at which, as Franco Moretti has often noted, “reading ‘more’ seems hardly to be the solution” (55). My research will complement wide reading with a range of digital tools in order to compare critical opinions with a substantial body of texts beyond the canon. I am especially interested in overturning the association of male and female authorship with, respectively, traditions of horror and terror.

 For questions of gender and of genre, I begin by asking whether a distinction ought to be made before pursuing definitions. Modern critics and contemporary readers alike speak of the birth of Gothic as a male-dominated ‘school of Lewis,’ which horrifies readers by confronting them with grisly sights; by contrast, the female-dominated ‘school of Radcliffe’ drives readers to terrify themselves by imagining gruesome explanations for ominous secrets. The horror mode and the terror mode are discussed as two halves of a gendered binary. My current research at the University of Victoria, however, suggests that, while a male-dominated tradition of horror certainly exists, it is dwarfed by a non-gendered mainstream. During my doctoral degree, I will confirm and expand upon these findings
 
 During my doctoral degree, I will continue this research with the full texts of Tracy’s 208 Gothic novels. The first phase of my doctoral project will consist of building my corpus: many repositories of digitized texts provide access to page images that are well-suited to most scholarly use, but a corpus-based approach also requires machine-readable text files, generally produced from page images by optical character recognition (OCR) software. Unfortunately, OCR is prone to errors: although 162 of the 208 texts under consideration are readily available in digital formats, only 7 have error-free text files. A further 115 have text files of unreliable quality, and 40 have page images only (i.e., no downloadable text files).

The bulk of my analytical project will then be to build on this foundational corpus. I will continue my investigation of gendered trends in the Gothic, now paying attention to stylistics and form only analyzable once the corpus is in place. Applying the technical skills I have gained through UVic’s internationally-respected Digital Humanities Summer Institute, I will ask again whether men and women of the period wrote differently. I will be able to compare Lewis and Radcliffe’s works to a reference corpus of their apparent imitators. While I do not seek to question either Lewis or Radcliffe’s status as literary trailblazers, I do hope to form a more nuanced picture of their influence, and of the traditions in which they wrote, and my corpus of full texts will allow me to pursue a mapping of horror and terror that is currently largely speculative. For instance, it will be possible to test Frederick Frank’s Gothic genre classifications; it will be possible to create network visualizations to elucidate relationships between texts; if I am able to collaborate with a computer scientist during my research, it will be possible to put together a sample of the novels I have read and classified as training texts for topic-modelling approaches to identifying the genres of the remaining works.
* Most Frequent Word network mapping to see clusters of similarity
* I'd like to try an 'evolutionary theory' approach like Moretti's take on detective fiction, to examine the role of the explained supernatural


# annotated bibliography
## 10-15 items that register the methodological / theoretical / critical priorities of the thesis project

1. **Algee-Hewitt, Mark. "Acts of Aesthetics: Publishing as Recursive Agency in the Long Eighteenth Century." *Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net* 57-8 (2010). Web.** "Of primary concern to late eighteenth-century society was the sheer volume of printed work being produced in England. The response of authors troubled by this perceived crisis was an outpouring of works on taste, aesthetics, genre and literature... Yet this response itself, of course, only added to the number of works within Britain. ... This essay outlines a potential solution to this problem by sampling a highly focused selection of digitized texts that raise the issue of over-publication. Through a quantitative analysis of these texts, it identifies the lexical patterns that may reveal the ways in which authors of the period envisioned the work of aesthetics. In particular, this article identifies an emerging consensus on how printed objects became agents within the socio-cultural world of the long eighteenth century: both as objects which could act on readers and as objects which could act on other printed texts."

1. **Worrall, David. *Celebrity, Performance, Reception: British Georgian Theatre as Social Assemblage.* Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2013 Print.** From Amy Garnai's review: The idea of “social assemblage,” originating in the work of philosopher Manuel De Landa, theorizes social structures and networks and the material forces and complexities that underpin them. Worrall adapts De Landa’s insights specifically to theatre with the proposition that “all physical spaces, locations and embodiments of performance are expressive and comprise population components within a connected social network or assemblage of production and reception." ... In its use of a methodological framework that is new to theatre studies, in its privileging of the quantitative methods of analysis associated with this theory, and especially in Worrall’s impressive historical research and thorough engagement with archival sources, Celebrity, Performance, Reception is essential reading for scholars of the Georgian theatre.

# THE-DISS

## Research Goals
* I want to address, somehow, the use of canons, and consider better ways to contextualize and teach literature
* I want to apply the conceptual frameworks of prototyping and models to literary research

## To Do
* Preliminary Thesis Proposal Nov 1
* I need to do a lot more reading in the 18thC

## Research Log

### Nov 30 2016

The English Short Title Catalogue says there are 51996 titles published in England 1789-1799!! That's a lot. Also, it will only give me information on the first 1001 results?

I'd love to compare against the Richardson/Fielding era but I feel like five years is too short to capture the period I'm interested in (surely I should do all of Radcliffe's ouvre?) and ten years is clearly an ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM.

Reading Moretti's *Distant Reading*:
* Look up Literary Lab pamphlet 1, "Quantitative Formalism"
* He promised studies of Austen's rivals, and then never did them: can I do it?
* Can I copy his methods of looking for clues in Doyle's competitors to see Radcliffe's success? Does a similar pattern follow for the explained supernatural?
* I, too, am interested in "*rivals*: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (67)
* This book charts Moretti's working-out of the (conflicting?) theories of evolutionary selection and centre-periphery systems, as explanations for literary history. I also care centrally about these questions! They are my driving questions!
* What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (141)
* "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (145)
* The essay "Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles" is VERY EXCITING to me; and I might be one of the only readers who begins this essay already having read the bibliography in question cover-to-cover!

Reading so many articles. Nothing feels clear or connected. What am I *doing*?

### Oct 21 2016
#### Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeareâ€™s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

### Oct 10 2016
I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

### Oct 8 2016
thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)

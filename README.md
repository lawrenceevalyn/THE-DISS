# Research Goals
* I want to address, somehow, the use of canons, and and consider better ways to contextualize and teach literature
    * Somehow I want to "account for" the arc of literature in all its variety
* I want to apply the conceptual frameworks of prototyping and models to literary research
* I really like the Gothic; I really like everything I learn enough about
* I want to do reparative research: 
    * "The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
    * "What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."

# Current Priorities
* Assemble a **short** document of guiding principles
    * Figure out what question the field of literary study is trying to answer, exactly
    * Figure out what question I, personally, want most urgently to know the answer to
* Finish throwing my research ideas to date into the scrivener doc
* Start setting up a relational database
* Start drafting the first chapter

# Writing workflow
* Literally every idea I have for “research”, of any kind, goes in the monster scrivener doc.
* One snippet per thought. Keep the pieces small.
* Let it all accumulate into groupings organically. Don't try to organize too soon.
* Don't create empty spaces for thoughts to go in the future. (Add research questions and hypotheses instead.)

# Next-do: migrate thoughts from research log to monster scrivener doc
Then color-code ideas

# Research Log

## December 7, 2018

I keep wanting to get more ridiculously exhaustive, just to see if I *can*.

Could I reconstruct a month? Track down, e.g., weather, exactly what was published each day, letters and diaries from as many people as possible — how much information can I get on the happenings of a single day?

## November 30, 2017

Finished OGS application -- time for special fields!!!!

## November 27, 2017

Hypotheses to test in shakespeare project:
- Stiller et al day that plays have an upper limit in size because of an inherent limit in human social groupings; plays become incoherent if they present more people/groups than humans are accustomed to tracking the detailed relationships of. But what if this is a metric distinguishing tragedies and comedies, and tragedies present fracturing social worlds where comedies present clear and connected/clustered worlds?
- in-degree/out-degree disparity as a marker for social rank?

## November 17, 2017

Meeting with Dr Lopez:
- some ideas about using it as a pedagogical tool, especially if we can visually encode unreliability of source texts, have it give more useful "feedback", put charts next to each other at same scale, include substantial editorial apparatus
- but honestly, I don't want to get into the world of pedagogical shakespeare tools. I think our time would be better spent moving on to 18thC texts
- does mom want to try to collaborate with the personas tool people??
- I think we could publish some basic genre things in a CS or *maybe* DH journal, but not a literary one. So, I don't want to spend TOO long on that, and instead go forward with 18thC tragedies

## November 15, 2017

question for mom: are you at all interested in a database unification project..? I’m trying to figure out how to combine multiple archives and it occurs to me that something ProFusion-y might be interesting... the main difficulty comes from the fact that many interesting databases are ‘closed’ and require institutional access; but would it be possible to have someone log in via their institution and search one database that correlates 

## November 14, 2017

Reviewing notes from meeting with Tom & Terry to make a report to Alex; some ideas that seem particularly fruitful right now:
* Gothic as cross-generic mode
* The decade's attention to timeliness requires a particular generic reciprocity and reponsiveness from all works
    * the idea of a work as a singular unified "object" is created by modern editing

## November 11, 2017

####Explaining fields to Olli:

passing the exam means proving that I am ready to write my first chapter

and to write a chapter that I know will actually fit inside of the dissertation as a while, I now need to have about a 50% understanding of what the hell my dissertation is ABOUT

Lawrence: like: are all my chapters going to be “compare two authors and how they use one genre”? (I…. think so???)

Lawrence: are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?

Lawrence: if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format

Lawrence: and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?

Lawrence: or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More & Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”

Lawrence: and that’s the one where I talk about my emerging theory of timeliness

Lawrence: or is timeliness not a chapter, but in fact the overarching theme of the whole diss?

Lawrence: who knows!!! hopefully me, in a month!

## November 8, 2017

Meeting with mom about Shakespeare!

Updates on progress:
- I sent mom some abstracts
-- progressive structuration - similar questions as me about how to look at plot at a large scale, but a 
-- Hewitt's paper - he did basically the same thing we did technically speaking, but then extracted just one mathematical feature (Eigenvector centrality) and saw a long-term historical trend in that figure
--- we can be different by looking at more/different figures, and seeing what correlated with genres; we're interested 
-- Personae - a pretty (but uninteresting too), only two plays, and yet sufficient for presentation at ADH
--- what we're doing better is looking at genre, wider variety of statistics available, more plays, more useful tool

- Word Vectors: mom did this in 1999! we should do something with this, for 2019...?
-- topic models are just dimensionality and math, nothing remotely semantic to them; word vectors get more semantically involved because they pay attention to word contexts
--- runs on individual words; for every individual word see what words occur around it, coming up with a vector, 
---- what is the usage of "Gothic"? ***
-- began as a technique to automatically build thesaurae (which could then be used to expand querys for search!) -- but published it as a query expansion technique, not as a text analysis technique


Project status:
- quotations: going more slowly; mom met with her and she should be done with GREs this week and resuming research again
- networks: almost had all the data etc today! but it will be Friday
- comparing plays to movie scripts, waiting on Manisha

Potential future development: if networks are indeed useful for genre, train a neural network on them and see if it can identify genre
- compare English, French, and Asian plays from different time periods

## November 1, 2017

Reading Rita Felski -- I am energized by a desire to recuperate the emotional *use* to which the Gothic can be put as an outlet and coping mechanism for suffering, for social subjection, for lack of futurity

## October 31, 2017

Met with Tom today -- Fields has to do with demonstrating capability for teaching undergrads, familiarity with field without getting bogged down in criticism

#### Notes from my journal:

I think these are the general areas in which I hope to write. what sort of questions interest you in these general areas?
1. generic mixing
2. publication history (timeliness) <- narrators, France
3. “information / truth management” <- supernatural (empiricist epistemology)
4. benevolence, sentiment
5. historic memory / futurity? <- discontinuity (apocalypse)
6. commerce & credit

position in relation to scholarship w/o losing text <-- position paper

show broader context for diss *texts* + can situate them among landmarks
* --> engagement w/ *primary* texts + show reading / teaching (keep secondary secondary)

1. less into drama, less in the Romantic curriculum.
    * Gothic as cross-generic mode: interesting, not well-written
2. Beckford - Gothic novels influencing each other out of publication sequence <-- Northanger has
    * Byron poetical Tristram Shandy
3. J Paul Hunter *Before Novels* "continuation _____s" Shandy etc endings
4. novel vs lyric poem vulnerability to parody
    * Hannah More "sensibility" * [for engagement with the danger that sentimental engagement prevents rather than enables direct intervention for good]
        * <-- conservative evangelical attacks on sensibility as well as radicals
        * (More wants to abolition grounded in Christian duty, not "mere" feeling)
5. psychological authors' relation to watershed moments / historic breaks
6. Hume: "On Commerce" / "On Luxury" * "commerce, luxury, money, + interest"

how many Qs help w/ drama?

## October 26, 2017

Talked with Terry today -- *timeliness* is emerging as a crucial concept for me.

#### Notes from my journal:

Things that interest me:
* Ghost stories (Wordsworth vs More, as per Gamer)
* Benevolence
* Economics
* Surprisingly, not works of direct political philosophy? (They're so... theatrica? I find their emotional narratives more palatable in fiction) -- Frustrated by disconnect between content and rhetoric
* Timeliness as a literary trait -- many seemingly unified works are actually not (Shandy, CSmith, WW + LB)

W's preface why poetry vs *theatre*

Jeff Cox edition of Keats - chronological
--> I should look for scholarship *

Shandy + Otranto * Timeliness --> DH meetings,

When do people write about Marie Antoinette in prison? does she get mentally imprisoned before reality? <-- a lot on Marie, need to find something *really surprising* to be worth it

generic reciprocity

what occurs *between* volumes / editions that makes one work need to be responsive?

**The decade's attention to timeliness requires a particular generic reciprocity** * *
* (More interesting than tracing literal direct discussion of French Revolution)

Dany O'Quinn - performance negotiating aftermath of American War

my frustration with treatises -> a result of time pressure ---- pressure produces affective quality?
* --> but Godwin *does* pause to reflect etc and then I get bored and want a novel

pamphlet vs tome *physically* ephemeral/timely

Mary Robinson's "snowdrop" poem from novel <-- like CSmith + Radcliffe

( -->)mediation + remediation (<-- like citation)
* --> Terry will find scholars

editions are "theme + variatins" not unified, singular

## October 25, 2017

Notes from meeting with mom:

meeting with mom

- I will go through the DH2018 application beforehand

AGENDA ITEMS
- ask mom what has been done so far

-- Manisha Shulka (MA student) is in charge of the projects, she is doing her masters thesis in this area

-- the French students have gone; they were working on two distinct projects:
--- we have downloaded and parsed all of the Shakespeare, and built social networks on all of them (Pierre and Manuel, and before than Preston)
--- Manisha is in charge of putting that on the web
--- get these exposed and really happy, fix interface issues, etc, and THEN maybe the 500 Early Modern Plays
--- something went wrong with the play... it’s showing definitely wrong numbers for Much Ado but works for Hamlet

-- another student (senior undergrad honors) wants to compare play and movie scripts and how their social networks compare; he is looking at non-shakespeare based just on what he can find scripts of for free (I am interested in all movie adaptations of Hamlet) - but this will be a while

-- freshman honors student is also interested in something here, TB

-- also the quotation project with Marion, looking for all the shakespeare in Northanger Abbey; mom needs to meet with her, is following up now
--- she is having difficulty developing for non-exact matches, ngram matches
--- she has all the ECCO texts parsed; she extracted just the raw text so we can look for any quote in any book

-- Marion is going to combine the best parts of everybody’s parsing code and put it up on the server
-- also going to find all those “details” of numbers paper


- if I want to mess with this:
-- log in as mom with the info given previously, find probably /projects/clip/sna and then the online thing is in javascript package d3; the counting code was in java, then went into gephi to analyse the graph
-- I could copy all of it, play away and make it look nicer, and then merge it back in later

- literary implications: 
-- looking at tragedy, comedy, history
-- do ensembles change over time? interest in large groups or just one protagonist?
-- what plays are most similar, what plays most different?
-- can we detect subplots via clusters? - what’s the mathematical value of cliquishness? gephi has this

- ask what I should say in meeting with Jeremy
-- infodump that we’re working on, demo Hamlet (but don’t leave him with the URL) -- ask him for his immediate thoughts, thumbs-up/down on current lines of thought, what questions dome to mind that you’d like answer to -- and we’ll scurry away
--- who else should we compare to?

** I will send mom that DH2018 paper on social networks

- schedule next meeting

Next steps:
- once the code is working, mom will send Manisha to let me play with aesthetics in a sandbox; once it looks nicer, we’ll move it into the main area
- I will get the CLiP website sorted in the mean time
- I will have an initial meeting with Jeremy
- I will send DH2017 article about networks
- DH2018: the tool (live demo) is available for you to use! email us interesting question you have! we are excited to collaborate with you on new features!
-- plan for us to both go, but negotiate with Emma

** figure christmas plans

## October 24, 2017

The idea of an author doesn't hold water: not just Dorothy Wordsworth is part of William Wordsworth's poems, but also Jane Austen's family is part of her novels; it's inaccurate to imagine them as self-contained founts of genius, all writing is collaboration with someone

The conclusion I draw from that is 20% "so let's make sure we research things like the family joke in Northanger about the name Richard"

And 80%: All *reading* is a collaboration! So when you read something, especially when you're a wee student and you're handed some monument of Literature to read, that's not actually a one-way full of Great Knowledge from the Great Author to you, that's a process that you have a share in, and you probably want to put some work in to make yourself a *good* reader (see: my struggles with sci fi and noir), but you also have the power to choose a mode of reading that works for you, that gives you things you want out of the literature (reparative reading!)

## October 20, 2017

CSECS is SO INSPIRING -- I want to really deeply dig into some research!! I want to know new things that other people might want to hear about!!! I've avoide conferences because writing papers about completed works wasn't helping me get closer to publication -- but now I think I need to do another round of them to inspire me to generate to ideas and research new work. I haven't DONE RESEARCH in ages, and I miss it!

## October 16, 2017

Talked with Alex about some of the research rabbit holes I've been going down--
* glow-worms: a rabbit hole, albeit interesting one
* something about Austen and the negative impact of literary celebrity on legacy: check: go down that rabbit hole
* lessons from the French revolution: does not sound like a rabbit hole so much as  - you learning the broader stuff for your field
* timeline of the French revolution keyed to temperature: also not a rabbit hole, but a cool sideline instead! but after some articles are to readers
* Wordsworth and More: certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business


Notes for meeting with Gillespie:

items accomplished from last time:
- scheduled fields exam!
- finished a readable draft of MA essay journal article and sent it for feedback

items still in progress from last time:
- OGS: reviewed requirements, currently drafting Plan of Study
- meetings with Tom & Terry re: fields questions: I will reach out schedule these today
- MLA paper: next step was to pick a gamey journal to publish in, I have a shortlist and am narrowing it down
- think about research questions for my diss that *I* really want to know the answers to:
-- I am going down a lot of little, odd rabbit holes! (like glowworms)
-- I am thinking about Jane Austen, and wondering whether my chronological focus is cutting me off from something interesting... why Austen and not Radcliffe? What would the literary canon look like with Radcliffe as our central figure? (I re-read Udolpho and it’s GOOD)

items Alex was going to do:
- look into ways for me to be involved with DHN
- sound out Holger re: Shakespeare collaboration

things to talk about today:
- MA essay journal article?
- diss research questions?

## October 1, 2017

Stray notes found while tidying my desktop:

#### Gothic notes.txt

gothic as survival strategy for vulnerable women

the gothic of A Little Princess

the meaning of suffering


if I want to topic model Gothic and Not Gothic, my Not Gothic needs to be some astonishingly boring non-fiction treatise in order to ensure that it is actually not gothic

## September 30, 2017

Lesson learned from editing my journal article: I'd gotten carried away starting a new paper entirely at the end; when I felt like I needed "more" in order to conclude, even though I'd hit the word count, that was the next idea getting started. **Be on the look-out for a new paper starting, as the sign that the previous paper has finally finished.** (Just like starting to revise/write my second draft means that the first draft has previously finished!)

## September 20, 2017

One of the lessons we should probably learn from the French Revolution is that ideological purity is not only unecesseary, it is impossible.

## September 19, 2017

Okay, but really, what **if** the Norton Anthology presented all the works in chronological order, instead of grouping them by author? You could include author bios at at author's first appearance, but the whole system of biographical readings would break down.. instead, there would have to be running historical contextualization. It would make current ways of teaching inconvenient, but perhaps in productive ways: if you wanted to read a bunch of poems by one author, students would have to skip past the other writing that was produced in between, a tangible reminder of the time that actually did separate those works. It also makes it easier to sub in less "important" authors, when you're looking for a work to fill just one chronological slice rather, than an author whose ouevre will be broadly applicable.

---

I want to do something like **Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha: Negotiating the Boundaries of the Dramatic Canon**, by Peter Kirwan ... does that mean I am going to have to much about with Wordsworth and Coleridge and the Romantics? (At that point am I just replicating Michael Gamer's work?)

Part of what frustrates me is that these important, fascinating novels **aren't** in any kind of canon, that the canon just skips from Richardson to Austen, despite the fact that Austen is a wild aberration.

Oh no... am I going to have to write against **Austen**?? But I adore her!

(also, how hilariously nearsighted that I can't think of anybody canonical from my period, hahaha, when Austen is one of the few names able to tangle with Shakespeare.)

## September 9, 2017

I think it is the reparative impulse that is making my special fields reading so poweful -- I just read Shelley's Ode to the West Wind, and it was beautiful, in a way it never had been before, just as Wordsworth and Coleridge have been beautiful, and even Blake was bearable for the very first time. All my previous attempts have been from the position of needing to dissect and master these giants whose importance would determine my own; my hurried and impersonal readings couldn't find the value in them. But now that I read them looking for pleasure and for interest, and looking also for how the poets themselves were engaged with their worlds and looking for their own pleasure and interest -- now the rotten wet leaves of autumn are powerful to me, and I too want to hope, that oh, if winter comes, spring must follow.

## September 8, 2017

A bunch of thoughts from tumblr: 

I have been reading for special fields and just... just falling in love
right now I am catching up on the responses to fizzygin's post on fandom and it's connecting to the Eve Sedgwick I've been reading

hbbo
ooooh hooray!!

me
I've been stumbling around for a while in the idea of "reparative reading" as an alternative to the typical reading-symptoms-to-expose-the-hidden-patriarchal-(or-whatever)-systems-lurking-underneath "paranoid reading" of literary texts

hbbo
intriguing, say more

me
this framework is something Sedgwick articulated such that it suddenly crystallized all my thoughts
let me see if I can express it!

me
I suspect it mostly feels like a powerful distinction to someone who has slogged through a hundred mediocre attempts to recreate Foucault, Lacan, Freud, etc, by saying "Pride and Prejudice APPEARS to be a charming love story, but I, the CRITIC, have SEEN ITS SECRETS, and I expose to you now the horrible systems upon which its world rests!"
which falls flat for me partly because, sure, yeah, I am aware of capitalism, it does not surprise me that there is capitalism in P&P. Austen was also aware of capitalism.

hbbo
ha, yes

me
Some of these are more successful than others -- some texts really are relying upon but not willing to examine some lurking system or another
decolonial readings are often more successful for me on that front, because the authors (especially in the 19thC) really are trying to avoid addressing their own complicity

hbbo
right
achebe on heart of darkness, etc.

me
and Sedgwick.. hm, she certainly doesn't argue that one must never interrogate or dissect a text
but she writes out of a frustrated boredom with this approach, and the feeling that, despite the rhetorical flourishes and triumph of the conquering critic, we often don't learn anything new or useful from this process
especially if we're all accustomed now to just assume that *everything* has terrible underlying frameworks

hbbo
/me nods

me
so there are two quotes I have pasted at the top of my dissertation notes doc:

me
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."

hbbo
hmmmm yes, interesting

me
Which is -- a totally different way of responding to the flaws and insufficiencies of a text, and one that has intense appeal to me

hbbo
reminds me of several chapters of that lesbian history by emma donoghue I was reading a month or so ago

me
oh! tell me more!

hbbo
she talks a lot about how, like

hbbo
the fact that a text that represents or misrepresents woman-woman desire, in a lot of ways, fundamentally hostile to that desire or AT THE VERY LEAST extremely ill-informed about it, doesn't mean that historical same-sex-attracted women didn't gain value from those texts, even if that value required different kinds of readings than intended

me
ohhh, yeah!
yeah, that's a perfect example, I think

me
I've just added a bunch of donoghue to y t-read list; that one was Passions Between Women, yeah?

hbbo
reading that book was pretty much a continual exercise in punching the air for me, ahahaha
yes, that's the one

me
that example appeals to me also because it gestures toward a reason for all of this discussion of non-paranoid reading to be called "queer theory", which initially seemed strange to me

hbbo
yes!

me
surely everyone can see that this is an often necessary reading practice, and an important part of literature's role in our lives
the wilful remaking of a text into something that works for you

hbbo
that is definitely the political context in which I've thought most about that general idea
yes

me
my own work is interested in the uses that 18thC basically-heterosexual women make of semi-misogynist literature

hbbo
/me nods!

me
(by basically heterosexual, I mean women who want to end up in happy companionate marriages with men)

hbbo
right

me
I think I've talked to you about this also? the escapist fantasy, in a novel where women are powerless to do anything but cry when kidnapped, is that the crying will work

hbbo
oh, huh--I don't think we have had this conversation, but that makes a lot of sense

me
I've been thinking, also, about the virtues of the Gothic as a narrative mode which doesn't truck with any bullshit about women's place in the world. Powerful men are tyrants who can destroy you! Your feelings are correct on that front! You are excruciatingly vulnerable!
And now here is a story where everything turns out okay anyway.

hbbo
yes. a space in which to really lug out all those repressed anxieties and blow them up as big as they're able to go
can be very cathartic for sure
and not only cathartic but useful

me
yeah, yeah
The contemporary narrative of an "empowering" story for women is about women having power, and indeed a lot of criticism looks at these works to try to find the particular womanly kinds or spheres of power that make the texts "subversive" or "progressive"... and I do see some of that, there is a compelling thread of women having access to emotional manipulation of men as an effective strategy that makes men look foolish and less powerful

hbbo
/me nods

me
but I think for the most part they're not trying to say, "you have the incredible power of emotional manipulation!" -- I really think they're wallowing in the abjectness of acknowledging powerlessness
and, this is the part that has been firing up my soul, the thing you can do, when you have no power, is you can refuse to endorse your oppressor's actions

hbbo
/me nods

me
this is a bit of a fantasy too, really, but it's one that speaks to me -- the idea that as long as you make them FORCE you, as long as you don't capitulate, that's -- it's not POWER, but.....
*hands in the air* this is where I don't know what I'm saying yet

hbbo
no, yeah, it's at the very least a sort of
sovereignty over the self

me
ooooooh, yeah
sovereignty is a good term for it

me
hmm, I'm thinking now that there's also a sort of exposure of tyranny, too. If you refuse to walk with your kidnapper and force him to carry you, you deprive him of some of his illusions

hbbo
right
I feel like this comes up a lot in like
idk, narratives of long captivity, I'm trying to think of examples

me
oh, yeah, there would be a connection there

hbbo
like in 1984, he talks a lot under torture but it's not until he voluntarily betrays his lover that his selfhood is really broken

me
ohhhh, yeah
man, I read that novel like a decade too young to get anything out of it, I should revisit it

hbbo
I mean, DEBATABLE how voluntary that really is if your alternative is getting your face eaten off by rats, but
still

me
well, the 18thC heroine ideal is to literally die before, say, signing paperwork allowing someone to take her ancestral property

hbbo
yeah I read it ages ago as well
ahahahahaha yes

me
but that feels like part of the fantasy, this idea that you actually will just get your face eaten off by rats before you betray your own self
even if in all other interactions you are timid and delicate
1984 of course not being interested in fantasy

hbbo
I think there's certainly a fantasy at play in basically all fictional depictions of torture, face-rats or no, that if a person is really truly morally strong and really believes in themselves & their cause, they will stand up to whatever gets thrown at them

me
that rings true

me
hah, now honestly A Little Princess is coming to mind
but all those victorian ideals of noble suffering
before you said that, I was thinking of A Handmaid's Tale

hbbo
in a way it's a sort of---ahahahaha I never really thought about this parallel, but it's a sort of cultural fantasy of platonic maleness in the same way that 18th century novels gave us a platonic ideal of the sensible (in the sense of exquisitely sensitive) female

me
expand on that!
the platonic ideal of maleness is that pure resistance to torture? 1984 is about this platonic ideal?

hbbo
a real man should stand up to waterboarding or he loses his Real Maleness, in the same way that an 18th century girl should turn instinctively away from indelicate subject matter, even if she has been sheltered from knowing what that indelicacy consists in
well 1984 is... a relevant but maybe not spot-on example

me
oh, that IS interesting, especially since the 18thC value of Real Maleness, I think, actually consists more in never allowing an insult to stand, always responding to defend oneself! And the endurance of suffering is a female cirtue
That level of toughness in the face of torture is certainly a more male ideal nowadays though

hbbo
yeah I'm thinking of, ugh
I feel like there was a debate on this subject around the show "24," though I never watched it

hbbo
where torture was being depicted as this valid tool for extracting useful information from tough men who just needed to be worn down before they would decide to crack
the counter-argument from people who have actually observed how torture works being: when pain gets to a certain point basically everyone will start making up stories they think their torturer wants to hear, in order to make it stop

me
ohhh, interesting
yeah, I recall that conversation

hbbo
so it's both a shitty construction of manhood, and a shitty interrogation technique

me
the broad cultural one, I mean

hbbo
yes

me
ahahaha, I mean: men.

hbbo
LOL ikr

me
if my studies have taught me anything, they've taught me that men have been EXHAUSTING for at least 250 years. in the 18thC it was a woman's responsibility to emotionally manipulate men out of duelling over her; if they duelled and someone died, it was her fault

me
poor Clarissa gets the silent treatment from her whole family because her brother and a guy she hates who tried to assault her got into a duel, and both of them even lived but it was very awkward that now Mr. Assault had to be struck from all their guest lists, and why didn't Clarissa manage the whole thing better??

hbbo
wow
good grief

me
so that's the 1740s, written by a man -- by the 1790s I can see the appeal of novels by women saying "MEN ARE EXHAUSTING AND ACTIVELY TRYING TO FUCK UP YOUR LIFE"

hbbo
ahahahahahaha yes
IT'S TRUE, GIRLS
IT'S ALL TRUE
no rumor too wild

me
that novel is also the progenitor of the woman-grabbed-into-carriage-for-forced-elopement trope, as far as I can tell
uh, are you worried about spoilers for Clarissa?

hbbo
ahahahahaha no
I am not

me
well, he says he will kill himself if she doesn't talk to him in the garden, so she goes to the garden to talk to him
he yanks her into a carriage to drive away to scotland where they can elope
I haven't read this far myself, but evidently along the way he rapes her, and she eventually dies
and then for my fields list every novel by a woman has had a scene where a woman gets grabbed into a carriage against her will for an elopement
I actually asked one of my fellow 18thC scholars if this was a common trope or if I was imagining it, and she laughed and agreed that it's everywhere
but in all the ones I read, what the women do, in the carriage, is they cry, energetically, refusing food or water or sleep

me
for days
until they are on the brink of death

me
and then their attempted kidnapper has to call a doctor, and the doctor says, "you are going to kill this woman if you force her to marry you, do you love her or not??" and the man has to call off the elopement, and the doctor takes the woman home to his wife, and the doctor's wife chaperones her all the way home to her family (i.e., the man who currently owns her) and vouches for her virtue, and her reputation is preserved

and it's just a FASCINATING response to Clarissa?? because it's not a fantasy of being less vulnerable than Clarissa, right, it's not about having some power she didn't have: it's about... the world just rewarding you for your suffering and endurance?

"I become intimate with it by manipulating it, using it, getting messy and tangled and confused with it": kinky! and delicious. Also sorry for vanishing earlier; it was almost time for me to take off & this dude called me with six complaints, & then I drove home & watched "Rope" with Gins. But yes, I definitely see where you're going here! It's a mode of changing the world surrounding the heroine, rather than changing the heroine to suit the world

Conviction in the face of oppression is powerful, if you refuse to believe the tyrants they can never truly conquer you ----- but also preposessions make rationality impossible and hurt society

I think my question is, how did people use this literature to cope? And how can I use this literature to cope?

DH as fully integrated into argument rather than series of experiments, reparative reading, affect, the body, these aren't questions, there are positions I want to occupy in relation to my subject, and my subject is the 1790s -- which means I find myself asking, "what is lovable in Hannah More?" A useful typo, "what is livable in Hannah More?" -- what can she give us if we come to her not looking for contradictions in her theology or desperate to find progressive "resistance" in her avowed conservativism? If we read with the grain instead of against it, we can chuckle at and move past her patronizing attitude to the poor and contemplate the high standards of sincere virtue and self evaluation she promotes

What's reparative about computational methods: You make/remake the object of your inquiry according to your own interests, priorities, lens, whims — you nurture it, claim it, become intimate with it by manipulating it (deformance), using it, getting messy and tangled and confused with it.

The decade 1789-99 is suddenly *about me*, and *mine*.

We want things to be a few, simple, balanced categories — we especially want there to be two equally-matched sides of a binary — but in fact just about everything follows a power-law distribution, which will necessitate a long-tail “misc” category.

### jottings from DHN

*** ask Adam how I can make something come of this shakespeare project with mom

To do this work well, you need to combine archives. But how can you combine archives well and ethically?
Stanford Literary Lab won't share or tell you about their corpus
-- is my dissertation in part about building a database that can bring together disparate sources...?
-- can I get my collaborators to help me with this? can I do it myself??
--- need to have space for multiple "versions" of each text, that can variously combine or separate them (do I have to build this ontology?)
--- want to be able to attach qualitative assesments, join sheets etc... I think I need a relational database

## August 24, 2017

I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history": 

"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."

"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."

It requires research and study, in order to identify and disentangle the many projects and effects within a work; we must know which parts to discard and which to nurture, to render something useful to ourselves, and we must know what exists for us to repurpose: this is why I study literature. And it requires instruction in order to allow students to get past, e.g., "I thought I was supposed to respect Mrs Bennet" to the literary riches within: this is why I teach literature.

(Literature, unlike history, is permitted artistic license.)

This constant re-translation allows us to continue conferring and experiencing value to the work of previous generations. I don't value the past or tradition simplistically, or for the virtue of merely being older; but we do not always have to reinvent the wheel, and seeing that things **were different** in the past can allow us to remember that they will be different in the future.

(Though I suppose, since I proceed on the assumption that it is not possible to perceive or understand the "now," I do often dismiss the contemporary as insufficiently informative to be getting on with.)

Did I give up too soon on acquiring specialized resources? Should I contact Gale/ECCO to try to get more full texts? Should I contact Garside et al to try to get their underlying spreadsheets?

I feel like if I had a more concrete/specific research question I'd have more luck.. or maybe only asking for a particular decade would be limited enough that they'd be willing to cooperate?

How do I find a more specific research question? Why do I, over time, feel less and less clear about what I am trying to find out???

### Rearranging diss scrivener doc:

New guiding principles: Literally every idea I have for “research”, of any kind, goes in this document. One snippet per “thought.” Let it all accumulate into groupings organically.

#### Current status of Shakespeare project:

SO much "ugh" zone built up around this, but I think we're less 'scooped' than I feared...

**Quotation:** I should send mom some specs for what I'd like the data output to look like, based on the great poster I saw at DH2017. But I should also see whether I can research these questions directly using  github.com/lit-mod-vis/middlemarch-critical-histories and http://commonplacecultures.org/

**Networks:** I should ask mom to do all of Shakey's plays and send me the CSV files so I can make graphical networks.
--> ask to implement two different treatments of "asides" and monologues (where audience is and is not node)
I should also start building a corpus of 18thC TEI plays... I might be in better shape than I feared initially.

### DH2017 reflections:

I feel a little frustrated/impatient to see other people farther along with research questions that I am interested in, but am trying to take this as evidence that I am on a good track and they will be interested in my results.

Things I'm doing differently:
* **Quotations**: treat Shakespeare as 18thC canonical author rather than Early Modern; look for use of extract books
* (*Networks**: examining role of the audience in the node; specifically looking at 18thC transitional tragedy (can I spot "firsts"?)
* **1790s popular literature**: encompassing multiple generic forms, esp pamphlets etc; checking the selection biases of ECCO (and HathiTrust?); combining many datasets

Everybody seems to be using HathiTrust these days, but I just don't like their messy data... :/ But, I *am* trying to combine as many datasets as possible, so HathiTrust probably has a role to play?

Had a good chat with Alyssa about what I'm learning about the French revolution... Some thoughts:

> L: the difference between a bunch of drunken idealists vs a bunch of over-caffeinated idealists.... is madame guillotine

> A: they go to declare war, vibrating, sweating a little, eyes darting everywhere
>
> A: “are... are you okay” asks the holy roman empire
>
> A: “IT’S THE REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR” they say, their hair sticking up from all the sweat

> L: it was the summer, they were hot, the haitian revolution had deprived them of all their coffee and sugar, the revolutionaries had nothing left to live for
>
> A: Oh, caffeine withdrawal, that explains it
>
> L: everyone was hangry

> A: Have you considered writing your dissertation on the impact of coffee on the french revolution
>
> L: honestly... I.... could? I am really interested in the impact of bodily experience throughout all this nonsense. it REALLY DOES make more sense when you remember that everyone is hot, and caffeinated, and hangry
>
> L: and, like, that’s the crucial flaw in all their enlightenment philosophy, right
>
> L: they’re rejecting bodily experience as irrelevant
>
> A: Everybody still has a body and that body needs stuff no matter how loudly they say it doesn’t
>
> L: right, yeah, and everyone still has emotions too
>
> L: and if you ignore your body and your feelings, you mis-diagnose yourself -- you are even less rational than your default
>
> L: you hear about an army deserting, and you feel a lot of things, and you decide “RATIONALLY my feelings must mean TRAITORS ARE EVERYWHERE AND WE MUST MURDER THEM”
>
> L: or even, like: you murder a bunch of random people, and you feel bad, and you say to yourself “rationally I DON’T feel bad because I am a PATRIOT” and then you murder MORE people when... maybe... those feelings contained important info? vis-a-vis murder?

David's pre- and post-revolutionary paintings get at this problem very well! His dismissal of, and then embrace of, womanly sentiment.

Everybody is still **using** emotions to make arguments, they're just all trying to pretend otherwise.



## August 1, 2017

**IS** there a reason to pre-emptively focus on sustained prose fiction, when evaluating the literary output of a period?? Or to focus on poetry?? WHY are all the bibliographies of novels???

## July 24, 2017

Conspiracy theories play such a huge role in France! The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!

Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

## July 22, 2017

How does all my special fields reading relate to my dissertation?? Is it just that I care about Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson now? I don't think I'm necessarily reading the expressive "variety" that I argue characterizes literary production and needs to be coped with.... things are pretty similar. Does knowing more about the French Revolution help me somehow? I do feel like I HAVE A better "feel" for the period, from having read so much more.... I am especially noticing as a major theme the desperate distress over the operation of "preposession" that I wrote about as an undergrgrad -- I think I was onto something there! Should I foreground "preposession" further, and its relationship to the political philosophy of the day? It definitely seems connected to tyranny -- Even in More's history of Mary Woods, evidence and testimony are utterly useless and the vulnerable have no recourse when subjected to tyranny based in prepossession. This seems like a fruitful philosophical thread!

## July 15, 2017

Reading Claudia Johnson's article "'Let Me Make the Novels of a Country': Barbauld's 'The British Novelists'" was an astonishing and inspiring breath of incredibly incisive research, so closely tied to everything I am interested in re: re-examining the canon, and women in the canon, not from the naive position of replacing the canon with a women now, but from a complex and historically-grounded perspective. Her incisive readings of the agendas of, e.g, Watt and Kiely, too, were just excellent. I want to do that! How do I do that?

Workflow thoughts: do I need, like, a big cork board to physically tack ideas to? To go all What Is The Connection? ... I want to be properly grappling with the difficult-but-rewarding critical work (like the Johnson article) more often, and to *produce* things that I can then use, as a result -- I want to build my thoughts into something... how can I do that other than by spending a month in the woods as a hermit?

## July 7, 2017

WHAT IF I USED TOPIC MODELLING TO LOOK AT FRANK'S GOTHIC TYPES? Maybe there is too little text? But finding words that "mean" the same thing as each other seems like.. what topic modelling is for?

## July 4, 2017

My thinking workflow, I think, involves gathering a bunch of bits in a voracious acquisition mode, and then synthesizing everything in a short burst later. So, I will gather paragraph-sized ideas in writing and in visualizations (rough ones) in scrivener, where I can rearrange them and group them thematically, and then when it's time to make a chapter I'll hide in the woods with indesign for a month to pull it together. 

## July 1, 2017

What is my WORKFLOW? Am I dumping thoughts into Scrivener? Into InDesign?? Into a website? Should I have an outline? A bunch of scraps? I can't figure out how to think all at once about all of the bits and pieces I have flying around!!

## June 16, 2017

Final observations/results from topic modelling titles:

Opening Q: What topics are represented in our scholarly, edited corpora of eighteenth century texts? How do those compare to mass print production in the period?

Method: 50 topic models of titles of ESTC works vs ECCO-TCP, both from 1789-99

Results: As perhaps might have been anticipated, the
ECCO corpus emphasizes “timeless” literary and philosophical works, whereas the ESTC corpus is dominated by “timely” advertisements, government bulletins, and ephemera.

![topic modeling results](THE-DISS/figures/R-topic-models/estc-ecco-topic-comparison-notes.png)

## June 15, 2017

I could (and perhaps should?) write one R program which will go through both my corpora, save wordclouds and topics etc in the desirable locations

## June 14, 2017

Topic modelling works much better on titles than it had any right to, really!

(make sure to describe contents of figure folders, how they were generated, etc)

## June 13, 2017

OMG OMG OMG, topic-model titles of ESTC and then use those topics on the ECCO-TCP documents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## June 6, 2017

Tufte class was great for doing lots of thinking!!

Thoughts about design:
* keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your **content**
* very successful data presentation in news story just... says numbers, when they are needed. not encoded into charts, corralled into special number boxes -- just stated directly.
* a key is a sign you designed something wrong: label things are directly as possible, especially for colour coding
* information at exact point of need
* your comparison should be: put your design in one window, and google maps into a window next to it. once you're done weeping, ask, "why can't I do this?"
* *total indifference to mode of production* is critical. (oh god, I'm going to lay out my whole diss in indesign, aren't I)
* sparkline graphics integrate image and word, have incredible resolution
* use Gill Sans (or maybe Trebuchet) for graphics -- great density

Six principles of design:
1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences
2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemtic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't *do* anything with the information without causality)
3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate
4. *completely integrate* words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc
5. documentation must thorouhgly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales
6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.

Thoughts about my research / dissertation:
* "in studying human behaviour, most 'big data' us repurposed data -- that's not how science works" -- don't repurpose data, collect it, with a focus and for a purpose
* **can** I identify / manipulate cause and effect?
    * I guess my MA question is "does gender cause different kinds of writing"?
* I'm trying to look at **books** -- can I get all the book dots moving around? to show more of my data, more granularly?
    * HOW do I design them?? by hand, in indesign and illustrator???
* My dissertation is to tackled 1789-99. It doesn't matter where my information is FROM, don't do a chapter on ESTC and a chapter on ECCO-TCP, etc!! *See what's there*, and **connect** them in an enormous, rich, multivariate visualization
    * (I will have such a fight with the department over this...)
    * I want to do what Minard did. It would be much harder than writing a lot of words, and much more useful.
* Research Q: *what is the impact of the French Revolution in British literature?* (**lots** of detail to dig into here)
* Research Q: Who is reading what in Britain?
* Tufte **also** thinks 3D is the future... I want to pull the Corvey PDFs into a Unity environment, implement the book properly! I could probably do this myself in a year or two.... **or** I could print out all the books, which would be less share-able but much better for me.
* I need a better data organization process. Maybe, a central location for each little bit, with clear descriptions of what's in there and how it got there? and then a big pile of individual bits of ideas for drafting the diss in... charts-to-self and conclusions-to-self also.
* Research project: systematic meta-analysis of The Literature (and especially what it says about various forms of literary production), in spreadsheet form of coursse

## June 5, 2017

I will be able to do topic modelling on my ECCO-TCP corpus at DHSI!!

"Topics" I'd like to try to find:
- poetry/prose/drama
- Gothic / non-Gothic
- men / women

All of those would be "use some training texts -- see if they're accurate on the main corpus" uses of topic modelling; I should try to find my training texts in advance...

## May 26, 2017

As I read McLeod's dissertation, I am almost overwhelmed by how much work she did and how much she is investigating exactly the kinds of things that interest me -- I keep meaning to look quickly through it for the key points, but I get sucked in.

## May 22, 2017

I have a LOT of ideas about my research questions from talking with Jakob this weekend, and don't want to formally, though I hesitate to "publish" them even this much! I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???


## May 15, 2017

Can I use some of the stuff I'm doing for Shakespeare for this dissertation?? Maybe the theatrical social network modelling? (How can I tell when two research ideas are part of the same.. idea?)

## May 11, 2017

IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability

Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?

## May 8, 2017

Is the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here? Am I interested in the novel as a form at all? Why is everyone else so interested in the novel to the exclusion of other literary forms???

Am I interested in the poetry, actually? How can I see which generic form dominates the decade?

## April 29, 2017

Picking up my MA research again has really re-energized my desire to work with a range of bibliographies for the decade -- it's a short enough period that I don't actually have to rely on the ESTC, and really I don't want the ESTC to take on too much authority/prominence

Already have: ESTC, Ann Tracy, Frederick Frank. Should add: Garside bib of the novel, Franz Potter's bib of bluebooks. Should find: something for plays! something for poetry! something for pamphlets??!

## April 22, 2017

Info on publishers, answering my earlier questions, from Garside!

"By the 1790s it was not unusual for authors to change publishers, in seeking out advantages, Charlotte Smith switching between Cadell, Robinson, John Bell, and Sampson Low; Ann Radcliffe moving from Thomas Hookham (at the higher end of the circulating library trade) to publish The Mysteries of Udolpho with Robinson and The Italian (1797) with Cadell, the former advertised as comprising ‘four very large volumes’ and both set a premium price. Almost invariably it was such authors who managed to claim larger payments and whose works most regularly entered into subsequent editions." -- p. 401, ‘Ordering’ Novels

<!-- ## April 17, 2017

Just giving myself credit in beeminder for installing G++ as the next step toward compiling the code mom wrote so I can run it myself.-->

## April 13, 2017

Removed all corpora from the repo online (though keeping them in the directory locally) so I can be usefully organized on my computer without publishing data that I only have for my own research.

Also added the code that mom wrote to start simplifying / cleaning up the publisher names in the ESTC data! It looks like it's going to take some dedicated work manually listing the substitutions, but still much better than manually MAKING the substitutions.

It also doesn't seem to **quite** be working yet...? But I'm sure I can figure out what's wrong.

I HAVE confirmed that I know how to 'join' the two spreadsheets of the full ESTC data and the out.csv file that this program produces! And can work with them both in Tableau! And it's going to be SO HELPFUL!!! :D

## April 10, 2017

It’s one of my key priorities to account for the impact over time of works which cannot extend **back** in influence to before they were written, but most certainly do extend **forward** infinitely; no work is confined to a single moment.

Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.

When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.

(Am I impressed by longevity?? I think what matters to me here is that this is a way that "normal", "average" books have great impact: they form a context/mediascape that only makes sense as a whole.)

## April 5, 2017

Somehow I've crossed over into "writing my chapter" without realising I had anything to say yet! All that playing around with charts was research, apparently. For the first time, I'm feeling good about having a chapter drafted before the end of the year!

## March 31, 2017

Thinking about how ESTC encourages us to see the decade as a network of publishers -- can a given publisher (e.g. Cadell) be taken to represent a "mainstream" set of perspectives, such that that publisher's shifting decisions about what to publish constitute changes in the "mainstream"? Vs a radical publishers (like whoever took Desmond)?

This would be one way for information about publishers to inflect our understanding of individual works -- provides a way to assess the marginality / centrality of the ideas within the Overton Window.

## March 23, 2017

If I want to write on the networks of 18thC publishers, I should see what work already exists, and see if I can convert those existing scholarly models into visualizations of some kind.

TODO: find existing work on social networks of 18thC publishers

## March 17, 2017

I took some time trying to extract individual publishers from the big "publisher" lists (focusing on T. Cadell) -- it looks like it might be a tricky computational problem (or a *month* of manual sitzfleisch), but if all the publishers could be identified it would enable some *really, really cool* modeling of the publishers' relationships with each other (and the connections between authors via their publishers!). It'd definitely be a journal article for me if we could solve it.

Re: the ESTC's model of the decade -- this info really takes the focus away from authors (no individual one of which can really dominate), and puts it on publishers.

Also, re: Charlotte Smith's publishers -- T. Cadell did indeed refuse to publish Desmond because it was too radical!

## March 13, 2017

### Who did Ann Radcliffe publish with?

Ahhhhhh, this chart shows SO WELL a change from Hookham / Hookham & Carpenter to GG&J!

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-3.png?raw=true)

### Who did Hannah More publish with?

Mostly, the Cheap Repository tracks. She has so many, I haven't really detangled all of them...

![chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers.png?raw=true)

But, interestingly, when she's writing different kinds of works, she goes to different publishers:

![excerpt of a chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

### Who did Mary Robinson publish with?

She stuck much less to one person!

![chart of Mary Robinson's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/robinson-publishers.png?raw=true)

### What works were most reprinted?

Well, first I have each individual author's graphs:

![chart of Hannah More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-2.png?raw=true)

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-printings.png?raw=true)

![chart of Mary Robinson's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/robinson-printings.png?raw=true)

![chart of Charlotte Smith's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-printings.png?raw=true)

The ratios / numbers of works by each author are interestingly different, but as the numbers under each title make clear, these charts are not remotely at scale compared to each other!

So here they all are compared:

![chart of four key authors' most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/4-authors-printings.png?raw=true)

That's an awful lot of Hannah More. Let's take her out to better compare the other three:

![chart of three key authors' most reprinted works, minus Hannah More](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/3-authors-printings-noHMore.png?raw=true)

Radcliffe just does not seem all that astonishingly dominant in these views! If she had greater prominence, it must have been through larger print runs, or through greater circulation in circulating libraries.

TODO: track down print run sizes for the works by my four key authors (a big to-do, for sure!)

## March 7, 2017

I think it's introducing needless confusion to be trying to think of things as "chapters" at this stage -- my chapters will need to be shaped by my results!

Instead, to make sure I'm still "writing up as I go", I'll focus on describing each individual experiment and just shove it all into chapter 3 to be organized and subdivided later.

## Feb 27 2017

I made a better version of my Charlotte Smith publisher chart! Much clearer, and also I'm no longer accidentally excluding two of her publishers.

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

------

Study a "sample" of the ESTC that looks at the most prolific authors? Or most-reprinted works? (But it's so labor-intensive to see what's a reprint, given the variability in titles)

## Feb 11 2017

What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.

I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.

![bar chart of More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-bars.png?raw=true)

I also looked at Thomas Paine's most printed works, which seemed to be an awful lot of letters. But I form no interesting hypotheses.

## Feb 10 2017

TABLEAU IS JUST STUPIDLY COOL AND I MADE SO MANY CHARTS AND I AM SO EXCITED

So far I have just pulled the ESTC data in -- I fiddled with making it combine with the ECCO-TCP information but haven't figured it out yet. I've already learned SO MUCH about the ESTC records, though!!

So here we have the number of records per year, during my period:

![graphs of works per year](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/master/figures/estc-tableau/works-per-year.png)
 
TODO: I should compare this to, e.g., Garside, to see if it means anything. Not super exciting as-is.

I decided to look at who was publishing most, and it turned out to be the government:

![bar chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-bars.png?raw=true)

(That's after I filtered out the 11,000+ "null" authors.) I was expecting more of a long-tail kind of curve, but there's a huge cliff after the first four! Probably because the first four are the government, and then the fifth is George III the person (also the government but on a more human scale).

A prettier but not really clearer version trying to contextualize the relative prominence of those government publications:

![squares chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-squares-radcliffe.png?raw=true)

and THEN it was DELIGHTFULLY EASY to filter out everybody whose name began with "Great Britain", resulting in the following:

![bar chart of most prolific authors not named Great Britain](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-not-GB.png?raw=true)

This has much more of the curve I expected. I am still BLOWN AWAY by how TOTALLY UNKNOWN half these names are to me. I had to fight for Hannah More and Oliver Goldsmith on my special fields list! I have never even HEARD of John Wesley!! Who IS he, to be outselling Shakespeare??

...He was one of the founders of Methodism!!! FASCINATING. That puts Thomas Paine up there with two religious writers, nestled between them and the government. And then Shakespeare. WACKY.

I also decided to take a peek at where things are usually published:

![squares chart of publication location](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/place-of-publication.png?raw=true)

They are published in London.

From there I decided to try some much more specific question. First, I looked at the authors associated with any publisher with Minerva in the name (aiming to capture the Minerva Press):

![squares chart of Minerva authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/minerva-authors.png?raw=true)

It was reassuring to *finally* have something with a sensible name at the top of the list: the literary canon is certainly not selecting its 1790s representatives based on popularity, but the academic gossip about the Minerva press has pegged its targets pretty well.

TODO: Is the number of "null" (unsigned) authors associated with the Minerva Press proportionate to the overall number of "null" authors?

I also looked a bit at who Charlotte Smith was publishing with. It took some fiddling to group together entries which were for the same publisher with marginally different spelling or formatting, but it seems that she has a strong allegiance to T. Cadell but occasionally dabbles with others:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers.png?raw=true)

That "2" with G.G.J. is the first printing of Desmond. Why did she publish Desmond with a new publisher, when she had such a longstanding relationship with Cadell? (Cadell's 1789 works include a reprint of her much earlier Elegaic Sonnets, which suggests a long/committed relationship.) J. Bell got The Old Manor House (2 printings) and then The Wanderings of Warwick. Sampson Low got Montalbert, Marchmont, and A Narrative of the Loss of Charlotte. Was she shopping around trying to find homes for her more Gothic material? T Cadell's address is on the Strand -- was he too posh for her sensational tales?

Most of T Cadell's printings are reprints of Elegaic Sonnets or Rural Walks (I should probably read Rural Walks for special fields), but he also printed Emmeline, Ethelinde, and Celestina, so he can't have been *too* opposed to her novels.

## Jan 30 2017

One approach to the ESTC corpus might be to randomly sample 500 items, carefully classify them, and then use those classifications as training to computationally classify the larger list? Maybe with topic modelling?? But everything might be on FAR too tiny a scale for this to be reliable; ask mom. (It would, at least, be possible to *test* my accuracy afterward, by randomly checking a sample of the machine-classified titles to see if I concur..)

Before I get too carried away, I have to figure out what on earth I'm doing with the dates. It seems like many of the texts might not really be from my decade at all, which matters!

## Jan 28 2017

I looked at the ESTC corpus for my newsletter, and should duplicate those thoughts here:

"I have bibliographic metadata on 51,965 works printed in England between 1789-99!! SO EXCITING!!! :D (Thanks, English Short Title Catalogue!) To start, I figured I'd hit it with some extremely blunt tools, and just shoved the big list of the titles of those works into Voyant. Look! A word cloud!

![word cloud of titles of works in ESTC corpus](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud.png?raw=true)

Word clouds are... not very useful. But they're also not very hard! So for a newsletter, why not?

What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:

![two copies of word cloud of ESTC titles, each with some words circled](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud-annotated.png?raw=true)

By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!

This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.

Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:

* A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
* The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &c. In three volumes
* A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P

There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

## Jan 21 2017

Time to freewrite about how my work relates to the critical context!

I am most persuaded that my work has something to offer to the very recent conversation around "surface reading," and other ways of escaping paranoid critique. I think the theoretical principles of modeling, prototyping, and iteration, allow for richness and surprise. cf Heather Love, Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, Cannon Schmitt, and a bit of Eve Sedgwick (also possibly Rita Felski?)

I feel confident that, even if right now my ideas are undeveloped, by the time my project finished I will have produced something of technological/methodological interest to other DH researchers. I think Steven Zwicker's idea of random sampling will bear some fruit for me, and I'd like to model some actually-useful topic modelling with my full text corpora.  Oh! And I think it will be valuable to have a sense of how "representative" the ECCO-TCP corpus is.

What I don't have, right now, is a compelling 18thC question. And my trip to the AGO yesterday really drove home the importance of having one clear, straightforward, hard question which will drive all the tools being used (instead of letting the tools drive inquiry).

How can I narrow down to just one question? How can I know that the question is important? How can I use special fields to make sure that I have chosen the right question?

Why I care about the 18thC: because there's **so much** and it operates on such a different value system. It's always surprising. It's always complicated. And I guess the question I care about is, how can we teach students about the past in a way that makes them understand how complicated humans and history are, makes them more empathetic and thoughtful.

I'm thinking now of Wollstonecraft's Vindication: one could excerpt just her descriptions of the legal status of women, and discuss whether her critiques are accurate and her proposed reforms were reasonable. And then one could excerpt her discussions of class and social hierarchy and ask, what about these?

(But I want to leave room for people in the past to not all perfectly align with my own value system -- I grow more and more convinced of Radcliffe and Austen as socially conservative in many ways)

One of the ideas that was mentioned but not developed at MLA was that, if one wishes to teach principles of justice, if one wishes to turn students' personal distress into pro-social empathy, one must **choose to teach different texts**. So I guess my question is: which eighteenth century texts should we teach? And how?

**Can** that be my question??

---

Egads. The probable outline of the diss right now is:

1. Intro
1. ESTC corpus
1. ECCO-TCP full texts
1. Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson
1. Conclusion

...and Chapter 4 there is basically an entire dissertation. But I don't want to cut any of those authors!! aaagh

## Jan 20 2017

Frustratingly, the ECCO-TCP metadata csv that I have doesn't include publication dates, but according to [this query](http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/philologic4/eccotcp/query?report=bibliography&method=proxy&year=1789-1799&results_per_page=1000&start=0&end=0) at ARTFL‘s PhiloLogic search engine, 502 of the ECCO-TCP texts are from my years 1789-99! That's a pretty respectable corpus! Within the parameters of what I can investigate/classify manually (if only just).

## Jan 16 2017

Time to freewrite about what the hell I am doing here, exactly!

I want to find a way to account for the real *variety* of the period: there is no “average” or “normal” text against which the “exceptional” works can contrast, nor can any text be “representative.” But we still, on a practical level, need to carry on. And surely it is possible to triage.

What is the goal of the field? To triage texts based on their “importance” for students to learn? To triage texts based on the social, emotional, intellectual rewards they provide their readers? Both, obviously, but: how to do either?

(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of *all* literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone *else’s* job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong. So it must be the ways of reading, not the things read, which it is our responsibility to suss out...)

(Can reading from a distance be empathetic? or moral? or reparative?)

What do I want to *find*? What would be an exciting "result"? I'd love to find some better "representative" body of texts, somehow.

The idea of *carrying on*, somehow, despite imperfection and incompleteness: this is what I want to kidnap from other fields. The ability to say, fine, this thing is complicated, so I will begin with a *stupid* model, and then I will look at my stupid model and say, "aha! it is stupid!", and then I will make it incrementally less stupid according to what I learn.

Modelling, and prototyping, as scholarly practices that can help us find the way forward: am I doing this?

I am trying to model the decade 1789-99. I will probably produce several models via iterative prototypes. One of my models will be a "traditional" close-reading based one. Another will be the ESTC catalogue. A third would balance these out nicely! Something with ECCO-TCP full texts, perhaps?

-- the trouble with this is that, although iteration is critical to inquiry, it's only polite to spare one's readers the long journey; I'll want to skip right to my latest, most-developed model.

Why are there people other than Ann Radcliffe in here? -- because I need to model the whole decade in order to contextualize her place within it?

What is Radcliffe's relationship to the "school of Radcliffe"? Does she respond to her school? Who else had schools? If nobody else had schools: that's a BIG DEAL. Why identify a "school"? I take it for granted that the individual members of her school are all, in their own ways, responding to / rewriting her materials according to their own idiosyncratic agendas.

Should my title be something more like "Modelling the mediascape in England, 1789-99"?

## Jan 14 2017

What percentage of books promise in their titles some kind of secret or mystery to be discovered? This is the kind of question that would be more interesting if two different time periods were being compared...

## Jan 13 2017

MLA was a whirlwind! I was surprised to find myself describing an interest in religious and sentimental literature [ETA: **didactic** literature!], singing the praises of Hannah More -- it does reinforce my desire not to treat genres too separately.

I most enjoyed a panel on "anti-marriage plots"-- it made me want to look at what narratologists are up to and how I might dip by toe into that field.

Reading Wolfenbach, Emmeline, Coelebs, and now Clermont, I have been impressed again and again by the importance of, hm, women's duplicity? The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness. I want to read more about the sentimental nove;: it seems like there is a really direct line form there to Radcliffe.

I also want to look back at my MA work a bit more to see if I better understand my own arguments there, now that I have done more actual reading.

It does sometimes feel like I will have no idea what I'm talking about until I've read a hundred 18thC novels... I should make a list of what I've actually rolled my eyes past, and think about some habits of, e.g., using ReadMe! to speed-read more of these. I find that I get a lot out of even a very superficial read of the works as a whole.

## Jan 2 2017

It's been hard to know where to start with this, hard to have a specific enough question that I can be excited about it. I know I want to research and publish individual chapters somewhat separately but I can't do them all at once!

The FIRST chapter I will work on is my 'background' description of what constitutes "normal" during my decade. I'll do this research and turn it into a paper and into my chapter 2.

I’m going to focus on building my database of bibliographic data for all prose, drama, and poetry published in London during the years 1789-99. I’m in talks with a library to get copies of the relevant 52,001 items from their database; I’ll see how many different things I can pile up, and mess with them, and write a description of the literary mediascape in my decade. It’ll be fun!!

I'll definitely want to do this no matter how my other literary questions shake out, so even though it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing (Ann Radcliffe? Charlotte Smith? Hannah More??), I do know how to do this part.

## Dec 23 2016

A question that's very important and interesting to ME, though maybe not to anyone else (???) is, how 'representative' is the ECCO-TCP corpus compared to the ETSC catalog?

(How many of the 2,188 ECCO-TCP texts are even from 1789-99?)

## Dec 20 2016

Trying to come up with a special fields list is increasingly paradoxical: the goal of my research is to assess our methods of selecting "representative" authors, and step one is to... select representative authors. Even focusing on 'touchstones of the canon' leaves me with FAR too much to read.

Also far too much: an eight-chapter dissertation. Maybe I'm looking at too many case studies. Could I just do the 'school of Radcliffe' and the 'school of Charlotte Smith'? Based on the network graph from DHSI last year?

## Dec 10 2016

In correspondence with ETSC, looks like I will be able to have access!

Made a first rough draft of special fields reading list. Currently looking at Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More as my case study authors (plus Radcliffe of course). Unsure about cutting Elizabeth Inchbald and Joanna Baillie... I'd really like to do some experiments and get basic popularity/prevalence numbers before picking case studies. I don't know anything yet! I don't know how to pick anything!! That's why I need corpus analysis! So-- I will read anybody who seems fun and interesting in their own right for as a strong *candidate* for a case study, since I need to do my special fields reading list before the first experiment, but I'm not committing.

Currently thinking a good structure might be:

1. Introduction

1. Chapter 1: data analysis of all of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 2: closer analysis of a randomly-selected subset of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 3: case study 1 - Charlotte Smith

1. Chapter 4: case study 2 - Mary Robinson

1. Chapter 5: case study 3 - Hannah More

1. Chapter 6: Ann Radcliffe time, synthesis

1. Conclusions

Is that too many chapters? That's probably too many chapters.

## Nov 30 2016

The English Short Title Catalogue says there are 51996 titles published in England 1789-1799!! That's a lot. Also, it will only give me information on the first 1001 results?

I'd love to compare against the Richardson/Fielding era but I feel like five years is too short to capture the period I'm interested in (surely I should do all of Radcliffe's ouvre?) and ten years is clearly an ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM.

## Oct 27 2016
Reading Moretti's *Distant Reading*:
* Look up Literary Lab pamphlet 1, "Quantitative Formalism"
* He promised studies of Austen's rivals, and then never did them: can I do it?
* Can I copy his methods of looking for clues in Doyle's competitors to see Radcliffe's success? Does a similar pattern follow for the explained supernatural?
* I, too, am interested in "*rivals*: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (67)
* This book charts Moretti's working-out of the (conflicting?) theories of evolutionary selection and centre-periphery systems, as explanations for literary history. I also care centrally about these questions! They are my driving questions!
* What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (141)
* "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (145)
* The essay "Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles" is VERY EXCITING to me; and I might be one of the only readers who begins this essay already having read the bibliography in question cover-to-cover!

## Oct 22 2016
Reading so many articles. Nothing feels clear or connected. What am I *doing*?

## Oct 21 2016
### Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeare’s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

## Oct 19 2016
What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

## Oct 10 2016
I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

## Oct 8 2016
thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)

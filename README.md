####Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeareâ€™s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)

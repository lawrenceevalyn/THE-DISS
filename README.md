# THE-DISS

## Research Goals
* I want to address, somehow, the use of canons, and consider better ways to contextualize and teach literature
* I want to apply the conceptual frameworks of prototyping and models to literary research

## To Do
* Preliminary Thesis Proposal Nov 1
* I need to do a lot more reading in the 18thC
* put S.D. meeting notes into log
* email T.R. about "intergenre and mixing genre (dramatic novel)" (???)

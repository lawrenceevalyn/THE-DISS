## Research Log

### Dec 10 2016

In correspondence with ETSC.

Made a first rough draft of special fields reading list. Currently looking at Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More as my case study authors (plus Radcliffe of course). Unsure about cutting Elizabeth Inchbald and Joanna Baillie... I'd really like to do some experiments and get basic popularity/prevalence numbers before picking case studies. I don't know anything yet! I don't know how to pick anything!! That's why I need corpus analysis! So-- I will read anybody who seems fun and interesting in their own right for as a strong *candidate* for a case study, since I need to do my special fields reading list before the first experiment, but I'm not committing.

Currently thinking a good structure might be:
1. Introduction
1. Chapter 1: data analysis of all of my ETSC corpus
1. Chapter 2: closer analysis of a randomly-selected subset of my ETSC corpus
1. Chapter 3: case study 1 - Charlotte Smith
1. Chapter 4: case study 2 - Mary Robinson
1. Chapter 5: case study 3 - Hannah More
1. Chapter 6: Ann Radcliffe time, synthesis
1. Conclusions

Is that too many chapters? That's probably too many chapters.

The English Short Title Catalogue says there are 51996 titles published in England 1789-1799!! That's a lot. Also, it will only give me information on the first 1001 results?

I'd love to compare against the Richardson/Fielding era but I feel like five years is too short to capture the period I'm interested in (surely I should do all of Radcliffe's ouvre?) and ten years is clearly an ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM.

Reading Moretti's *Distant Reading*:
* Look up Literary Lab pamphlet 1, "Quantitative Formalism"
* He promised studies of Austen's rivals, and then never did them: can I do it?
* Can I copy his methods of looking for clues in Doyle's competitors to see Radcliffe's success? Does a similar pattern follow for the explained supernatural?
* I, too, am interested in "*rivals*: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (67)
* This book charts Moretti's working-out of the (conflicting?) theories of evolutionary selection and centre-periphery systems, as explanations for literary history. I also care centrally about these questions! They are my driving questions!
* What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (141)
* "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (145)
* The essay "Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles" is VERY EXCITING to me; and I might be one of the only readers who begins this essay already having read the bibliography in question cover-to-cover!

### Oct 22 2016
Reading so many articles. Nothing feels clear or connected. What am I *doing*?

### Oct 21 2016
#### Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeareâ€™s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

### Oct 19 2016
What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

### Oct 10 2016
I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

### Oct 8 2016
thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)

# Research Goals
* I want to address, somehow, the use of canons, and consider better ways to contextualize and teach literature
* I want to apply the conceptual frameworks of prototyping and models to literary research
* I really like the Gothic

# Current Priorities
* Read 18thC texts voraciously, to inform my gut intuition of the period
* Use ESTC data to model the decade 1789-99
* Figure out what question the field of literary study is trying to answer, exactly

# Research Log

## August 4, 2017

Had a good chat with Alyssa about what I'm learning about the French revolution... Some thoughts:

> L: the difference between a bunch of drunken idealists vs a bunch of over-caffeinated idealists.... is madame guillotine

> A: they go to declare war, vibrating, sweating a little, eyes darting everywhere
> A: “are... are you okay” asks the holy roman empire
> A: “IT’S THE REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR” they say, their hair sticking up from all the sweat

> L: it was the summer, they were hot, the haitian revolution had deprived them of all their coffee and sugar, the revolutionaries had nothing left to live for
> A: Oh, caffeine withdrawal, that explains it
> L: everyone was hangry

> A: Have you considered writing your dissertation on the impact of coffee on the french revolution
> Lhonestly... I.... could? I am really interested in the impact of bodily experience throughout all this nonsense. it REALLY DOES make more sense when you remember that everyone is hot, and caffeinated, and hangry
> L: and, like, that’s the crucial flaw in all their enlightenment philosophy, right
> L: they’re rejecting bodily experience as irrelevant
> A: Everybody still has a body and that body needs stuff no matter how loudly they say it doesn’t
> L: right, yeah, and everyone still has emotions too
> L: and if you ignore your body and your feelings, you mis-diagnose yourself -- you are even less rational than your default
> L: you hear about an army deserting, and you feel a lot of things, and you decide “RATIONALLY my feelings must mean TRAITORS ARE EVERYWHERE AND WE MUST MURDER THEM”
> L: or even, like: you murder a bunch of random people, and you feel bad, and you say to yourself “rationally I DON’T feel bad because I am a PATRIOT” and then you murder MORE people when... maybe... those feelings contained important info? vis-a-vis murder?

David's pre- and post-revolutionary paintings get at this problem very well! His dismissal of, and then embrace of, womanly sentiment.

Everybody is still **using** emotions to make arguments, they're just all trying to pretend otherwise.



## August 1, 2017

**IS** there a reason to pre-emptively focus on sustained prose fiction, when evaluating the literary output of a period?? Or to focus on poetry?? WHY are all the bibliographies of novels???

## July 24, 2017

Conspiracy theories play such a huge role in France! The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!

Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

## July 22, 2017

How does all my special fields reading relate to my dissertation?? Is it just that I care about Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson now? I don't think I'm necessarily reading the expressive "variety" that I argue characterizes literary production and needs to be coped with.... things are pretty similar. Does knowing more about the French Revolution help me somehow? I do feel like I HAVE A better "feel" for the period, from having read so much more.... I am especially noticing as a major theme the desperate distress over the operation of "preposession" that I wrote about as an undergrgrad -- I think I was onto something there! Should I foreground "preposession" further, and its relationship to the political philosophy of the day? It definitely seems connected to tyranny -- Even in More's history of Mary Woods, evidence and testimony are utterly useless and the vulnerable have no recourse when subjected to tyranny based in prepossession. This seems like a fruitful philosophical thread!

## July 15, 2017

Reading Claudia Johnson's article "'Let Me Make the Novels of a Country': Barbauld's 'The British Novelists'" was an astonishing and inspiring breath of incredibly incisive research, so closely tied to everything I am interested in re: re-examining the canon, and women in the canon, not from the naive position of replacing the canon with a women now, but from a complex and historically-grounded perspective. Her incisive readings of the agendas of, e.g, Watt and Kiely, too, were just excellent. I want to do that! How do I do that?

Workflow thoughts: do I need, like, a big cork board to physically tack ideas to? To go all What Is The Connection? ... I want to be properly grappling with the difficult-but-rewarding critical work (like the Johnson article) more often, and to *produce* things that I can then use, as a result -- I want to build my thoughts into something... how can I do that other than by spending a month in the woods as a hermit?

## July 7, 2017

WHAT IF I USED TOPIC MODELLING TO LOOK AT FRANK'S GOTHIC TYPES? Maybe there is too little text? But finding words that "mean" the same thing as each other seems like.. what topic modelling is for?

## July 4, 2017

My thinking workflow, I think, involves gathering a bunch of bits in a voracious acquisition mode, and then synthesizing everything in a short burst later. So, I will gather paragraph-sized ideas in writing and in visualizations (rough ones) in scrivener, where I can rearrange them and group them thematically, and then when it's time to make a chapter I'll hide in the woods with indesign for a month to pull it together. 

## July 1, 2017

What is my WORKFLOW? Am I dumping thoughts into Scrivener? Into InDesign?? Into a website? Should I have an outline? A bunch of scraps? I can't figure out how to think all at once about all of the bits and pieces I have flying around!!

## June 16, 2017

Final observations/results from topic modelling titles:

Opening Q: What topics are represented in our scholarly, edited corpora of eighteenth century texts? How do those compare to mass print production in the period?

Method: 50 topic models of titles of ESTC works vs ECCO-TCP, both from 1789-99

Results: As perhaps might have been anticipated, the
ECCO corpus emphasizes “timeless” literary and philosophical works, whereas the ESTC corpus is dominated by “timely” advertisements, government bulletins, and ephemera.

![topic modeling results](THE-DISS/figures/R-topic-models/estc-ecco-topic-comparison-notes.png)

## June 15, 2017

I could (and perhaps should?) write one R program which will go through both my corpora, save wordclouds and topics etc in the desirable locations

## June 14, 2017

Topic modelling works much better on titles than it had any right to, really!

(make sure to describe contents of figure folders, how they were generated, etc)

## June 13, 2017

OMG OMG OMG, topic-model titles of ESTC and then use those topics on the ECCO-TCP documents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## June 6, 2017

Tufte class was great for doing lots of thinking!!

Thoughts about design:
* keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your **content**
* very successful data presentation in news story just... says numbers, when they are needed. not encoded into charts, corralled into special number boxes -- just stated directly.
* a key is a sign you designed something wrong: label things are directly as possible, especially for colour coding
* information at exact point of need
* your comparison should be: put your design in one window, and google maps into a window next to it. once you're done weeping, ask, "why can't I do this?"
* *total indifference to mode of production* is critical. (oh god, I'm going to lay out my whole diss in indesign, aren't I)
* sparkline graphics integrate image and word, have incredible resolution
* use Gill Sans (or maybe Trebuchet) for graphics -- great density

Six principles of design:
1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences
2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemtic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't *do* anything with the information without causality)
3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate
4. *completely integrate* words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc
5. documentation must thorouhgly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales
6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.

Thoughts about my research / dissertation:
* "in studying human behaviour, most 'big data' us repurposed data -- that's not how science works" -- don't repurpose data, collect it, with a focus and for a purpose
* **can** I identify / manipulate cause and effect?
    * I guess my MA question is "does gender cause different kinds of writing"?
* I'm trying to look at **books** -- can I get all the book dots moving around? to show more of my data, more granularly?
    * HOW do I design them?? by hand, in indesign and illustrator???
* My dissertation is to tackled 1789-99. It doesn't matter where my information is FROM, don't do a chapter on ESTC and a chapter on ECCO-TCP, etc!! *See what's there*, and **connect** them in an enormous, rich, multivariate visualization
    * (I will have such a fight with the department over this...)
    * I want to do what Minard did. It would be much harder than writing a lot of words, and much more useful.
* Research Q: *what is the impact of the French Revolution in British literature?* (**lots** of detail to dig into here)
* Research Q: Who is reading what in Britain?
* Tufte **also** thinks 3D is the future... I want to pull the Corvey PDFs into a Unity environment, implement the book properly! I could probably do this myself in a year or two.... **or** I could print out all the books, which would be less share-able but much better for me.
* I need a better data organization process. Maybe, a central location for each little bit, with clear descriptions of what's in there and how it got there? and then a big pile of individual bits of ideas for drafting the diss in... charts-to-self and conclusions-to-self also.
* Research project: systematic meta-analysis of The Literature (and especially what it says about various forms of literary production), in spreadsheet form of coursse

## June 5, 2017

I will be able to do topic modelling on my ECCO-TCP corpus at DHSI!!

"Topics" I'd like to try to find:
- poetry/prose/drama
- Gothic / non-Gothic
- men / women

All of those would be "use some training texts -- see if they're accurate on the main corpus" uses of topic modelling; I should try to find my training texts in advance...

## May 26, 2017

As I read McLeod's dissertation, I am almost overwhelmed by how much work she did and how much she is investigating exactly the kinds of things that interest me -- I keep meaning to look quickly through it for the key points, but I get sucked in.

## May 22, 2017

I have a LOT of ideas about my research questions from talking with Jakob this weekend, and don't want to formally, though I hesitate to "publish" them even this much! I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???


## May 15, 2017

Can I use some of the stuff I'm doing for Shakespeare for this dissertation?? Maybe the theatrical social network modelling? (How can I tell when two research ideas are part of the same.. idea?)

## May 11, 2017

IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability

Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?

## May 8, 2017

Is the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here? Am I interested in the novel as a form at all? Why is everyone else so interested in the novel to the exclusion of other literary forms???

Am I interested in the poetry, actually? How can I see which generic form dominates the decade?

## April 29, 2017

Picking up my MA research again has really re-energized my desire to work with a range of bibliographies for the decade -- it's a short enough period that I don't actually have to rely on the ESTC, and really I don't want the ESTC to take on too much authority/prominence

Already have: ESTC, Ann Tracy, Frederick Frank. Should add: Garside bib of the novel, Franz Potter's bib of bluebooks. Should find: something for plays! something for poetry! something for pamphlets??!

## April 22, 2017

Info on publishers, answering my earlier questions, from Garside!

"By the 1790s it was not unusual for authors to change publishers, in seeking out advantages, Charlotte Smith switching between Cadell, Robinson, John Bell, and Sampson Low; Ann Radcliffe moving from Thomas Hookham (at the higher end of the circulating library trade) to publish The Mysteries of Udolpho with Robinson and The Italian (1797) with Cadell, the former advertised as comprising ‘four very large volumes’ and both set a premium price. Almost invariably it was such authors who managed to claim larger payments and whose works most regularly entered into subsequent editions." -- p. 401, ‘Ordering’ Novels

<!-- ## April 17, 2017

Just giving myself credit in beeminder for installing G++ as the next step toward compiling the code mom wrote so I can run it myself.-->

## April 13, 2017

Removed all corpora from the repo online (though keeping them in the directory locally) so I can be usefully organized on my computer without publishing data that I only have for my own research.

Also added the code that mom wrote to start simplifying / cleaning up the publisher names in the ESTC data! It looks like it's going to take some dedicated work manually listing the substitutions, but still much better than manually MAKING the substitutions.

It also doesn't seem to **quite** be working yet...? But I'm sure I can figure out what's wrong.

I HAVE confirmed that I know how to 'join' the two spreadsheets of the full ESTC data and the out.csv file that this program produces! And can work with them both in Tableau! And it's going to be SO HELPFUL!!! :D

## April 10, 2017

It’s one of my key priorities to account for the impact over time of works which cannot extend **back** in influence to before they were written, but most certainly do extend **forward** infinitely; no work is confined to a single moment.

Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.

When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.

(Am I impressed by longevity?? I think what matters to me here is that this is a way that "normal", "average" books have great impact: they form a context/mediascape that only makes sense as a whole.)

## April 5, 2017

Somehow I've crossed over into "writing my chapter" without realising I had anything to say yet! All that playing around with charts was research, apparently. For the first time, I'm feeling good about having a chapter drafted before the end of the year!

## March 31, 2017

Thinking about how ESTC encourages us to see the decade as a network of publishers -- can a given publisher (e.g. Cadell) be taken to represent a "mainstream" set of perspectives, such that that publisher's shifting decisions about what to publish constitute changes in the "mainstream"? Vs a radical publishers (like whoever took Desmond)?

This would be one way for information about publishers to inflect our understanding of individual works -- provides a way to assess the marginality / centrality of the ideas within the Overton Window.

## March 23, 2017

If I want to write on the networks of 18thC publishers, I should see what work already exists, and see if I can convert those existing scholarly models into visualizations of some kind.

TODO: find existing work on social networks of 18thC publishers

## March 17, 2017

I took some time trying to extract individual publishers from the big "publisher" lists (focusing on T. Cadell) -- it looks like it might be a tricky computational problem (or a *month* of manual sitzfleisch), but if all the publishers could be identified it would enable some *really, really cool* modeling of the publishers' relationships with each other (and the connections between authors via their publishers!). It'd definitely be a journal article for me if we could solve it.

Re: the ESTC's model of the decade -- this info really takes the focus away from authors (no individual one of which can really dominate), and puts it on publishers.

Also, re: Charlotte Smith's publishers -- T. Cadell did indeed refuse to publish Desmond because it was too radical!

## March 13, 2017

### Who did Ann Radcliffe publish with?

Ahhhhhh, this chart shows SO WELL a change from Hookham / Hookham & Carpenter to GG&J!

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers.png?raw=true)

Of course, one could also consider Hookham, Carpenter, and Hookham & Carpenter together:

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

TODO: research whether it makes sense to separate those publishers or merge them!

The chronological shift also tracks by title:

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers by work](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers-titles.png?raw=true)

### Who did Charlotte Smith publish with?

This chart method also makes Charlotte Smith's history even easier to see:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-3.png?raw=true)

### Who did Hannah More publish with?

Mostly, the Cheap Repository tracks. She has so many, I haven't really detangled all of them...

![chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers.png?raw=true)

But, interestingly, when she's writing different kinds of works, she goes to different publishers:

![excerpt of a chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

### Who did Mary Robinson publish with?

She stuck much less to one person!

![chart of Mary Robinson's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/robinson-publishers.png?raw=true)

### What works were most reprinted?

Well, first I have each individual author's graphs:

![chart of Hannah More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-2.png?raw=true)

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-printings.png?raw=true)

![chart of Mary Robinson's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/robinson-printings.png?raw=true)

![chart of Charlotte Smith's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-printings.png?raw=true)

The ratios / numbers of works by each author are interestingly different, but as the numbers under each title make clear, these charts are not remotely at scale compared to each other!

So here they all are compared:

![chart of four key authors' most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/4-authors-printings.png?raw=true)

That's an awful lot of Hannah More. Let's take her out to better compare the other three:

![chart of three key authors' most reprinted works, minus Hannah More](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/3-authors-printings-noHMore.png?raw=true)

Radcliffe just does not seem all that astonishingly dominant in these views! If she had greater prominence, it must have been through larger print runs, or through greater circulation in circulating libraries.

TODO: track down print run sizes for the works by my four key authors (a big to-do, for sure!)

## March 7, 2017

I think it's introducing needless confusion to be trying to think of things as "chapters" at this stage -- my chapters will need to be shaped by my results!

Instead, to make sure I'm still "writing up as I go", I'll focus on describing each individual experiment and just shove it all into chapter 3 to be organized and subdivided later.

## Feb 27 2017

I made a better version of my Charlotte Smith publisher chart! Much clearer, and also I'm no longer accidentally excluding two of her publishers.

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

------

Study a "sample" of the ESTC that looks at the most prolific authors? Or most-reprinted works? (But it's so labor-intensive to see what's a reprint, given the variability in titles)

## Feb 11 2017

What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.

I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.

![squares chart of More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-squares.png?raw=true)

![bar chart of More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-bars.png?raw=true)

I also looked at Thomas Paine's most printed works, which seemed to be an awful lot of letters. But I form no interesting hypotheses.

![squares chart of Paine's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/paine-printings-squares.png?raw=true)

![bar chart of Paine's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/paine-printings-bars.png?raw=true)

## Feb 10 2017

TABLEAU IS JUST STUPIDLY COOL AND I MADE SO MANY CHARTS AND I AM SO EXCITED

So far I have just pulled the ESTC data in -- I fiddled with making it combine with the ECCO-TCP information but haven't figured it out yet. I've already learned SO MUCH about the ESTC records, though!!

So here we have the number of records per year, during my period:

![graphs of works per year](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/master/figures/estc-tableau/works-per-year.png)
 
TODO: I should compare this to, e.g., Garside, to see if it means anything. Not super exciting as-is.

I decided to look at who was publishing most, and it turned out to be the government:

![bar chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-bars.png?raw=true)

(That's after I filtered out the 11,000+ "null" authors.) I was expecting more of a long-tail kind of curve, but there's a huge cliff after the first four! Probably because the first four are the government, and then the fifth is George III the person (also the government but on a more human scale).

A prettier but not really clearer version trying to contextualize the relative prominence of those government publications:

![squares chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-squares-radcliffe.png?raw=true)

and THEN it was DELIGHTFULLY EASY to filter out everybody whose name began with "Great Britain", resulting in the following:

![bar chart of most prolific authors not named Great Britain](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-not-GB.png?raw=true)

This has much more of the curve I expected. I am still BLOWN AWAY by how TOTALLY UNKNOWN half these names are to me. I had to fight for Hannah More and Oliver Goldsmith on my special fields list! I have never even HEARD of John Wesley!! Who IS he, to be outselling Shakespeare??

...He was one of the founders of Methodism!!! FASCINATING. That puts Thomas Paine up there with two religious writers, nestled between them and the government. And then Shakespeare. WACKY.

I also decided to take a peek at where things are usually published:

![squares chart of publication location](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/place-of-publication.png?raw=true)

They are published in London.

From there I decided to try some much more specific question. First, I looked at the authors associated with any publisher with Minerva in the name (aiming to capture the Minerva Press):

![squares chart of Minerva authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/minerva-authors.png?raw=true)

It was reassuring to *finally* have something with a sensible name at the top of the list: the literary canon is certainly not selecting its 1790s representatives based on popularity, but the academic gossip about the Minerva press has pegged its targets pretty well.

TODO: Is the number of "null" (unsigned) authors associated with the Minerva Press proportionate to the overall number of "null" authors?

I also looked a bit at who Charlotte Smith was publishing with. It took some fiddling to group together entries which were for the same publisher with marginally different spelling or formatting, but it seems that she has a strong allegiance to T. Cadell but occasionally dabbles with others:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers.png?raw=true)

That "2" with G.G.J. is the first printing of Desmond. Why did she publish Desmond with a new publisher, when she had such a longstanding relationship with Cadell? (Cadell's 1789 works include a reprint of her much earlier Elegaic Sonnets, which suggests a long/committed relationship.) J. Bell got The Old Manor House (2 printings) and then The Wanderings of Warwick. Sampson Low got Montalbert, Marchmont, and A Narrative of the Loss of Charlotte. Was she shopping around trying to find homes for her more Gothic material? T Cadell's address is on the Strand -- was he too posh for her sensational tales?

Most of T Cadell's printings are reprints of Elegaic Sonnets or Rural Walks (I should probably read Rural Walks for special fields), but he also printed Emmeline, Ethelinde, and Celestina, so he can't have been *too* opposed to her novels.

## Jan 30 2017

One approach to the ESTC corpus might be to randomly sample 500 items, carefully classify them, and then use those classifications as training to computationally classify the larger list? Maybe with topic modelling?? But everything might be on FAR too tiny a scale for this to be reliable; ask mom. (It would, at least, be possible to *test* my accuracy afterward, by randomly checking a sample of the machine-classified titles to see if I concur..)

Before I get too carried away, I have to figure out what on earth I'm doing with the dates. It seems like many of the texts might not really be from my decade at all, which matters!

## Jan 28 2017

I looked at the ESTC corpus for my newsletter, and should duplicate those thoughts here:

"I have bibliographic metadata on 51,965 works printed in England between 1789-99!! SO EXCITING!!! :D (Thanks, English Short Title Catalogue!) To start, I figured I'd hit it with some extremely blunt tools, and just shoved the big list of the titles of those works into Voyant. Look! A word cloud!

![word cloud of titles of works in ESTC corpus](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud.png?raw=true)

Word clouds are... not very useful. But they're also not very hard! So for a newsletter, why not?

What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:

![two copies of word cloud of ESTC titles, each with some words circled](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud-annotated.png?raw=true)

By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!

This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.

Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:

* A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
* The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &c. In three volumes
* A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P

There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

## Jan 21 2017

Time to freewrite about how my work relates to the critical context!

I am most persuaded that my work has something to offer to the very recent conversation around "surface reading," and other ways of escaping paranoid critique. I think the theoretical principles of modeling, prototyping, and iteration, allow for richness and surprise. cf Heather Love, Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, Cannon Schmitt, and a bit of Eve Sedgwick (also possibly Rita Felski?)

I feel confident that, even if right now my ideas are undeveloped, by the time my project finished I will have produced something of technological/methodological interest to other DH researchers. I think Steven Zwicker's idea of random sampling will bear some fruit for me, and I'd like to model some actually-useful topic modelling with my full text corpora.  Oh! And I think it will be valuable to have a sense of how "representative" the ECCO-TCP corpus is.

What I don't have, right now, is a compelling 18thC question. And my trip to the AGO yesterday really drove home the importance of having one clear, straightforward, hard question which will drive all the tools being used (instead of letting the tools drive inquiry).

How can I narrow down to just one question? How can I know that the question is important? How can I use special fields to make sure that I have chosen the right question?

Why I care about the 18thC: because there's **so much** and it operates on such a different value system. It's always surprising. It's always complicated. And I guess the question I care about is, how can we teach students about the past in a way that makes them understand how complicated humans and history are, makes them more empathetic and thoughtful.

I'm thinking now of Wollstonecraft's Vindication: one could excerpt just her descriptions of the legal status of women, and discuss whether her critiques are accurate and her proposed reforms were reasonable. And then one could excerpt her discussions of class and social hierarchy and ask, what about these?

(But I want to leave room for people in the past to not all perfectly align with my own value system -- I grow more and more convinced of Radcliffe and Austen as socially conservative in many ways)

One of the ideas that was mentioned but not developed at MLA was that, if one wishes to teach principles of justice, if one wishes to turn students' personal distress into pro-social empathy, one must **choose to teach different texts**. So I guess my question is: which eighteenth century texts should we teach? And how?

**Can** that be my question??

---

Egads. The probable outline of the diss right now is:

1. Intro
1. ESTC corpus
1. ECCO-TCP full texts
1. Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson
1. Conclusion

...and Chapter 4 there is basically an entire dissertation. But I don't want to cut any of those authors!! aaagh

## Jan 20 2017

Frustratingly, the ECCO-TCP metadata csv that I have doesn't include publication dates, but according to [this query](http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/philologic4/eccotcp/query?report=bibliography&method=proxy&year=1789-1799&results_per_page=1000&start=0&end=0) at ARTFL‘s PhiloLogic search engine, 502 of the ECCO-TCP texts are from my years 1789-99! That's a pretty respectable corpus! Within the parameters of what I can investigate/classify manually (if only just).

## Jan 16 2017

Time to freewrite about what the hell I am doing here, exactly!

I want to find a way to account for the real *variety* of the period: there is no “average” or “normal” text against which the “exceptional” works can contrast, nor can any text be “representative.” But we still, on a practical level, need to carry on. And surely it is possible to triage.

What is the goal of the field? To triage texts based on their “importance” for students to learn? To triage texts based on the social, emotional, intellectual rewards they provide their readers? Both, obviously, but: how to do either?

(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of *all* literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone *else’s* job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong. So it must be the ways of reading, not the things read, which it is our responsibility to suss out...)

(Can reading from a distance be empathetic? or moral? or reparative?)

What do I want to *find*? What would be an exciting "result"? I'd love to find some better "representative" body of texts, somehow.

The idea of *carrying on*, somehow, despite imperfection and incompleteness: this is what I want to kidnap from other fields. The ability to say, fine, this thing is complicated, so I will begin with a *stupid* model, and then I will look at my stupid model and say, "aha! it is stupid!", and then I will make it incrementally less stupid according to what I learn.

Modelling, and prototyping, as scholarly practices that can help us find the way forward: am I doing this?

I am trying to model the decade 1789-99. I will probably produce several models via iterative prototypes. One of my models will be a "traditional" close-reading based one. Another will be the ESTC catalogue. A third would balance these out nicely! Something with ECCO-TCP full texts, perhaps?

-- the trouble with this is that, although iteration is critical to inquiry, it's only polite to spare one's readers the long journey; I'll want to skip right to my latest, most-developed model.

Why are there people other than Ann Radcliffe in here? -- because I need to model the whole decade in order to contextualize her place within it?

What is Radcliffe's relationship to the "school of Radcliffe"? Does she respond to her school? Who else had schools? If nobody else had schools: that's a BIG DEAL. Why identify a "school"? I take it for granted that the individual members of her school are all, in their own ways, responding to / rewriting her materials according to their own idiosyncratic agendas.

Should my title be something more like "Modelling the mediascape in England, 1789-99"?

## Jan 14 2017

What percentage of books promise in their titles some kind of secret or mystery to be discovered? This is the kind of question that would be more interesting if two different time periods were being compared...

## Jan 13 2017

MLA was a whirlwind! I was surprised to find myself describing an interest in religious and sentimental literature [ETA: **didactic** literature!], singing the praises of Hannah More -- it does reinforce my desire not to treat genres too separately.

I most enjoyed a panel on "anti-marriage plots"-- it made me want to look at what narratologists are up to and how I might dip by toe into that field.

Reading Wolfenbach, Emmeline, Coelebs, and now Clermont, I have been impressed again and again by the importance of, hm, women's duplicity? The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness. I want to read more about the sentimental nove;: it seems like there is a really direct line form there to Radcliffe.

I also want to look back at my MA work a bit more to see if I better understand my own arguments there, now that I have done more actual reading.

It does sometimes feel like I will have no idea what I'm talking about until I've read a hundred 18thC novels... I should make a list of what I've actually rolled my eyes past, and think about some habits of, e.g., using ReadMe! to speed-read more of these. I find that I get a lot out of even a very superficial read of the works as a whole.

## Jan 2 2017

It's been hard to know where to start with this, hard to have a specific enough question that I can be excited about it. I know I want to research and publish individual chapters somewhat separately but I can't do them all at once!

The FIRST chapter I will work on is my 'background' description of what constitutes "normal" during my decade. I'll do this research and turn it into a paper and into my chapter 2.

I’m going to focus on building my database of bibliographic data for all prose, drama, and poetry published in London during the years 1789-99. I’m in talks with a library to get copies of the relevant 52,001 items from their database; I’ll see how many different things I can pile up, and mess with them, and write a description of the literary mediascape in my decade. It’ll be fun!!

I'll definitely want to do this no matter how my other literary questions shake out, so even though it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing (Ann Radcliffe? Charlotte Smith? Hannah More??), I do know how to do this part.

## Dec 23 2016

A question that's very important and interesting to ME, though maybe not to anyone else (???) is, how 'representative' is the ECCO-TCP corpus compared to the ETSC catalog?

(How many of the 2,188 ECCO-TCP texts are even from 1789-99?)

## Dec 20 2016

Trying to come up with a special fields list is increasingly paradoxical: the goal of my research is to assess our methods of selecting "representative" authors, and step one is to... select representative authors. Even focusing on 'touchstones of the canon' leaves me with FAR too much to read.

Also far too much: an eight-chapter dissertation. Maybe I'm looking at too many case studies. Could I just do the 'school of Radcliffe' and the 'school of Charlotte Smith'? Based on the network graph from DHSI last year?

## Dec 10 2016

In correspondence with ETSC, looks like I will be able to have access!

Made a first rough draft of special fields reading list. Currently looking at Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More as my case study authors (plus Radcliffe of course). Unsure about cutting Elizabeth Inchbald and Joanna Baillie... I'd really like to do some experiments and get basic popularity/prevalence numbers before picking case studies. I don't know anything yet! I don't know how to pick anything!! That's why I need corpus analysis! So-- I will read anybody who seems fun and interesting in their own right for as a strong *candidate* for a case study, since I need to do my special fields reading list before the first experiment, but I'm not committing.

Currently thinking a good structure might be:

1. Introduction

1. Chapter 1: data analysis of all of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 2: closer analysis of a randomly-selected subset of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 3: case study 1 - Charlotte Smith

1. Chapter 4: case study 2 - Mary Robinson

1. Chapter 5: case study 3 - Hannah More

1. Chapter 6: Ann Radcliffe time, synthesis

1. Conclusions

Is that too many chapters? That's probably too many chapters.

## Nov 30 2016

The English Short Title Catalogue says there are 51996 titles published in England 1789-1799!! That's a lot. Also, it will only give me information on the first 1001 results?

I'd love to compare against the Richardson/Fielding era but I feel like five years is too short to capture the period I'm interested in (surely I should do all of Radcliffe's ouvre?) and ten years is clearly an ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM.

## Oct 27 2016
Reading Moretti's *Distant Reading*:
* Look up Literary Lab pamphlet 1, "Quantitative Formalism"
* He promised studies of Austen's rivals, and then never did them: can I do it?
* Can I copy his methods of looking for clues in Doyle's competitors to see Radcliffe's success? Does a similar pattern follow for the explained supernatural?
* I, too, am interested in "*rivals*: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (67)
* This book charts Moretti's working-out of the (conflicting?) theories of evolutionary selection and centre-periphery systems, as explanations for literary history. I also care centrally about these questions! They are my driving questions!
* What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (141)
* "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (145)
* The essay "Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles" is VERY EXCITING to me; and I might be one of the only readers who begins this essay already having read the bibliography in question cover-to-cover!

## Oct 22 2016
Reading so many articles. Nothing feels clear or connected. What am I *doing*?

## Oct 21 2016
### Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeare’s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

## Oct 19 2016
What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

## Oct 10 2016
I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

## Oct 8 2016
thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)

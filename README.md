### Who did Ann Radcliffe publish with?

Ahhhhhh, this chart shows SO WELL a change from Hookham / Hookham & Carpenter to GG&J!

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers.png?raw=true)

Of course, one could also consider Hookham, Carpenter, and Hookham & Carpenter together:

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

TODO: research whether it makes sense to separate those publishers or merge them!

The chronological shift also tracks by title:

### Who did Charlotte Smith publish with?

This chart method also makes Charlotte Smith's history even easier to see:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-3.png?raw=true)

### Who did Hannah More publish with?

Mostly, the Cheap Repository tracks. She has so many, I haven't really detangled all of them...

![chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers.png?raw=true)

But, interestingly, when she's writing different kinds of works, she goes to different publishers:

![excerpt of a chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

## March 7, 2017

I think it's introducing needless confusion to be trying to think of things as "chapters" at this stage -- my chapters will need to be shaped by my results!

Instead, to make sure I'm still "writing up as I go", I'll focus on describing each individual experiment and just shove it all into chapter 3 to be organized and subdivided later.

## Feb 27 2017

I made a better version of my Charlotte Smith publisher chart! Much clearer, and also I'm no longer accidentally excluding two of her publishers.

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

------

Study a "sample" of the ESTC that looks at the most prolific authors? Or most-reprinted works? (But it's so labor-intensive to see what's a reprint, given the variability in titles)

## Feb 11 2017

What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.

I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.

![bar chart of More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/more-printings-bars.png?raw=true)

I also looked at Thomas Paine's most printed works, which seemed to be an awful lot of letters. But I form no interesting hypotheses.

## Feb 10 2017

TABLEAU IS JUST STUPIDLY COOL AND I MADE SO MANY CHARTS AND I AM SO EXCITED

So far I have just pulled the ESTC data in -- I fiddled with making it combine with the ECCO-TCP information but haven't figured it out yet. I've already learned SO MUCH about the ESTC records, though!!

So here we have the number of records per year, during my period:

![graphs of works per year](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/master/figures/estc-tableau/works-per-year.png)
 
TODO: I should compare this to, e.g., Garside, to see if it means anything. Not super exciting as-is.

I decided to look at who was publishing most, and it turned out to be the government:

![bar chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-bars.png?raw=true)

(That's after I filtered out the 11,000+ "null" authors.) I was expecting more of a long-tail kind of curve, but there's a huge cliff after the first four! Probably because the first four are the government, and then the fifth is George III the person (also the government but on a more human scale).

A prettier but not really clearer version trying to contextualize the relative prominence of those government publications:

![squares chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-squares-radcliffe.png?raw=true)

and THEN it was DELIGHTFULLY EASY to filter out everybody whose name began with "Great Britain", resulting in the following:

![bar chart of most prolific authors not named Great Britain](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-not-GB.png?raw=true)

This has much more of the curve I expected. I am still BLOWN AWAY by how TOTALLY UNKNOWN half these names are to me. I had to fight for Hannah More and Oliver Goldsmith on my special fields list! I have never even HEARD of John Wesley!! Who IS he, to be outselling Shakespeare??

...He was one of the founders of Methodism!!! FASCINATING. That puts Thomas Paine up there with two religious writers, nestled between them and the government. And then Shakespeare. WACKY.

I also decided to take a peek at where things are usually published:

![squares chart of publication location](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/place-of-publication.png?raw=true)

They are published in London.

From there I decided to try some much more specific question. First, I looked at the authors associated with any publisher with Minerva in the name (aiming to capture the Minerva Press):

![squares chart of Minerva authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/minerva-authors.png?raw=true)

It was reassuring to *finally* have something with a sensible name at the top of the list: the literary canon is certainly not selecting its 1790s representatives based on popularity, but the academic gossip about the Minerva press has pegged its targets pretty well.

TODO: Is the number of "null" (unsigned) authors associated with the Minerva Press proportionate to the overall number of "null" authors?

I also looked a bit at who Charlotte Smith was publishing with. It took some fiddling to group together entries which were for the same publisher with marginally different spelling or formatting, but it seems that she has a strong allegiance to T. Cadell but occasionally dabbles with others:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers.png?raw=true)

That "2" with G.G.J. is the first printing of Desmond. Why did she publish Desmond with a new publisher, when she had such a longstanding relationship with Cadell? (Cadell's 1789 works include a reprint of her much earlier Elegaic Sonnets, which suggests a long/committed relationship.) J. Bell got The Old Manor House (2 printings) and then The Wanderings of Warwick. Sampson Low got Montalbert, Marchmont, and A Narrative of the Loss of Charlotte. Was she shopping around trying to find homes for her more Gothic material? T Cadell's address is on the Strand -- was he too posh for her sensational tales?

Most of T Cadell's printings are reprints of Elegaic Sonnets or Rural Walks (I should probably read Rural Walks for special fields), but he also printed Emmeline, Ethelinde, and Celestina, so he can't have been *too* opposed to her novels.

## Jan 30 2017

One approach to the ESTC corpus might be to randomly sample 500 items, carefully classify them, and then use those classifications as training to computationally classify the larger list? Maybe with topic modelling?? But everything might be on FAR too tiny a scale for this to be reliable; ask mom. (It would, at least, be possible to *test* my accuracy afterward, by randomly checking a sample of the machine-classified titles to see if I concur..)

Before I get too carried away, I have to figure out what on earth I'm doing with the dates. It seems like many of the texts might not really be from my decade at all, which matters!

## Jan 28 2017

I looked at the ESTC corpus for my newsletter, and should duplicate those thoughts here:

"I have bibliographic metadata on 51,965 works printed in England between 1789-99!! SO EXCITING!!! :D (Thanks, English Short Title Catalogue!) To start, I figured I'd hit it with some extremely blunt tools, and just shoved the big list of the titles of those works into Voyant. Look! A word cloud!

![word cloud of titles of works in ESTC corpus](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud.png?raw=true)

Word clouds are... not very useful. But they're also not very hard! So for a newsletter, why not?

What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:

![two copies of word cloud of ESTC titles, each with some words circled](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud-annotated.png?raw=true)

By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!

This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.

Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:

* A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
* The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &c. In three volumes
* A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P

There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

## Jan 21 2017

Time to freewrite about how my work relates to the critical context!

I am most persuaded that my work has something to offer to the very recent conversation around "surface reading," and other ways of escaping paranoid critique. I think the theoretical principles of modeling, prototyping, and iteration, allow for richness and surprise. cf Heather Love, Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, Cannon Schmitt, and a bit of Eve Sedgwick (also possibly Rita Felski?)

I feel confident that, even if right now my ideas are undeveloped, by the time my project finished I will have produced something of technological/methodological interest to other DH researchers. I think Steven Zwicker's idea of random sampling will bear some fruit for me, and I'd like to model some actually-useful topic modelling with my full text corpora.  Oh! And I think it will be valuable to have a sense of how "representative" the ECCO-TCP corpus is.

What I don't have, right now, is a compelling 18thC question. And my trip to the AGO yesterday really drove home the importance of having one clear, straightforward, hard question which will drive all the tools being used (instead of letting the tools drive inquiry).

How can I narrow down to just one question? How can I know that the question is important? How can I use special fields to make sure that I have chosen the right question?

Why I care about the 18thC: because there's **so much** and it operates on such a different value system. It's always surprising. It's always complicated. And I guess the question I care about is, how can we teach students about the past in a way that makes them understand how complicated humans and history are, makes them more empathetic and thoughtful.

I'm thinking now of Wollstonecraft's Vindication: one could excerpt just her descriptions of the legal status of women, and discuss whether her critiques are accurate and her proposed reforms were reasonable. And then one could excerpt her discussions of class and social hierarchy and ask, what about these?

(But I want to leave room for people in the past to not all perfectly align with my own value system -- I grow more and more convinced of Radcliffe and Austen as socially conservative in many ways)

One of the ideas that was mentioned but not developed at MLA was that, if one wishes to teach principles of justice, if one wishes to turn students' personal distress into pro-social empathy, one must **choose to teach different texts**. So I guess my question is: which eighteenth century texts should we teach? And how?

**Can** that be my question??

---

Egads. The probable outline of the diss right now is:

1. Intro
1. ESTC corpus
1. ECCO-TCP full texts
1. Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson
1. Conclusion

...and Chapter 4 there is basically an entire dissertation. But I don't want to cut any of those authors!! aaagh

## Jan 20 2017

Frustratingly, the ECCO-TCP metadata csv that I have doesn't include publication dates, but according to [this query](http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/philologic4/eccotcp/query?report=bibliography&method=proxy&year=1789-1799&results_per_page=1000&start=0&end=0) at ARTFL‘s PhiloLogic search engine, 502 of the ECCO-TCP texts are from my years 1789-99! That's a pretty respectable corpus! Within the parameters of what I can investigate/classify manually (if only just).

## Jan 16 2017

Time to freewrite about what the hell I am doing here, exactly!

I want to find a way to account for the real *variety* of the period: there is no “average” or “normal” text against which the “exceptional” works can contrast, nor can any text be “representative.” But we still, on a practical level, need to carry on. And surely it is possible to triage.

What is the goal of the field? To triage texts based on their “importance” for students to learn? To triage texts based on the social, emotional, intellectual rewards they provide their readers? Both, obviously, but: how to do either?

(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of *all* literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone *else’s* job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong. So it must be the ways of reading, not the things read, which it is our responsibility to suss out...)

(Can reading from a distance be empathetic? or moral? or reparative?)

What do I want to *find*? What would be an exciting "result"? I'd love to find some better "representative" body of texts, somehow.

The idea of *carrying on*, somehow, despite imperfection and incompleteness: this is what I want to kidnap from other fields. The ability to say, fine, this thing is complicated, so I will begin with a *stupid* model, and then I will look at my stupid model and say, "aha! it is stupid!", and then I will make it incrementally less stupid according to what I learn.

Modelling, and prototyping, as scholarly practices that can help us find the way forward: am I doing this?

I am trying to model the decade 1789-99. I will probably produce several models via iterative prototypes. One of my models will be a "traditional" close-reading based one. Another will be the ESTC catalogue. A third would balance these out nicely! Something with ECCO-TCP full texts, perhaps?

-- the trouble with this is that, although iteration is critical to inquiry, it's only polite to spare one's readers the long journey; I'll want to skip right to my latest, most-developed model.

Why are there people other than Ann Radcliffe in here? -- because I need to model the whole decade in order to contextualize her place within it?

What is Radcliffe's relationship to the "school of Radcliffe"? Does she respond to her school? Who else had schools? If nobody else had schools: that's a BIG DEAL. Why identify a "school"? I take it for granted that the individual members of her school are all, in their own ways, responding to / rewriting her materials according to their own idiosyncratic agendas.

Should my title be something more like "Modelling the mediascape in England, 1789-99"?

## Jan 14 2017

What percentage of books promise in their titles some kind of secret or mystery to be discovered? This is the kind of question that would be more interesting if two different time periods were being compared...

## Jan 13 2017

MLA was a whirlwind! I was surprised to find myself describing an interest in religious and sentimental literature [ETA: **didactic** literature!], singing the praises of Hannah More -- it does reinforce my desire not to treat genres too separately.

I most enjoyed a panel on "anti-marriage plots"-- it made me want to look at what narratologists are up to and how I might dip by toe into that field.

Reading Wolfenbach, Emmeline, Coelebs, and now Clermont, I have been impressed again and again by the importance of, hm, women's duplicity? The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness. I want to read more about the sentimental nove;: it seems like there is a really direct line form there to Radcliffe.

I also want to look back at my MA work a bit more to see if I better understand my own arguments there, now that I have done more actual reading.

It does sometimes feel like I will have no idea what I'm talking about until I've read a hundred 18thC novels... I should make a list of what I've actually rolled my eyes past, and think about some habits of, e.g., using ReadMe! to speed-read more of these. I find that I get a lot out of even a very superficial read of the works as a whole.

## Jan 2 2017

It's been hard to know where to start with this, hard to have a specific enough question that I can be excited about it. I know I want to research and publish individual chapters somewhat separately but I can't do them all at once!

The FIRST chapter I will work on is my 'background' description of what constitutes "normal" during my decade. I'll do this research and turn it into a paper and into my chapter 2.

I’m going to focus on building my database of bibliographic data for all prose, drama, and poetry published in London during the years 1789-99. I’m in talks with a library to get copies of the relevant 52,001 items from their database; I’ll see how many different things I can pile up, and mess with them, and write a description of the literary mediascape in my decade. It’ll be fun!!

I'll definitely want to do this no matter how my other literary questions shake out, so even though it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing (Ann Radcliffe? Charlotte Smith? Hannah More??), I do know how to do this part.

## Dec 23 2016

A question that's very important and interesting to ME, though maybe not to anyone else (???) is, how 'representative' is the ECCO-TCP corpus compared to the ETSC catalog?

(How many of the 2,188 ECCO-TCP texts are even from 1789-99?)

## Dec 20 2016

Trying to come up with a special fields list is increasingly paradoxical: the goal of my research is to assess our methods of selecting "representative" authors, and step one is to... select representative authors. Even focusing on 'touchstones of the canon' leaves me with FAR too much to read.

Also far too much: an eight-chapter dissertation. Maybe I'm looking at too many case studies. Could I just do the 'school of Radcliffe' and the 'school of Charlotte Smith'? Based on the network graph from DHSI last year?

## Dec 10 2016

In correspondence with ETSC, looks like I will be able to have access!

Made a first rough draft of special fields reading list. Currently looking at Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More as my case study authors (plus Radcliffe of course). Unsure about cutting Elizabeth Inchbald and Joanna Baillie... I'd really like to do some experiments and get basic popularity/prevalence numbers before picking case studies. I don't know anything yet! I don't know how to pick anything!! That's why I need corpus analysis! So-- I will read anybody who seems fun and interesting in their own right for as a strong *candidate* for a case study, since I need to do my special fields reading list before the first experiment, but I'm not committing.

Currently thinking a good structure might be:

1. Introduction

1. Chapter 1: data analysis of all of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 2: closer analysis of a randomly-selected subset of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 3: case study 1 - Charlotte Smith

1. Chapter 4: case study 2 - Mary Robinson

1. Chapter 5: case study 3 - Hannah More

1. Chapter 6: Ann Radcliffe time, synthesis

1. Conclusions

Is that too many chapters? That's probably too many chapters.

## Nov 30 2016

The English Short Title Catalogue says there are 51996 titles published in England 1789-1799!! That's a lot. Also, it will only give me information on the first 1001 results?

I'd love to compare against the Richardson/Fielding era but I feel like five years is too short to capture the period I'm interested in (surely I should do all of Radcliffe's ouvre?) and ten years is clearly an ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM.

## Oct 27 2016
Reading Moretti's *Distant Reading*:
* Look up Literary Lab pamphlet 1, "Quantitative Formalism"
* He promised studies of Austen's rivals, and then never did them: can I do it?
* Can I copy his methods of looking for clues in Doyle's competitors to see Radcliffe's success? Does a similar pattern follow for the explained supernatural?
* I, too, am interested in "*rivals*: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (67)
* This book charts Moretti's working-out of the (conflicting?) theories of evolutionary selection and centre-periphery systems, as explanations for literary history. I also care centrally about these questions! They are my driving questions!
* What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (141)
* "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (145)
* The essay "Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles" is VERY EXCITING to me; and I might be one of the only readers who begins this essay already having read the bibliography in question cover-to-cover!

## Oct 22 2016
Reading so many articles. Nothing feels clear or connected. What am I *doing*?

## Oct 21 2016
### Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeare’s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

## Oct 19 2016
What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

## Oct 10 2016
I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

## Oct 8 2016
thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)

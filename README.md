# Next-do: do revisions for rest of committee

# Thesis Map
Map of the thesis at this stage:
1.  Theoretical groundings
2.  Comparison of digital corpora
3.  Use these corpora to discuss popularity
4.  Publishing networks
5.  Use these networks to discuss mainstream / non-mainstream printing (another take on popularity)
6.  Coda or afterword on the Gothic?

# Writing Principles
* Don't be precious about preserving previous drafts. Cannibalize them and move on. It's okay for things to be left behind. (Git has my historical record.)
* Remember that I'm not trying to write to undergrads.
* Finish the figures right away.

# Reference:

*Useful regex*: \$c1789|\$c179[0123456789]  --  matches all my years in MARC

non-MARC version: 1789|179[0123456789]

# Research Log

## April 30, 2019

I requested a bunch of books on Charlotte Smith from OhioLink! It will be kind of hilarious to me if I finally start actually *using books* for my research only after I've left my library behind, haha

## April 28, 2019

Not planning to show a chapter to the full committee until September, now, but I want to do more than finish Ch 1 by then.... I'm feeling really poorly grounded in 18thC lit (again).

In the onsen it seemed like a good next step to dive really deep into research on Charlotte Smith's print publication history, and to make a spreadsheet of all print-historical claims I found about her. I'd definitely like to do this for Hannah More, but I think I like Charlotte Smith more so I'd rather start there... but it looks like the basic starting places there are all physical books that'll take some work to acquire. Made a preliminary list. Not a lot of monographs on her!

## April 12, 2019

aaaagh when will I have time to work on this

## April 9, 2019

Worth doing another whole pass of revisions before going on to T & T:
1. section on 1790s: rearrange around the idea of "print magic" and "cultural capital" and trash & treasure
-- how 1790s has been defined in terms of canons
-- works without cultural capital have been "rescued" via print culture / print magic frameworks
-- rearrange around canons: I'm going to talk in a very well-established way that draws on a lot of things from the 80s
--- have to actually read Bourdieu's field of etc
-- also just flag some interest in the gothic and female authors -- use them as my examples, gothic for canons and hannah more for print magic

2. gothic and queerness section need to be actually finished
-- first make the argument that the gothic is actually important to the 1790s

3. very end: just remove the networks bit?

actually do have to address Nan Da - just use this as an excuse to write my response to her

how to address the problem that I'm not actually interested in politics? current project is interesting to DH and book history people, can it still be interesting to 18thC people?
-- just eliminate that section on printers because maybe I don't need that section of the diss
-- gender??
-- politics was in there in the first place because it's a way people try to recapture these texts
-- maybe after 2 chapters of corpus analysis I will see a better way to approch women and gothic writing

(I was surprised by how tender and scared I felt, facing down these revisions, even though I do think the chapter and diss are pretty good and gonna get better. I think it's because it became actually real, and this is something that's actually important... so I think these feelings are a natural part of the process, and a symptom of how much this matters to me, and therefore something to accept as part of the process.)

## April 8, 2019

The more I look over my chapter, the more I really want to dig in and start taking & examining my random samples from each corpus. I want to know what I am dealing with!! Which means deciding, definitively, how *large* my samples should be...

Do I have to write about Nan Da? I don't really like the way Nan Da is carrying out her critique. I really prefer, e.g., Bode. I'll ask Alex.


## April 5, 2019

March has ended, and I have neither written the gothic section, nor has Alex provided comments on the rest of the doc... I don't love feeling like everything is going so slowly.

After last year's CSECS, I was excited to have some real, meaningful results for this year -- but I only feel farther away from completing some solid experimentatin. I don't know what I'll present this year! Maybe Tom Jones, because it's all I have?? Or a seminar paper that I don't think will ever become a journal article, just to have a unique line on my CV... like that Ruin/Ozymandias paper??? Something on Belvidera....??

## March 12, 2019

Meeting with Alex was really invigorating and reassuring! And we have a plan:
* Alex comments on rest of doc by end of March (nudge her)
* I write gothic section by end of March
* When her comments are done, we will meet to triage -- what comments need to be addressed before sending to Terry & Tom?
* Send to Terry and Tom end of April
* We'll all meet and decide what to do next, early May

Also, I ran some quick numbers on the demographics of my citations so far, and I was surprised by two things:
1. Only 42% of the authors I cite are women, despite me thinking of it as ‘female dominated’.
2. 20% of the authors I cite are nonwhite, despite me thinking of it as ‘completely white’.
Both of these facts, I think, very shaped by the fact that my 1790s section is currently a very long list of a bunch of white dudes (and *one* woman who publishes under her initials), who outnumber the smaller list of more-important thinkers in my DH and theory sections. Accordingly, I’m going to spend some time diversifying my reading in the 1790s; I think I’m probably missing an important scholarly conversation somewhere in there. Maybe it’s even *not about Wordsworth*.

Places to start: whatever A.C. Facundo cites; post-colonial DH? (I basically don't know poco at all... start with the 'big names'. Said??)

## February 28, 2019

Generating this chapter at incredible speed is, I think, *working*, but hoo boy is it also a bit bizarre. There's so much to do...!!

I think it would be useful to make an annotated bibliography of all the 18thC monographs I've read -- that might help me pull them together conceptually... I still feel like I hardly know what the field IS or what it's trying to do. I'll try it, anyway-- after I've finished drafting based on what I've got!

## February 7, 2019

I realised that, actually, the best way for me to have a 9,000 word "competent chapter draft" ready for March 1 while ALSO keeping my work with federated fandom as a high priority would be to go ahead and shove a rough draft of all of my theoretical groundings onto paper. I was leaving that chapter for last because I hate writing introductions, and because I know I'll discover more theorists etc as part of the research process so I know I'll need to rewrite the chapter at the end -- but it IS the part where I already know pretty much everything I'd want to say, and, well, it's also a of stuff that nobody else on my committee already knows so it probably IS helpful to get it out of my head for their benefit. I already wrote a thousand words of it today!! It feels good to be generating WORDS. And then I can continue taking the experimentation for chapter 2 very slow-and-steady.

## February 2, 2019

Okay, reading is nice and all, but it's time to START EXPERIMENTING! I'm going to take my random samples of 100 TODAY!!!

Hahahaha, and *immediately*, even though this is the "easy way" to answer my question, it's way more complicated than it seems and I have a ton of methodological questions. Most importantly: should I use random.org's "sequence generator" or its "integer generator"?

HEY, THE PRINT FUNCTION CHANGED, I DIDN'T AGREE TO THIS

Talking to Tina and Alyssa, I've decided to use the "sequence generator" for my fandom numbers, because duplicates don't even make any sense and what matters is that I have an appropriate sample size. 

## January 28, 2019

It's just occurred to me that, since I will evaluate the accuracy of my algorithmic attempts to identify reprints by comparing their results to my random sample, I can *do the random sample first.* And then (minimum viable product-style!) I can just stop with the random sample if it turns out to tell me what I need!

## January 27, 2019

Much less scared of Mee's book not that I'm far enough in to see where I can offer completely different material and methods, esp. re: women and fiction.

Sorted out my notes & highlights in DevonThink. Still need to set things up in dropbox... I don't understand DevonThink's database structure at all. Possibly I will use it *and* Papers...?

---

I think filling my head with more dates from the 1790s will help. I need a central location to stash this kind of info. I could make a timeline? Options: Preceden; Timeglider; Temporis. Or I could just make a spreadsheet... Regardless, I should try learning them in Anki.

## January 22, 2019

I've started to read Mee's book! And also started trying to actually use DevonThink, which it's clear I need to do more fiddling with to get a proper notetaking workflow going... but which I think will reward that investment.

Step 1, confirm that I can sync my notes & highlights from the Highlights app.

Step 2, set up the database in Dropbox so it's not hogging my whole hard drive.

## January 21, 2019

I think I struggle to prioritize work that isn't collaborative. I especially struggle to FINISH work that isn't collaborative. I think this is really my biggest hurdle with the diss right now -- anything that's just "for me" ends up lowest priority, and the diss is just for me. Maybe I can work on improving in this area in 2019. (Or gamify it to *make* it collaborative??)

## January 18, 2019

A whole bunch of new titles from Cambridge UP that look interesting and relevant! Especially John Mee's book on the 1790s, which is almost perfectly apropos!!

## January 17, 2019

I know exactly what I need to do for several weeks of work in a row, I just need to go and **do** it...

## January 6, 2019

I've been poking away at writing the lit review, and I just opened a ticket to access the High Performance Computing cluster! It's like I'm actually creating a dissertation!

## December 13, 2018

I've created the monster combo-ECCO file! Now to filter out duplicates and empty columns...

Unfortunately it's too large to easily open in OpenRefine on my own laptop. I've finally reached the scale where I need high performance computing! I pinged Alex for access to UTM's cluster.

### So, how exactly am I going to identify reprints, anyway?

I think I have to hack something together in Python.

Useful guide to python libraries: https://blog.ouseful.info/2017/09/04/simple-text-analysis-using-python-identifying-named-entities-tagging-fuzzy-string-matching-and-topic-modelling/

I **do**, I think, want to be on the lookout for titles that identify themselves as second or third editions of someting.. but I don't want to rely on this.

*What data output am I looking for?* I think, a list of titles, and next to each title, the number of times it was reprinted, and the years in which it was reprinted.

How can I identify whether something has existed prior to 1789? Can I compare to pre-1789 ECCO? Can I use some central resource, like wikipedia or worldcat, to identify a first printing for works? Worldcat doesn't look like it will really be useful for this.

Random sampling seems insufficient for this... but I really do want to know how many works printed in the 90s were actually written in the 90s. That's one of my core questions.

If my reprint-identifier **works** I could run it on the whole ECCO/ESTC corpus, but that seems like more than they'd want to give me access to...

MARC fields 245 and 250 include the word "edition". 500 has some additional info on these editions.

MARC field 752 is where I can filter to only look at England.

I don't have enough information from ESTC to find reprints via this method -- should I ask them for more? Maybe, after I have it working on ECCO...?

If the method achieves an accuracy of 85%+ I won’t bother with trying to fuzzy-match titles? How can I decide what accuracy I need?

Then next step is to identify which of these reprinted works are multi-reprints of the same work, which will require some kind of fuzzy title matching… unless it’s small enough for me to to manually (unlikely)

(For ages I've been wondering how in the world I was ever going to publish anything from my dissertation, since all of it is just noodling around in spreadsheets for my own amusement, and then I started outlining this project and then suddenly realised that this whole experiment is absolutely a conference paper, and it will have real and relevant findings! I can't imagine publishing from my diss because I haven't done the *research* yet, but after I have more than justa bunch of questions it will fall into place just as much as the Shakespeare project did. Highly reassuring!)

## December 12, 2018

Poking around in the ECCO files to try to figure out how to merge them and clean them up. It looks like SOME records are duplicated between the gigantic ECCO[no number] and the ECCO1, ECCO2, ECCO2A files, but possibly not all records. I think the best approach is to get final clean CSVs of all four, and then combine them, and then look for & merge duplicates.

UNFORTUNATELY it seems that ECCO stores its most important info in fields that are not standardized!!! So I guess the best way to find ALL of it is actually just to yank every number from 1 to 999 and see which ones have data. >:|

## December 3, 2018

Going to see that terrible Robin Hood movie has brought it to my attention that the "stealing from the rich to give to the poor" aspect of the Robin Hood story (which it actually from like the 14thC) was added in 1795 by Joseph Ritson!

It's weird to me that I haven't really heard of him. He hasn't even been added as a "person" in the MARC records for ECCO or ESTC for his Robin Hood volumes.

## December 2, 2018

Apparently ECCO includes 5,689 titles with their size listed as "1 sheet", all of which seem to have ESTC numbers, so in addition to books and booklets I am also studying broadsheets! This may even include ephemera (what **is** ephemera, really?) so I guess it's true when I say "all printed material".

It seems that the 1-sheet stuff is a lot of extremely practical lists, deathbed speeches, SOME songs but not as many as I expected, breaking news, complaints about breaking news, petitions to the government, and a whole bunch of other stuff.

## November 29, 2018

Feeling reinvigorated after meeting with Terry -- I think I've done more work and thinking than I'd realised, even though it all seems barely-begun.

These are the two concrete experiments that will make up my "popularity" section:
1. Computationally identify reprints in the ESTC
    1. Take a random sample for which I attempt to locate size of print run
    1. Come up with a number that would be a "lot" of reprints vs "not a lot" (to gauge popularity generally)
    1. Compare most-reprinted texts overall to inclusions in smaller archives
    1. Close-read something interesting that gets reprinted (Paine vs Wordsworth? Something that emerges?)
1. Topic-model subject matter of titles
    1. Develop some kind of ontology of topic that encompasses "everything" (sticking to 18thC frameworks of, e.g., history vs romance)
    1. Take a random sample to see how accurate titles are to contents overall
    1. Count how many works of each topic appear in each archive -- what kinds of content has been excluded in each, esp. in ECCO-TCP
    1. Make my own guesses as to what the print landscape was like, and what this means (close-read something interesting that emerges, perhaps works that misrepresent their contents)
1. Draw some overall conclusions
    1. What is a "normal" footprint in the print culture of this decade? (i.e., what are the boundaries a work has to surpass to be unusually popular or unusually unpopular?)
    1. Which of these archives are the most "reliable", and which the most "distorted"? (obvs interrogate this framework)

### Transcript of meeting notes:

What HAVE I been doing?

basically have my data, am dithering a little

I think I can ID reprints? + topic model titles to cluster subgenres? > these are my big experiments?

random sample check title against contents

topic model titles reveals blurriness of period itself

defining parameters -- _not_ excerpts [i.e., don't worry about works that get reprinted in periodicals or excerpted]

lack of reprints != lack of popularity

just use a _few_ print run numbers

* ask Tom where to find print run numbers?

introduction: intentionally using / turning to DH + old school bibliography to fill each other's gaps

## November 12, 2018

OK, went through and reviewed some of my research questions and the issue tracker -- very reassuring that I'm making meaningful progress.

## November 10, 2018

Reading has been assuaging my anxieties-- I can see now who I might want to quote and when, which gives actual context for what I should focus the data comparisons on.

Also, I should probably go through and make the issue-tracker more accurate to my open questions.

## October 23, 2018

I think I'm feeling so unmoored from the 18thC scholarly conversation because I just haven't... really been reading 18thC scholarship. So I think I'm going to put the experimentation on the backburner a little, and focus on actually reading all the recommendations that Terry & Tom have given me.

### Notes from meeting with Alex

Dissertation timeline:
* Write out a detailed plan of the work ahead of me, and an explanation for why I'm going to do the reading I'm going to do next
* Make the spreadsheet in which I will record my reading notes
* Oct 31: send Alex the directed reading plan
* Early Nov: meet with Alex
* Nov: read!
* Late Nov: meet with Terry
* Churn through the data processing & experimenting during the winter
* Finish writing chapter 2 by July
* Write chapter 3 based on the same experimentation during the fall
* Second round of experimentation
* Write chs 4 & 5 over the summer

Limit my non-diss work!
* Can only work on gothic-motifs if I'm prepared to workship it with lab in early Jan; if it takes longer than that, need to let go of it.
* Can only present at conferences if it's diss work.
* I do NOT need to add "service" to my CV.

## October 5, 2018

This is a helpful guide to finding ECCO-TCP files: https://shgregg.com/2017/08/16/finding-ecco-tcp-texts/

It doesn't seem like anyone has available a list of *just* what's in the ECCO-TCP; the closest I can come is the TCP-titles csv which includes EEBO and Evans TCP texts as well, and has no publisher info.

When getting publisher location data from ECCO, the ECCO1 slice of the corpus doesn't include catalog location info in the original MARC file so I use publisher's imprint instead :(

### My horrible MARC > OpenRefine workflow

Tools > Export Tab Delimited Data
choose commas as delimiter
Make sure to select fields / subfields!!!
(can "load" settings to grab the same fields as previously; "basics" settings are just 100 and 260, to get author and publisher.)

## October 3, 2018

Getting demographic info from ESTC yesterday was trivially easy; doing it with ECCO MARC files today is a nightmare.

By using MarcEdit to "export to OpenRefine" and then opening the resulting file as JSON, I can work with it one subfield per row, but this it's wholly functional. Because publication date & publication year are in the same row (260) I can filter by pub year and then look at pub location (for my London %), but with the data in this format I can't filter by years and then look at anything else (like author, or ESTC number, etc) -- and I don't want to be working with ALL of ECCO!

## September 29, 2018

Not going to look at British Library Labs for CSECS after all -- time is running short, and excluding it will be an easy way to simplify my work. And it's the least "exciting" of the six, since it's the one I've heard of the least.

## September 23, 2018

Considered, but ruled out, WorldCat -- can only see results if there's a search term, no way to get everything matching date & location

## September 18, 2018

Got ECCO MARC records from U of T!!! Now I just need to figure out how to open and read MARC records. But I'm sure they contain the information I want!

MarcEdit lets me "break" them so I can at least read them in TextEdit.

I think I've started to figure out ECCO'S MARC records!

001 stores ESTC number, though without leading numbers
i.e., =001  N836 (MARC) correlates to ESTC Number:N000836 (online)

260 c stores publication year
i.e., =260  […] $c (MARC) correlates to Imprint:[…] 1733 (online)

## September 16, 2018

I can't believe I used to do all this without OpenRefine!!! It's so helpful for data cleaning.

cheat sheet: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Recipes

And the regex I use the most, to delete stuff:

value.replace(/[THING-TO-DELETE]/,'')

If I wanna actually replace:

value.replace(/[THING-TO-REMOVE]/,'THING-TO-ADD').

Today I've just been poking at metadata the bare minimum necessary to guess at how many 1790s texts they likely contain, and trying to remember that I'll need to re-do things meticulously once I begin asking my actual questions of the archives I've decided to study. So I need to remember not to trust rough-adelaide-authors.csv or rough-90s-flattened-book-data.csv (hence my decision to add "rough" to their names just now).

Also useful ref: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine

## September 8, 2018

The primary methodological challenge to the questions I would like to pose is the standard makeup of these academic resources: self-contained databases, which are searchable for individual materials but not queryable for overall statistics. (I'd love to know the distribution-by-year of everything in the databases as a whole, but that may be beyond my scope.)

What I'm trying to do, essentially, is to forcibly "join" all of those databases -- the ESTC is my best bet so far, it looks like, for unique keys.
A true "standard" is probably both unfeasible and undesirable. So what can be usefully done with things that follow different standards? I think the answer might be OpenRefine, which I haven't seen extolled enough.

...I begin to think that this "semantic web" of "open linked data" via "RDF" that I've seen librarians talking about all the time.... is the answer. Which means I need to figure out how to use Twinkle to use SPARQL to query RDF data?

In THEORY I should be able to link multiple sources of RDF data, right? Without having to go through and apply a universal "key" like I would for an SQL database? I wonder.... how.

## June 26, 2018

### 18thC word vectors
  - [ECCO](http://ryanheuser.org/data/word2vec.ECCO.skipgram_n=10.model.txt.gz). Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), “Literature and Language,” 1700-99, with 1.9 billion words and trained using word2vec with skip-gram size of 10 words
  - [ECCO20](https://archive.org/details/word-vectors-18c-word2vec-models-across-20-year-periods). ECCO split in twenty-year periods of 18C, with 150 million words each and trained using word2vec with skip-gram size of 10 words
  - [ECCO-TCP](http://ryanheuser.org/data/word2vec.ECCO-TCP.txt.zip). ECCO with 80 million words trained using skip-gram size of 5 words. Also available for [size of 10 words](http://ryanheuser.org/data/word2vec.ECCO-TCP.skipgram_n=10.txt.zip).

It would be really interesting to use word vectors to quantify corpora bias as per DH2018 workshop

## May 15, 2018

https://omnia.sas.upenn.edu/story/prospecting-playbills

Can I ask Michael Gamer to let me transcribe the playbills from 1789-99 in exchange for using all their info in my diss…? It is VERY exciting to me that this project is happening and I want to be a part of it..

## April 23

Been puttering away on the thesis proposal bit by bit and feeling better and better about it. Every time I finally read some secondary criticsm, it is enormously illuminating and invigorating: how can I dramatically increase the rate at which I do so...?

## April 2

A new, more focused structure! With a second main experiment! Need to be careful about scope creep with the networks; prototype it, and then abandon in favour of some kind of stylometry if it's too much sitzfleisch.

I feel like I could go forth and write the whole thing, pretty much, which is a *great* feeling. Now to write up the proposal in pretty prose for Tom's feedback! (Which will probably cause it to change again, which will be a *good* thing that I should resist feeling frustrated by, since it will be improving / deepening my thinking.)

## March 20, 2018

Feeling so good after that meeting!! Excited and energized!

Ongoing warning: I’m not trying to talk to undergrads, so I don’t need to debunk undergrad misperceptions. Read more secondary literature. Email Terry for books more often!

---

Full notes dump from meeting:

All my terms (seriousness, timelessness, etc) are reasons a work might be canonized — clarifies my interests by ‘zooming out’ to the framework of the canon
What is the print landscape of the 1790s actually like? As opposed to our filtered versions via academics, subsequent generations of writers
TL Cowan etc - how do you actually do recuperative/reparative work on archives
Looking at digital corpora the way that people look at anthologies, classroom teaching, etc; talk about why it’s important to know this, becase this is what we all refer to now
Celebrity: easy to say a woman was famous but then forgotten, but once I have my corpora etc I can meaningfully ask how famous they were; but stick just to the 1790s, and not get into questions that will require engagement with the 19thC. (Can I figure how, comparatively, how famous people are in the ebbs and flows of the 1790s)
Why the 1790s? 18thC and Romanticism introduce the idea of canons becoming thematized; collecting shakespeare, milton, english vernavular tradition posited against a classical past. ALSO: POLITICS. Also the Gothic. Also women, including political women. (But stay away from seeing Romanticism as starting here; I’d have to do a lot of work to justify to scholars the beginning of Romanticism in the 1790s)
Suggested chapter: DH study of the popular/mainstream press; recover contemporary printing practices; chapbooks and religious tracts; look at celebrity via print culture — just “what was most popular during the day, according to what they’re showing us” (draw this out as its own chapter). But how do you prove popularity? Why does one corpus show one popuar thing, and another show another. Do our major corpora just show us what the major publishing houses published? (Bring my questions about celebrity and reprinting into this chapter)
Something on politics: chapter on the radical press, which is something else entirely. Pamphlets, essays, periodicals. Engage with an exciting and burgeoning field. Joseph-Johnson Circle: printed Wollstonecraft & Paine. Think about individual printers as having political allegiances; radical publishers. Dissenting societies. My question is: who was publishing? Are we not seeing these text? Conservative works/responses overrepresented in the corpora? Social network graphs?? Authors choosing publishers strageically. Coterie publishing? Inchbald’s The Massacre circulated in manuscript, not published…. Alternative print markets and alternative circulation. (Complicate the story of popularity?) Radical Underworld monograph. —— And how to ethically engage with things that circulated intentionally under the radar, intentionally trying not to be collected into some big systematized database? Or maybe I undo the argument that this was happening surreptitiously/underground?
A lot of my questions aren’t quite about canons, they’re about ARCHIVES, which are related but without the idea of cultural capital; do our archives just reflect our canons? — Marisett - how the dewey decimal system systematically excludes african american authors of the 20thC — data production (of course it’s really all capta — the things you choose, and also the things that are made available for capture; shaped by choices and by constraints)
Is it even possible to get back to that initial moment before the archive formation began? I’m going to try! Undoing the misperception of what we begin with “before” the archive, and the perception of what is produced by DH

Who was actually printing what? Booksellers and print culture from a DH angle

Gothic: synthesize popular and political? Radcial novels are often Gothic; but Gothic is also highly popular/mainstream. Not just a simple fusion of mass and racial media, but something there? Gothic as a mode or material that people want to have an inherent political content, but in fact it can be used for any agenda, it can be used for various forms… but there’s a lot that can’t be reshaped? Repackages radical themes to be mass accessible (melodrama?)? — Re-read Gary Kelley’s Jacobin Novel; something on melodrama

TITLE:  (1790s English) Print Politics in the Digital Archive

Map of the thesis at this stage:
	1.	Introduction: archive formation!
	2.	Comparison of digital corpora (write this first)
	3.	Ok, now how can I use these corpora to ask again what the print landscape of the 1790s actually looked like?
	⁃	Mainstream press?
	⁃	Radical press? Is it actually surreptitious/marginal?
[Something something the Gothic? (Will develop as the earlier parts develop) — but don’t put this in the proposal set]
TODO: Slot all the bits that I don’t want to lose into this new structure

Ongoing warning: I’m not trying to talk to undergrads, so I don’t need to debunk undergrad misperceptions. Read more secondary literature. Email Terry for books more often!

Mention that I am writing my own code, and that I think it’s crucial to read code and critique its algorithmic assumptions. Very explicit about methods. 2015 NSF report on reproducibility of research. My methods have to be able to explain how they are trustworthy.
(Put datasets in open access — T-space? Cultural Analytics?)
(Can generate a lot of words on methods section — but don’t bury in appendices? Instead put it in methods sections? 10,000 words, not 40,000 words. Remember that Terry is the audience.)

To read: Alan Liu — read his work on Romantic canonization; try to meet him? Him and the editors of Romantic Circles are the godfathers of DH and Romanticism. Just had one in PMLA about disjunction between DH and literary critics, how we frame questions and results
Stephen Berhrendt? Editor of Romantic Circles?

Meet as soon as possible, by early April, with a new version. First send a next draft, then we’ll meet.

Got notes on thesis proposal from Alex, and almost feel silly that I didn't already have a section explicitly saying "the thing that I am doing is about canons"

Sent the thesis proposal to Terry... immediately starting to feel worried about whether she will absolutely hate it. But, well -- it's okay if she does; I can ask her to tell me what she would change, evaluate those suggestions, and adapt. I don't know everythng yet -- I'm only trying to point myself in the direction of interesting questions that I'll start knowing answers to later.

## January 29, 2018

Great meeting with Alex today -- soothed many of my anxieties, esp. re: fields debrief.

Takeaways: this is a DH-centric dissertation that is trying to nonetheless win over non-DH people; I want to be an 18thC scholar on the job market.

My interest is basically critical algorithm studies, interested in women and the novel at the end of the 18thC, with a gender & sexuality bent to it what will inform my work without being an explicit part of my conversations with Terry & Tom.

Side project thought: while I am figuring out what's in all my corpora, I should look for works that claim to be translated from Arabic, to start accumulating data for a future project with those materials.

### Transcription of meeting notes

novels, women, late 18thC, critical algorithm studies (--> Avery Slater), lit crit as algorithmic

my job in the thesis: prove that spreadsheets can answer Qs for people who think spreadsheets are the worst

once we have the shape, it'll be easy to produce -- but the shape will be difficult. this is contested space that people dislike -- until they don't. when's that changeover?

ask a Q multiple ways

## January 26, 2018

Lots more stuff on the HathiTrust UnCamp is below, but I think the real takeaway is the way that it has shifted my dissertation interests:

### Consistency and confidence in the million book library
David Minmo

What the computational tools we use with big libraries ACTUALLY do — why they’re powerful and why (misleading)

Point wise mutual information
Topic models
K means clustering
— second order tools

But what we really want is to create a model — a miniature that orients us, possibly from a different perspective

Moldy strawberries: we only throw away the moldy ones. So if a model is flawed, don’t throw away the whole thing. — but does this entirely apply? You DO throw away 

#### Theory: frequency and correlation

Optimist: “it’s ok to have noisy data if it’s big data because it averages out” but big data is just lots and lots of small data

First order models just the words; second order models look at words appearing together

#### How do we find patterns?

Trying to find what math calls a basis: simple components that can combine complexly/richly — represent all observations as combinations of components

Bases: three directions in 3D space; primary colors

Matt Jockers LDA buffet asserts that author’s mix set concepts together (like pride + prejudice + zombies) — eg topics

(I think i disagree with this model because I don’t think certain aesthetic considerations count as topics.....??)

#### Are patterns reliable?

We are interested in a subset of the patterns that exist — the ones that aren’t ocr errors

Bootstrapping : checking the reliability by re-running your process with random samples

Ranking similarities highly variable — #1 the first time likely to still be in top 5 in other runs, but the first #5 result could be #25 second time you run it

If you do 20-25 bootstrap samples they converge on something more stable

#### Can we affect which patterns are found?

Topic modeling science fiction mostly cluster around character names; it tells us authorship but we already know that

Goal: find patterns that do not just correlate with known variables

Can’t just remove words that only appear in 1 author — 2 people wrote dune. Can’t do only appearing in 2 authors because lots of people have characters named Paul...

The problem isn’t that we don’t want to know about appearance of the word desert; Problem is that we want to know more about desert than that it appears in dune

Thresholds for “overuse”: bring outliers down to hypothesis thresholds

Drop max partition proportion : topics no longer dominated by just one author 

#### closing

All sorts of tools are really just word concurrence

Don’t trust one model. Averaging over ~20 models on slightly varied datasets provides good info about reliability

Modification to model input can have predictable effects (we can make progress)

HathiTrust full of problems but why work on anything else?

### Use Cases

#### talk 1

how can people figure out what is there? how to encourage social sciences uses? call numbers are not enough -- only 45% have call number.

Trying to produce summaries

Make a database with MARC records, trying to find gaps and fill them with other sources (mostly OCLC APIs)
Four classifications to create dictionaries: LC subject headings, LCCN (social science codes), Dewey Decimal (social science casses), UDC (social science classes)

What is a duplicate? They took one vol of multivolume works; considered all editions of a work to be the same thing -- I want to treat eds and vols as unique but not copies of the same ed & vol... I also want to reason outward from implied volumes (like vol 1 of Anna St Ives)

deduplication approach: volume ID + discipine + OCLC

They kept duplicate records that had multiple classifications

(They appear to be trying to identify works that are *about* the social sciences, which doesn't seem to me to be something that would be useful *to* social scientists?)

#### talk 2: quantifying descriptiveness of writing
Sayan Bhattacharyya

immediate context: undergraduate classrooms; teaching computational thinking

"show, don't tell" doesn't work when you're writing about a context your readers can't interpret; you have to just tell them what things mean

#### talk 3: UC ClioMetric History Project
studying histories of universities

uccliometric.org

working with semi-structured information like student registers (unlike unstructured novels); relative position is very important and valuable

Formatted Optical Character Recognition

Very helpful that the works in question have been scanned several times; for one register, they have 5 scans, which they OCR with 4 different programs (plus Hathi's OCR), and then compare

build a database for each transcription, of each person who appeared; link where on the page records appeared; remove all but the highest-quality of each person's record; end up with a very high quality database

their database: everyone who has gone to uni in California; also course catalogs, faculty, professional directories (teachers, doctors, etc) -- 1900 to 1960! This is an INCREDIBLE resource

working on student transcripts post 1946

UC Berkeley published annual statistics -- major discrepencies at the world wars which seems to reflect actual differences in how two parts of the university calculated the info; their methods stunningly effective

##### my takeaway: the role of domain expertise is to design/locate good points of comparison to contextualize and validate experimental results

(training name-gender-guesser based on social security data)

"name score": first names capture a lot of information about the social class of their parents
- all UC students were above-average in class
- female students tended to be higher income than male
- stanford higher income than berkeley, after about 1910s when they implemented and then raised tuition; exaggerates the impact of women's higher income
(capturing what parental income was a necessary prerequisite for attendance -- women needed to have more resources behind them to make itto college, esp when then college is more expensive)

(This seems to me to be a MUCH MUCH better case study for HathiTrust's relevance to the social sciences)

#### talk 4

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184188

We show how faceted search using a combination of traditional classification systems and mixed-membership topic models can go beyond keyword search to inform resource discovery, hypothesis formulation, and argument extraction for interdisciplinary research. Our test domain is the history and philosophy of scientific work on animal mind and cognition. The methods can be generalized to other research areas and ultimately support a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structures. We provide a case study for the application of the methods to the problem of identifying and extracting arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform resource discovery in this domain. Through a novel approach of “drill-down” topic modeling—simultaneously reducing both the size of the corpus and the unit of analysis—we are able to reduce a large collection of fulltext volumes to a much smaller set of pages within six focal volumes containing arguments of interest to historians and philosophers of comparative psychology. The volumes identified in this way did not appear among the first ten results of the keyword search in the HathiTrust digital library and the pages bear the kind of “close reading” needed to generate original interpretations that is the heart of scholarly work in the humanities. Zooming back out, we provide a way to place the books onto a map of science originally constructed from very different data and for different purposes. The multilevel approach advances understanding of the intellectual and societal contexts in which writings are interpreted.

### Hands-On Module

#### jupyter

https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ds-modules-htrc-uncamp-lhu2h60t/tree

jupyter hub with the binder extension makes it easy to use python in classrooms because people don't have to install it locally

walkthrough: https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ds-modules-htrc-uncamp-lhu2h60t/notebooks/01-setup/01-HTRC-Extracted%20Features.ipynb

#### TextThresher

How can HTRC get more researchers using its archives?
Need to let researchers identify and label the corpora, and then query by that structure.
Two approaches:
1. Teach people to write the document parsing scripts
2. Get Humans To Do It (usually waves of undergraduates)
   - humans are much better at event identification, action sequencing, recognizing metaphor, sarcasm or irony

TextThresher lets you work with a different workforce; 10-year jobs can be 1-year jobs

case study: the Deciding Force project, trying to see when and why police and protestors decide to use force
- actions happen inside events, which happen inside campaigns, which happen inside cities, and each layer has impacts, and everything is occuring over time; can't program to identify the interactions

Two-stage content analysis:
1. Instead of having people look through a long article for a hundred variables, they just go through and mark the 5 units of analysis: just mark the parts of the article that are about what protestors are doing, what police are doing, etc
2. Display just the smaller unit of text to someone and ask them more complex questions about its content; if it's about protestor action, ask eg how many protesters are there; and then ask them to highlight the part of the text that justifies their answer
   - (this is also honestly a good way to teach students close readings, 
   
If researchers care about 70 things in relation to each event, the *wrong* way to ask people that is to give them a list of 70 questions for each event. Instead, structure the questions hierarchically so that they only get follow-up questions when they're relevant; on average, people actually only have to answer 9
   
df.goodlylabs.org

Have several people classify the same thing, validate against each other

After you've done a lot of this, you have extremely granular and accurate data that *can* be used for machine learning

#### LC Labs & Collections As Data

The jupyter notebook for Color clusters in images in Library of Congress collections: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LibraryOfCongress/data-exploration/blob/master/Dominant%20colors.ipynb

Documentation increasingly seems crucial for expanding *meaningful* research access -- I'm really digging jupyter as interactive documentation to highlight *use*

Their crowdsourcing approach is 'minimal viable' instructions

### How To Deal With Missing Data

Amanda: interested in this because she's interested in archival absences generally; for right now, it's enough to just say 'hey this is missing' which is an answer in itself.

But archives are just a bunch of stuff: how do you even know if there is supposed to be something there?

Different types of missing: collected but lost, vs never collected

My kind of missing: I have a title but nothing else for one text, and a full text for another -- how do I deal with those holes and not replicate inequalities of attention?

Jonathan: How do we make inferences? If we can't describe the population from which we have a sample, what are we even learning?

Angelica: get a lot of user feedback asking for data or items to be added, but they have no good methods to do that

Jeffrey Young: see a lot of silos; data isn't interoperable; how do you connect those dots? If something is in a silo somwehere, how do you find it? How do you tear down barriers to find

Nathan: 80 various legacy digital projects with little to no metadata, but still serving a very loud bunch of scholars who don't want anything done with them; they're starting a new digital repository on campus and want to bring everything in and standardize. Dublin Core just ot start, with an army of undergraduates -- and then authority control.

Paul Fogel: responsible for generating a lot of content in mass digitization projects; curious about places where they're not filling the needs; also deeply involved in quality efforts: removing data where you think it is, if OCR is terrible the data is not there even though you think it is

Stanislav: have to look somewhere else too to compare HathiTrust; is there a way to contribute it back.

HathiTrust doesn't allow sharing onward of resources, tension with open access
(but open access can be less sustainable, so those resources don't last)

Hathi's balance between being open and being protective/responsible

Hathi gets us so close to the beautiful dream of breaking out of the silos, but that just means it's more frustrating when we hit the walls and can't just tidy up the metadata ourselves when we notice a gaps; it's frustrating to have to send feedback outward
-- but it would cross a major line for HathiTrust to become the canonical metadata source

Hathi's opposite is the Internet Archive: a wild world of not being able to find anything easily, but all kinds of things are there

Have there been crowdsourced project for correcting metadata? -- Wikidata

Sustainability depends on more control, but usability depends on having the data that users need

More and more it's better to use large-scale tools to fix things: and if an individual project collects corrected data for thousands of items, there's nowhere to put it

A lot of cleaning happens in nearly every project before any work is done, but we're duplicating effort; it would be good to be able to feed that back! But then it's so much that it's not reviewable by one person... and again it breaks the model

Are we duplicating as much effort as we feel like we are? Every project is so specific

Some projects actually took advantage of the redundancy! Duplication might not be a problem

The question of authority is still an important one. Publication dates vary across copies -- but who's right and how do you know? The title page of the phycial volume can tell you but 

The best data is chosen, based on scoring

Archive Grid service: tries to identify archives and provide a portal

the scale of texts is mind-boggling --  if you compare it to what exists in physical archives in europe, those items are totally unknoable

Just because it's digitized that doesn't mean anybody can find it; especially digitizing from microfilm... you're putting more noise into your system

social science framework of sample/population: something like google books can't be your sample to study a population of "what people thought"; my approach has been to sort of pre-emptively treat each archive/bibliography as the new population from which I sample

you know there is bias, but you don't know what it is

study of google books found that it's not suitable as a foundation for cultural analytics because it's shaped too strongly by archival failures of various kinds

if we can get some sense of the world of published books -- WorldCat? Alrich Catalogue for journal publications? -- we can compare those against individual archives...

Publication as something that also reinforces gaps: HathiTrust has little emphasis on manuscripts, a very few pamphlets; so maybe it's just not a helpful resource to answer questions about 

Combining multiple sources for analysis: the path forward? Does the data capsule allow this? The technology itself could allow you to bring in URIs from elsewhere -- a good direction?

Or is the thing to signal strongly to researchers to op-out if they are not interested in printed materials from this set of years? Librarians quest for an impossible goal of everything in one place that the librarians have total control over... but there should be different sources for different kinds of work.

HathiTrust's goal is a cultural legacy?

Librarians want perfect complete granular comprehensive universal records -- archivists are just happy if there's a record anywhere at all / the sticky note from a decade ago doesn't fall off the box

Tension between structured data and unstructured data.

Is this about things missing, or about search? Biases built into search engines: what about all that stuff that's on page 40 of your search that might be relevant. Ranking algorithms might have bias... And full-text search is not really full-text search, there's indexing under there. And you're relying on the quality of the OCR.

Search vs query: search great for text, query for other kinds of data

Is Hathi's role just capturing and disseminating, or is there a point where they ever move on to cleaning, or adding value to what you have? (Version control? Actual capture of metadata record?)

The one thing siloing does well is define goals and boundaries of an inquiry or resource. If they only interoperated!

Focus deeper on what HathiTrust does well, make the OCR better? HathiTrust is already pretty wide. Improving OCR also improves the tools

I work in the 18thC where OCR doesn't: improved OCR would fill a lot of gaps in one fell swoop for me at least

OCL enables interoperability in a way you had nothing before; OCR adds another layer of interoperability

#### Conclusions

Many kinds of "missing":
- never collected
- collected but lost
- seems like it's there but it's not (unusable OCR)
- never catalogued, never encoded
- protected by copyright restricted can be "missing"
- collected but held somewhere obscure or unreachable

There's a difference between knowing that you're missing something, and knowing what you're missing

When one scholar discovers something that fills a gap, how can they propagate that back to help others?

As a practical path forward, we seem to turn to combining multiple sources.

### Final Plenary

If researchers have created a dataset and corrected the OCR, how do they make that available? Should HathiTrust come up with some facility to offer multiple OCR versions? HathiTrust does get re-OCR'd material periodically -- for a humanities research who has a dataset, if the dataset just indicates IDs they won't know what version of the OCR they are working on

Advocating for HathiTrust not to depend on Google for OCR: how can HathiTrust work within its resources to improve OCR

### Mastering Metadata workshop

#### HT Metadata availability, coverage, quality

##### Coverage
- bibiographic (descriptive) metadata generated from MARC provided by HT members
    - in case of duplication, Zephir picks 'best' record
    - this means that if there are two copies of the same edition of a work, they both have the same metadata applied from whichever copy was deemed "better"

each bibliographic catalog record is linked to 1 or more volumes / items
- each title (esp in my period) is likely to have many volumes (16 million total volumes; 8.4 total items
)
- catalog records are per title, other metadata is per volume -- watch for this
reading/dissecting a MARC record

##### Completeness
- using records from libraries built up over hundreds of years; completeness will vary WIDELY
- everything has a title, most everything has a publication year, and 99% have OCLC numbers
- only 80% subject headings, only 65% have call numbers
- mostly able to find fiction-only -- but then only 27% of 'fiction' items have subject headings
    - fiction doesn't have genre assignments
    - also as Ted Underwood's "Understanding Genre in a Collection of a Million Volumes" points out, physical volume has multiple genres in it

##### Accuracy and quality
- MARC language codes often don't follow codes for translations, eg "engger" for english translation of german text (won't show up as english)
- Librarians pretty good at author's names, but less good with names that appear in titles and keywords
- Public-domain texts sometimes/often accidentally restricted is source libraries 
- publication dates reflect reprintings rather than first printings; works may be much older than they seem
    - David Bamman "Estimating the Date of First Publication in a Large-Scale Digital Library"
    
www.hathitrust.org/data

##### Ways to get metadata in bulk:
- OAI-PMH harvest: public domain only, MARC or Dublin Core in XML, few hundred at a time openarchives.org
- Bib API call: returns MARC in JSON or JSON & XML; up to 20 at a time; 
- hathifiles file download: returns tab-delimited *selected* metadata; no subjects, for example

OCLC number points to print record of phycial book, also records for the digital edition of that work in HathiTrust

Page-level metadata
- how many pages in the work, how many lines of text, how many tokens, tokens with part-of-speech IDs

HTRC Extracted Feature Solr Search: experimental, combine metadata and page/token search to find volumes and pages of interest

#### Reading/Dissecting a MARC record

"MAchine Readable Cataloguing" : Library of Congress MARC 21 standards www.loc.gov/marc

To view MARC record itself, clip record number from url and add file extension (eg .marc, .json)

MARC record has 0 or 1 of LitF true/false to indicate whether the item is Literary Fiction

##### Publication / Physical info
26x fields: publication (sometimes keyword indexed)
- 260 publication, distribution, etc (imprint) -- for older records
- 264 production, publication, distrivution, manufacture, copyright notice
redundancy: have to check both fields to capture the info; not always repeated or consistent

3xx fields: for physical characteristics (rarely indexed)
- 300 physical description (how many volumes, size, presence of illustration)
- 310/321 publication frequency (for serials)
- 342 geospatial reference data

##### Notes are fields 500-599 (also usually keyword indexed)
general, binding (563), content (505 - for multiple works in one volume), summary (520) - uncommon for old, reproduction, local
- can I find all the volumes with binding info present?
    - HOWEVER the MARC record has been applied to all the catalog items 
    
MARCEdit can help turn MARC forms into more human-friendly forms

##### Identifiers: 0xx fields
- Local System Control Numbers:
    - 001 - HathiTrust record ID; this is what catalog records are
    - 003 - tells us what the 001 is; should all be MiAaHDL (Michican Anne Arbor Hathi Digital Library), other places will have something else... but not all library systems pay attention to 003, so stuff not from HT might be junk or misleading. some systems have OCLC numbers in 001 (because some systems use OCLC for their record numbers); check for this too
- numbers to follow a title through different systems:
    - LoC control number: 010 (41% of records have this)
    - ISBN: 020 (only 27% of records have this)
        - might have book original price attached to the ISBN also, watch for this
        - none of my books will have these
        - HathiTrust in theory has the best ISBN records
    - ISSN: 022 (1%)
    - System Control Nmber (OCLC): 035 (95% - though in theory they should all have them); this is how records get matched
        - to use to match with other library systems or WorldCat
    - 086: government document classification number (65% of gov docs have these; 10% are invalid)
    - 776: OCLC numbers for different formats of the same work
- HathiTrust Item ID: 974
    - describes the particular volume
    - 974r gives rights
    - 974y gives pub date, in theory; it's sort of "best guess"
        - 1999 is a very popular pub date... which just means that it was published some time in the 20thC century, and for rights reasons they assume it was 1999

Very important to treat all identifiers are strings, not numbers; don't let your program throw away leading zeroes!

All of these categories have been defined and redefined over years so it will be messy.

#### Authority Data and Vocabularies

When catalogs went from cards to machine-readable, they typed cards into the MARC record, but cards didn't always contain the same info that was in the MARC record, and also a human had to do this very boring data entry; there will be a lot of absences and misspellings, especially for things catalogued pre-1960
- Have to correct MARC records manually at the level of the individual library originally holding the work; can send corrections to HathiTrust who will pass it on
    - WorldCat is the defacto authority for metadata

##### Authority records
- identify, then differentiate or distinguish, info to support consistency
- HathiTrust uses the authoritative form used by the submitting library

###### Names
- VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) links different countries' authoritative names of authors - viaf.org
 - Authority records often include gender; old German records include occupation

###### Subject and other controlled vocabularies (6xx fields) in MARC
- taken from LoC Subject Headings, LoC Fenre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials; MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)
- Terminology for subject will change over time; updated records will also find things under old terms (since they're connected), but if contributor hasn't updated their vocabulary only the old subject will be attached
- LC authority file: http://authorities.loc.gov
    - consult to see previous headings etc

#### Analysis Tools

Traject: Ruby command line tool for extracting data from MARC records

``` to_field "[field]" extract_marc("[content to match to]")```

MarcEdit: can translate MARC into JSON and XML, including delimited data
- but the headers etc will still be the MARC names, doesn't connect to human-friendly names for the categories
- MarcEdit YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrHRsJ91nVFScJLS91SWR5awtFfpewMWg
- MARC in XML is pretty gross; doesn't take advantage of hierarchy...

OpenRefine
- data cleaning and standardization, reconcile by calling to controlled vocabulaties
- analysis filters and facets, NER
- programminghustorian tutorial, freeyourmetadata.org/reconciliation

#### Subsetting Collections

primary way of subsetting: creating collections
- many collections already exist!
- don't have to be a member to create collections
- collections of about 10 thousand works are where you want to contact HathiTrust to get them built since works have to be added to collections manually
    - even a spreadsheet of HathiTrust numbers doesn't help make a collection, though it *does* help make a workset
    
what's the difference between a collection and a workset?
- collections can include full-view and restricted; worksets must be full-view
- algorithms that run on collections just won't work on restricted volumes, except for rsync (the extracted features algorithm)

#### Making a workset
- Make a collection: do a full text search, then check checkbox for works you want to include
- Download the metadata to get a list of volume IDs
- Upload a list of HathiTrust volume IDs to create an HTRC workset.
    - Files must be in CSV (comma-separated-value) or TXT format. The only required field is HathiTrust ID (for example, hvd.hn5f64) which should be the first column of your data. A collection metadata file downloaded from HathiTrust can be uploaded without any editing.
    
It would be fun to see how much of Tracy and Frank I can find -- I bet it's a decent amount

### To get my stuff:
- for a "dataset" (to play on my laptop)
    - Contact feedback?; likely to talk to Angela; it has to be for research
    - see their page about "datasets" -- sign paperwork to get info
- for a "workset" (to play with HTRC algorithms)
    - I will need a list of volumeIDs
    - to get volumeIDs -- use hathifiles to spot things printed in my period and extract their volumeIDs
        - (the full list of all of hathifiles will be too large to open in excel but I can scrape it basically with grep)
        - (likely to get 2-3% junk results)

they're hoping later this year to make metadata more effectively available, because it's not copyrighted and lots of people want it

### Getting works printed in my decade

#### Original instructions to import selected rows from HathiFiles
1. Download hathi_upd_20171201.txt [for practice; this is what's hard-coded in the grep command right now]
1. Use the single line script in Grep_Sed-PowerShell.txt to select and save rows from sample HathiFile for items published in 1890’s.
    - If using a Mac, you can start Terminal by holding down command + space, typing Terminal and pressing enter. Change into folder containing the HathiFile or adjust paths in script accordingly. Note, copy and paste will lose tab characters, must be reinserted using ctrl-v followed by tab.
1. Import into MS Excel or other spreadsheet application, being careful to import fields as text (not numbers). 
    -You will have best results if you open Excel and use the Data Menu to import from Text File.  Remember to change each field being imported from General to Text or Date as appropriate for the values
1. For column names, see: https://www.hathitrust.org/hathifiles_description
1. Try reordering (for example) by Publication year (column Q) or HathiTrust Record Number (column D) which will collate serial volumes. HathiTrust Record numbers can be used to link to catalog records and Bib API in HathiTrust.

#### My version of the grep command:

```grep "	179[[:digit:]]	" hathi_full_20180101.txt | sed -E "s/	/\"	\"/g" | sed -E "s/^/\"/" | sed -E "s/$/\"/" > VolsPublishedIn1790s.tsv

grep "	1789	" hathi_full_20180101.txt | sed -E "s/	/\"	\"/g" | sed -E "s/^/\"/" | sed -E "s/$/\"/" > VolsPublishedIn1789.tsv```

manually add 4 tabs in command line so it will run right -- tap ctrl-V then tab to insert (use 'show invisibles' to see where tabs need to go in the above)

update the txt file to match whatever I'm running it on

in the output, I have to add "htitem_id" as the title of the first column and delete the other columns


### Problems I am noticing:
- Because of the way they 'unify' MARC records, each invididual volume of a multi-volume novel is usually labelled as just being that novel; novels are often missing a volume somewhere; this makes 18thC records particularly inaccurate
- The collection-building process seems to expect us to work on groups of texts so small that even I would consider Just Reading Them as an appropriate alternative

<!-- As predicted the solution to “I can’t figure out how to do anything at all with this resource” is “show up in person and people will share the private google docs containing instructions and bits of custom code” -->

### Keynote

#### "Increasing our Vision for 21st-Century Digital Libraries"
Elizabeth Lorang and Leen-Kiat Soh, U Nebraska-Lincoln
projectaida.org

Library of Congress's American Memory digital collection in 1998 was the first online digital collection -- departed from previous practice by allowing access to full texts. Browse collections by time, place, and later topic, rather than by item -- a "main door". This remains the foregrounded entry point now, 20 years later; much-expanded content options, but no change in *ways* of accessing information. Same in most large-scale digital libraries.

"More product, less process": a framework to address backlog of archival materials; prioritize getting collections accessible rather than dealing with them in rich detail. "establishes an acceptable minimum level of work" sufficient to encourage use (which then becomes the norm)

For digital libraries, MPLP means: digital image; basic bibliographic metadata; for printed material only, basic OCR; text-based searching of metadata and OCR'd text, browsing interface via metadata

What does it really mean to process digital materials to an extent that they are findable and usable for researchers? Are they truly accessible?

Some libraries now allow access via APIs and bulk downloads; a significant development for certain kinds of research and use

"Main doors" introduce visitors to the collections and highlight particular kinds of use / access

Not enough for the materials to exist -- users must be able to find them
The current processing and access benchmarks are simply not adequate by these factors

The "workset model" of HathiTrust is an attempt at another model

Power of interfaces as normative to structure even the kinds of questions

What has been the impact of 20 years of keyword searches for users' ideas of what's of value in collections?

Common use of keyword search is taken as evidence of the need for keyword search, but of course people use keyword search when it is the default and often only way to interact with materials

##### Images analysis as basis for exploring textual materials

(Would be cool to see something that automatically resized images based on the dimensions of the work)

Visual cues are generaly noticable in fascimiles but users can't do more than observe them

Resources invested in making some collectons more detailed or more usable will reinforce their use -- thus raising the possibility of only more firmly reinscribing the biases and canons that literary and cultural studies have been working to explode

Work with historic newspapers: highly challenging; highly heterogeneous (= highly rewarding)

keyword search assumes that researchers want to find names or dates, but the ability to find particular kinds of content is no better than pre-digital... can we find poems?

(This is exactly what I wanted to do with poems and epigraphs in 18thC novels!)

Inspired by the cognitive power of human vision in abstracting what we see and learning to recognize patters

their paper: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july15/lorang/07lorang.html

This is exciting enough that all I can think about it kidnapping it to find poetry in the 1790s and doing my whole dissertation on that -- or poetry in a longer stretch of time? 1750-1820?

The promise is that it will also work in languages other than English, further extending the promise of studying outside of pre-defined silos

#### Lightning talks

##### David Bamman "The impact of OCR quality on natural language processing"

choice of training texts is always crucial, changing domains trickier than it seems: @dbammam describing how NLP trained on news is bad as identifying subjects that come after their verbs

do we just get garbage, if we add OCR errors on top of that?

use Gutenberg and manual identification to build a body of accurate part of speech tagging: compare this true transcription with a bunch of OCR transcriptions from HathiTrust

HathiTrust has 400 copies of Robinson Crusoe -- align those to the Gutenberg and compare to evaluate the OCR accuracy, and compare that to POS

Linear relationship between quality -- as OCR gets worse, POS gets worse (and syntax trees get worse) but gradually rather than with a horrible cliff

##### U Iowa writers workshop

Impressive change in gender balance over time -- strikingly male-dominated for a time but now balanced

Text data collection: Style Card, LitMap (location references)

Wanted to work at scale with contemporary literature, which is in copyright -- data capsule to the rescue

What was the data-cleaning process that brought them from 2500 vols 280 authors -> 1500 vols 270 authors

Looking at locations in their writing is a cool way to combine biographical data and literary data

(Want to make data explorable so people can find new research questions..... I approve strongly of the avoidance of a black box, but are there times where the creation of tools/manipulable datasets dodges the work of providing analysis/interpretation/conclusions ?)

##### "Evaluating the Chicago School: Why Supervised Algorithms?" - Dan Costa Baclu

Interesting that one must not justify using supervision; unsupervised neural networks now becoming the norm

## January 23

‘Hard times produce extraordinary people. I don’t know what the practical application of that thought could be.’ - Doris Lessing’s autobiography

This seems to be the central problem of A Simple Story. And perhaps of the whole novel of suffering in the first place?

##### Laura Nelson, Northeastern U: "Collections as Data"

(what is her first chart? it's talkin about my stuff!)

Comarative Histrical Social Science: what were the political identities that led to the French Revolution, class or neighbourhood? (Stephen Gould) -- extremely specific questions about time periods, people, etc

social sciences have very specific theories of sampling and generalizability; not comfortable using eg google books without very detailed info on data-generating process
- focus on specific authors, organizations, and publications
- missing metadata can be a dealbreaker; missing data can be a dealbreaker
- focus is not on 'high culture'; interested in periodicals, not novels -- often not a high priorities for libraries, and missing data can *really* be a dealbreaker

###### Example: women's movements
Is there an isomorphism between ideas and social structures? (Ideas of individuals and groups have to match to social structure or the culture is unstable)

Did it the hard way with hand-digitized materials 1860-1975, found a difference in NYC vs Chicago
- NYC change happens through individuals, generalizing experiences of individual women and abstracting to theories of social structures
   - more decentralized social structure (lower graph centrality score)
- Chicago change happens through insititutions making concrete changes to policies
   - spoke-and-wheel social structure (higher graph centrality score)

The 'who cares': which structures lead to lasting social change? how do we translate ideas into practice?

(she is using jupyter)

It's reassuring to see someone taking missing data taken so seriously, rather than kind of hand-waving it.

##### Scalable Detection of Text Reuse

Original approach: partitioning docs into windows, partitioning windows into ngrams - all in RAM, which is a terrible idea!

Intertext makes it happen at scale!
(intended to be like commonplacecultures but more user-friendly)

3grams in a sliding window; take minhashes of the window

github.com/yaledhlab/intertext -- it looks like this is working well enough that I could use it to answer my questions about 18thC Shakespeare!

##### Lightning talks

Pine Mountain Appalachian archives are telling a story about the natural world, local practices -- and leaving out coal. Something important here about the role of the researcher as expert who can spot absences? (esp connected to Laura Nelson's observations on missing data as a dealbreaker)

abbyy finereader: OCR software

(Don't ask me to compare the red parts of two graphs when red means something different in each graph! D: )

(I only grow more and more confident in my convictions re: what topic modelling can and cannot identify.)

Library of Congress crowdsourcing to find images & their captions is cool, though as always I want to know what "the crowd" gets out of helping... something that let users find out more about the images in some fashion might make it informative/enjoyable. (Also I'm not sure if it's working, if my squares disappear after I click "done"? Some kind of feedback showing that I did it right would help!)

## January 21, 2018

I told all my writing students that you know you're on the track of a good topic when you have too many ideas -- so I am in better shape than I feel. It does feel like a step forward to have identified several concrete, specific questions that are nonetheless dissertation-sized, even if some of them are are a bit orthoganal to the questions I thought I was interested in.

For the record, my current list of potential questions is as follows:

1. What older works were reprinted strategically during the 1790s to respond to a new context? ( / How did the timeliness of their printing affect how they were read?)
    * How precisely can I recapture a historical moment? (timeline of the revolution correlated with weather, price of bread, etc)
    * the impact of caffeine
1. What general strategies did writers use, to respond to the turmoil of their political situation? Do these strategies correlate with demographic or political categories? Do different strategies dominate at different times?
    * I increasingly think that the anxieties-writ-large of Gothic novels really did increase emotional turmoil like their stodgy critics claimed. Does that make them "bad"?
    * I would love to spend some time on strategies of reading 'against the grain', particularly those which can give solace in times of fear. 
    * How does one "suffer like a heroine"? Does it help?
    * Benevolence / sentiment will also probably emerge here as strategies
1. How much DO we know about the chapbook/pamphlet trade? How did people write, print, sell, buy, and read them? What's the difference between a chapbook and a pamphlet, anyway? What was written down from which we can reconstruct their history?
    * How fast was the cycle of responses between pamphlets?
1. How do our current 18thC corpora (mis)represent the works printed in the 1790s? If we work only with the easiest-to-access corpora, what do we leave out?
    * Can I make a reverse recommendation engine, to combat our assumptions of homophily?
    * Most literary works aren't a single stable object at all
    * What would decanonization look like?
    * systematic meta-analysis of The Literature (and especially what it says about various forms of literary production), in spreadsheet form of course
1. Does "genre fiction" operate differently from "other" fiction? Are the 1790s the origin of "genre fiction"?
    * What history can I write of science fiction and apocalyptic fiction if I look only at the 18thC? Can I make direct comparisons to the present day?
        * Check out depictions of future London as a ruin
    * More and WW both use "genre" fiction for their non-"genre" works?
    * How to see and make sense of generic hybridity? (Gothic as cross-generic mode)
1. Does literary celebrity inhibit the formation of a lasting legacy? Or only for women?
    * How do individual authors cultivate fame during my decade? Who is most successful? How does that correspond with later fame?
    * The Romantics are like the Della Cruscans, except we remember them
1. I could trace the development of a single idea / theme in the decade:
    * convents! you can store your women in them, but what's going to happen in there?
    * the invention of "debt" as a concept, and a sin (compared to credit)
1. Who is reading what in Britain? 

Am I trying to make a theory of literary history? "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (Moretti Distant Reading 145) Possible theories in the above:
* old texts are reprinted to fit current needs (legacy is happenstance)
* genre fiction something something?
* too much literary celebrity inhibits legacy

------

"Who read what, and how?" is essentially a meta-question -- it's not specific enough to make a dissertation (there's no way for me to start answering it), but will play a role in whatever I choose.

I also really want to know "What works have reparative readings available that nourished in the 1790s and/or can nourish now?" -- (how) can that be my question? Or is that also just going to be underneath everything I do?

![spreadsheet comparing my research Qs](/figures/artisanal-spreadsheets/research-Qs.png)

I think I'd be interested in pursuing any of those top three questions...

## January 14, 2018

I think I'm finally recovering from the 'blow' of special fieds... it at least feels **possible** to turn my hopes, interests, and tools into coherent and meaningful questions.

## January 11, 2018

At MLA I felt slightly baffled by the Romanticism papers, and so delighted and excited by the theory and DH ones -- I think I can't possibly be a Romanticist.

I might still be an 18thC scholar, but I gave Romanticism the good old college try, and it's just not where my heart lies.

I don't think I've been in a good emotional place to work; I don't feel like I know what I'm trying to do, or how what I am doing is important or relevant to others. (I don't know how to leave my queerness etc at home, OR how to bring it into my work. 

## December 14, 2017

I passed fields!!

I've been trying so hard to position my project as 18thC first, DH incidentally, but I wonder if that is misguided. 

## December 7, 2017

I keep wanting to get more ridiculously exhaustive, just to see if I *can*.

Could I reconstruct a month? Track down, e.g., weather, exactly what was published each day, letters and diaries from as many people as possible — how much information can I get on the happenings of a single day?

## November 30, 2017

Finished OGS application -- time for special fields!!!!

## November 27, 2017

Hypotheses to test in shakespeare project:
- Stiller et al day that plays have an upper limit in size because of an inherent limit in human social groupings; plays become incoherent if they present more people/groups than humans are accustomed to tracking the detailed relationships of. But what if this is a metric distinguishing tragedies and comedies, and tragedies present fracturing social worlds where comedies present clear and connected/clustered worlds?
- in-degree/out-degree disparity as a marker for social rank?

## November 17, 2017

Meeting with Dr Lopez:
- some ideas about using it as a pedagogical tool, especially if we can visually encode unreliability of source texts, have it give more useful "feedback", put charts next to each other at same scale, include substantial editorial apparatus
- but honestly, I don't want to get into the world of pedagogical shakespeare tools. I think our time would be better spent moving on to 18thC texts
- does mom want to try to collaborate with the personas tool people??
- I think we could publish some basic genre things in a CS or *maybe* DH journal, but not a literary one. So, I don't want to spend TOO long on that, and instead go forward with 18thC tragedies

## November 15, 2017

question for mom: are you at all interested in a database unification project..? I’m trying to figure out how to combine multiple archives and it occurs to me that something ProFusion-y might be interesting... the main difficulty comes from the fact that many interesting databases are ‘closed’ and require institutional access; but would it be possible to have someone log in via their institution and search one database that correlates 

## November 14, 2017

Reviewing notes from meeting with Tom & Terry to make a report to Alex; some ideas that seem particularly fruitful right now:
* Gothic as cross-generic mode
* The decade's attention to timeliness requires a particular generic reciprocity and reponsiveness from all works
    * the idea of a work as a singular unified "object" is created by modern editing

## November 11, 2017

####Explaining fields to Olli:

passing the exam means proving that I am ready to write my first chapter

and to write a chapter that I know will actually fit inside of the dissertation as a while, I now need to have about a 50% understanding of what the hell my dissertation is ABOUT

Lawrence: like: are all my chapters going to be “compare two authors and how they use one genre”? (I…. think so???)

Lawrence: are my other chapters “Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, and the gothic novel” and “Mary Robinson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the periodical poem”?

Lawrence: if so, is three chapters enough?? cuz I only have three chapters worth of ideas in that format

Lawrence: and/or do I think I’ll come up with other ideas in that format?

Lawrence: or are my chapters more different from each other? like, maybe I write about More & Wordsworth, and all the ballad stuff goes into a different chapter that’s just about “okay but most of what people were reading was fun stuff like songs and ghost stories”

Lawrence: and that’s the one where I talk about my emerging theory of timeliness

Lawrence: or is timeliness not a chapter, but in fact the overarching theme of the whole diss?

Lawrence: who knows!!! hopefully me, in a month!

## November 8, 2017

Meeting with mom about Shakespeare!

Updates on progress:
- I sent mom some abstracts
-- progressive structuration - similar questions as me about how to look at plot at a large scale, but a 
-- Hewitt's paper - he did basically the same thing we did technically speaking, but then extracted just one mathematical feature (Eigenvector centrality) and saw a long-term historical trend in that figure
--- we can be different by looking at more/different figures, and seeing what correlated with genres; we're interested 
-- Personae - a pretty (but uninteresting too), only two plays, and yet sufficient for presentation at ADH
--- what we're doing better is looking at genre, wider variety of statistics available, more plays, more useful tool

- Word Vectors: mom did this in 1999! we should do something with this, for 2019...?
-- topic models are just dimensionality and math, nothing remotely semantic to them; word vectors get more semantically involved because they pay attention to word contexts
--- runs on individual words; for every individual word see what words occur around it, coming up with a vector, 
---- what is the usage of "Gothic"? ***
-- began as a technique to automatically build thesaurae (which could then be used to expand querys for search!) -- but published it as a query expansion technique, not as a text analysis technique


Project status:
- quotations: going more slowly; mom met with her and she should be done with GREs this week and resuming research again
- networks: almost had all the data etc today! but it will be Friday
- comparing plays to movie scripts, waiting on Manisha

Potential future development: if networks are indeed useful for genre, train a neural network on them and see if it can identify genre
- compare English, French, and Asian plays from different time periods

## November 1, 2017

Reading Rita Felski -- I am energized by a desire to recuperate the emotional *use* to which the Gothic can be put as an outlet and coping mechanism for suffering, for social subjection, for lack of futurity

## October 31, 2017

Met with Tom today -- Fields has to do with demonstrating capability for teaching undergrads, familiarity with field without getting bogged down in criticism

#### Notes from my journal:

I think these are the general areas in which I hope to write. what sort of questions interest you in these general areas?
1. generic mixing
2. publication history (timeliness) <- narrators, France
3. “information / truth management” <- supernatural (empiricist epistemology)
4. benevolence, sentiment
5. historic memory / futurity? <- discontinuity (apocalypse)
6. commerce & credit

position in relation to scholarship w/o losing text <-- position paper

show broader context for diss *texts* + can situate them among landmarks
* --> engagement w/ *primary* texts + show reading / teaching (keep secondary secondary)

1. less into drama, less in the Romantic curriculum.
    * Gothic as cross-generic mode: interesting, not well-written
2. Beckford - Gothic novels influencing each other out of publication sequence <-- Northanger has
    * Byron poetical Tristram Shandy
3. J Paul Hunter *Before Novels* "continuation _____s" Shandy etc endings
4. novel vs lyric poem vulnerability to parody
    * Hannah More "sensibility" * [for engagement with the danger that sentimental engagement prevents rather than enables direct intervention for good]
        * <-- conservative evangelical attacks on sensibility as well as radicals
        * (More wants to abolition grounded in Christian duty, not "mere" feeling)
5. psychological authors' relation to watershed moments / historic breaks
6. Hume: "On Commerce" / "On Luxury" * "commerce, luxury, money, + interest"

how many Qs help w/ drama?

## October 26, 2017

Talked with Terry today -- *timeliness* is emerging as a crucial concept for me.

#### Notes from my journal:

Things that interest me:
* Ghost stories (Wordsworth vs More, as per Gamer)
* Benevolence
* Economics
* Surprisingly, not works of direct political philosophy? (They're so... theatrica? I find their emotional narratives more palatable in fiction) -- Frustrated by disconnect between content and rhetoric
* Timeliness as a literary trait -- many seemingly unified works are actually not (Shandy, CSmith, WW + LB)

W's preface why poetry vs *theatre*

Jeff Cox edition of Keats - chronological
--> I should look for scholarship *

Shandy + Otranto * Timeliness --> DH meetings,

When do people write about Marie Antoinette in prison? does she get mentally imprisoned before reality? <-- a lot on Marie, need to find something *really surprising* to be worth it

generic reciprocity

what occurs *between* volumes / editions that makes one work need to be responsive?

**The decade's attention to timeliness requires a particular generic reciprocity** * *
* (More interesting than tracing literal direct discussion of French Revolution)

Dany O'Quinn - performance negotiating aftermath of American War

my frustration with treatises -> a result of time pressure ---- pressure produces affective quality?
* --> but Godwin *does* pause to reflect etc and then I get bored and want a novel

pamphlet vs tome *physically* ephemeral/timely

Mary Robinson's "snowdrop" poem from novel <-- like CSmith + Radcliffe

( -->)mediation + remediation (<-- like citation)
* --> Terry will find scholars

editions are "theme + variatins" not unified, singular

## October 25, 2017

Notes from meeting with mom:

meeting with mom

- I will go through the DH2018 application beforehand

AGENDA ITEMS
- ask mom what has been done so far

-- Manisha Shulka (MA student) is in charge of the projects, she is doing her masters thesis in this area

-- the French students have gone; they were working on two distinct projects:
--- we have downloaded and parsed all of the Shakespeare, and built social networks on all of them (Pierre and Manuel, and before than Preston)
--- Manisha is in charge of putting that on the web
--- get these exposed and really happy, fix interface issues, etc, and THEN maybe the 500 Early Modern Plays
--- something went wrong with the play... it’s showing definitely wrong numbers for Much Ado but works for Hamlet

-- another student (senior undergrad honors) wants to compare play and movie scripts and how their social networks compare; he is looking at non-shakespeare based just on what he can find scripts of for free (I am interested in all movie adaptations of Hamlet) - but this will be a while

-- freshman honors student is also interested in something here, TB

-- also the quotation project with Marion, looking for all the shakespeare in Northanger Abbey; mom needs to meet with her, is following up now
--- she is having difficulty developing for non-exact matches, ngram matches
--- she has all the ECCO texts parsed; she extracted just the raw text so we can look for any quote in any book

-- Marion is going to combine the best parts of everybody’s parsing code and put it up on the server
-- also going to find all those “details” of numbers paper


- if I want to mess with this:
-- log in as mom with the info given previously, find probably /projects/clip/sna and then the online thing is in javascript package d3; the counting code was in java, then went into gephi to analyse the graph
-- I could copy all of it, play away and make it look nicer, and then merge it back in later

- literary implications: 
-- looking at tragedy, comedy, history
-- do ensembles change over time? interest in large groups or just one protagonist?
-- what plays are most similar, what plays most different?
-- can we detect subplots via clusters? - what’s the mathematical value of cliquishness? gephi has this

- ask what I should say in meeting with Jeremy
-- infodump that we’re working on, demo Hamlet (but don’t leave him with the URL) -- ask him for his immediate thoughts, thumbs-up/down on current lines of thought, what questions dome to mind that you’d like answer to -- and we’ll scurry away
--- who else should we compare to?

** I will send mom that DH2018 paper on social networks

- schedule next meeting

Next steps:
- once the code is working, mom will send Manisha to let me play with aesthetics in a sandbox; once it looks nicer, we’ll move it into the main area
- I will get the CLiP website sorted in the mean time
- I will have an initial meeting with Jeremy
- I will send DH2017 article about networks
- DH2018: the tool (live demo) is available for you to use! email us interesting question you have! we are excited to collaborate with you on new features!
-- plan for us to both go, but negotiate with Emma

** figure christmas plans

## October 24, 2017

The idea of an author doesn't hold water: not just Dorothy Wordsworth is part of William Wordsworth's poems, but also Jane Austen's family is part of her novels; it's inaccurate to imagine them as self-contained founts of genius, all writing is collaboration with someone

The conclusion I draw from that is 20% "so let's make sure we research things like the family joke in Northanger about the name Richard"

And 80%: All *reading* is a collaboration! So when you read something, especially when you're a wee student and you're handed some monument of Literature to read, that's not actually a one-way full of Great Knowledge from the Great Author to you, that's a process that you have a share in, and you probably want to put some work in to make yourself a *good* reader (see: my struggles with sci fi and noir), but you also have the power to choose a mode of reading that works for you, that gives you things you want out of the literature (reparative reading!)

## October 20, 2017

CSECS is SO INSPIRING -- I want to really deeply dig into some research!! I want to know new things that other people might want to hear about!!! I've avoide conferences because writing papers about completed works wasn't helping me get closer to publication -- but now I think I need to do another round of them to inspire me to generate to ideas and research new work. I haven't DONE RESEARCH in ages, and I miss it!

## October 16, 2017

Talked with Alex about some of the research rabbit holes I've been going down--
* glow-worms: a rabbit hole, albeit interesting one
* something about Austen and the negative impact of literary celebrity on legacy: check: go down that rabbit hole
* lessons from the French revolution: does not sound like a rabbit hole so much as  - you learning the broader stuff for your field
* timeline of the French revolution keyed to temperature: also not a rabbit hole, but a cool sideline instead! but after some articles are to readers
* Wordsworth and More: certainly not a rabbit hole, or sideline -  this sounds like core business


Notes for meeting with Gillespie:

items accomplished from last time:
- scheduled fields exam!
- finished a readable draft of MA essay journal article and sent it for feedback

items still in progress from last time:
- OGS: reviewed requirements, currently drafting Plan of Study
- meetings with Tom & Terry re: fields questions: I will reach out schedule these today
- MLA paper: next step was to pick a gamey journal to publish in, I have a shortlist and am narrowing it down
- think about research questions for my diss that *I* really want to know the answers to:
-- I am going down a lot of little, odd rabbit holes! (like glowworms)
-- I am thinking about Jane Austen, and wondering whether my chronological focus is cutting me off from something interesting... why Austen and not Radcliffe? What would the literary canon look like with Radcliffe as our central figure? (I re-read Udolpho and it’s GOOD)

items Alex was going to do:
- look into ways for me to be involved with DHN
- sound out Holger re: Shakespeare collaboration

things to talk about today:
- MA essay journal article?
- diss research questions?

## October 1, 2017

Stray notes found while tidying my desktop:

#### Gothic notes.txt

gothic as survival strategy for vulnerable women

the gothic of A Little Princess

the meaning of suffering


if I want to topic model Gothic and Not Gothic, my Not Gothic needs to be some astonishingly boring non-fiction treatise in order to ensure that it is actually not gothic

## September 30, 2017

Lesson learned from editing my journal article: I'd gotten carried away starting a new paper entirely at the end; when I felt like I needed "more" in order to conclude, even though I'd hit the word count, that was the next idea getting started. **Be on the look-out for a new paper starting, as the sign that the previous paper has finally finished.** (Just like starting to revise/write my second draft means that the first draft has previously finished!)

## September 20, 2017

One of the lessons we should probably learn from the French Revolution is that ideological purity is not only unecesseary, it is impossible.

## September 19, 2017

Okay, but really, what **if** the Norton Anthology presented all the works in chronological order, instead of grouping them by author? You could include author bios at at author's first appearance, but the whole system of biographical readings would break down.. instead, there would have to be running historical contextualization. It would make current ways of teaching inconvenient, but perhaps in productive ways: if you wanted to read a bunch of poems by one author, students would have to skip past the other writing that was produced in between, a tangible reminder of the time that actually did separate those works. It also makes it easier to sub in less "important" authors, when you're looking for a work to fill just one chronological slice rather, than an author whose ouevre will be broadly applicable.

---

I want to do something like **Shakespeare and the Idea of Apocrypha: Negotiating the Boundaries of the Dramatic Canon**, by Peter Kirwan ... does that mean I am going to have to much about with Wordsworth and Coleridge and the Romantics? (At that point am I just replicating Michael Gamer's work?)

Part of what frustrates me is that these important, fascinating novels **aren't** in any kind of canon, that the canon just skips from Richardson to Austen, despite the fact that Austen is a wild aberration.

Oh no... am I going to have to write against **Austen**?? But I adore her!

(also, how hilariously nearsighted that I can't think of anybody canonical from my period, hahaha, when Austen is one of the few names able to tangle with Shakespeare.)

## September 9, 2017

I think it is the reparative impulse that is making my special fields reading so poweful -- I just read Shelley's Ode to the West Wind, and it was beautiful, in a way it never had been before, just as Wordsworth and Coleridge have been beautiful, and even Blake was bearable for the very first time. All my previous attempts have been from the position of needing to dissect and master these giants whose importance would determine my own; my hurried and impersonal readings couldn't find the value in them. But now that I read them looking for pleasure and for interest, and looking also for how the poets themselves were engaged with their worlds and looking for their own pleasure and interest -- now the rotten wet leaves of autumn are powerful to me, and I too want to hope, that oh, if winter comes, spring must follow.

## September 8, 2017

A bunch of thoughts from tumblr: 

I have been reading for special fields and just... just falling in love
right now I am catching up on the responses to fizzygin's post on fandom and it's connecting to the Eve Sedgwick I've been reading

hbbo
ooooh hooray!!

me
I've been stumbling around for a while in the idea of "reparative reading" as an alternative to the typical reading-symptoms-to-expose-the-hidden-patriarchal-(or-whatever)-systems-lurking-underneath "paranoid reading" of literary texts

hbbo
intriguing, say more

me
this framework is something Sedgwick articulated such that it suddenly crystallized all my thoughts
let me see if I can express it!

me
I suspect it mostly feels like a powerful distinction to someone who has slogged through a hundred mediocre attempts to recreate Foucault, Lacan, Freud, etc, by saying "Pride and Prejudice APPEARS to be a charming love story, but I, the CRITIC, have SEEN ITS SECRETS, and I expose to you now the horrible systems upon which its world rests!"
which falls flat for me partly because, sure, yeah, I am aware of capitalism, it does not surprise me that there is capitalism in P&P. Austen was also aware of capitalism.

hbbo
ha, yes

me
Some of these are more successful than others -- some texts really are relying upon but not willing to examine some lurking system or another
decolonial readings are often more successful for me on that front, because the authors (especially in the 19thC) really are trying to avoid addressing their own complicity

hbbo
right
achebe on heart of darkness, etc.

me
and Sedgwick.. hm, she certainly doesn't argue that one must never interrogate or dissect a text
but she writes out of a frustrated boredom with this approach, and the feeling that, despite the rhetorical flourishes and triumph of the conquering critic, we often don't learn anything new or useful from this process
especially if we're all accustomed now to just assume that *everything* has terrible underlying frameworks

hbbo
/me nods

me
so there are two quotes I have pasted at the top of my dissertation notes doc:

me
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."

hbbo
hmmmm yes, interesting

me
Which is -- a totally different way of responding to the flaws and insufficiencies of a text, and one that has intense appeal to me

hbbo
reminds me of several chapters of that lesbian history by emma donoghue I was reading a month or so ago

me
oh! tell me more!

hbbo
she talks a lot about how, like

hbbo
the fact that a text that represents or misrepresents woman-woman desire, in a lot of ways, fundamentally hostile to that desire or AT THE VERY LEAST extremely ill-informed about it, doesn't mean that historical same-sex-attracted women didn't gain value from those texts, even if that value required different kinds of readings than intended

me
ohhh, yeah!
yeah, that's a perfect example, I think

me
I've just added a bunch of donoghue to y t-read list; that one was Passions Between Women, yeah?

hbbo
reading that book was pretty much a continual exercise in punching the air for me, ahahaha
yes, that's the one

me
that example appeals to me also because it gestures toward a reason for all of this discussion of non-paranoid reading to be called "queer theory", which initially seemed strange to me

hbbo
yes!

me
surely everyone can see that this is an often necessary reading practice, and an important part of literature's role in our lives
the wilful remaking of a text into something that works for you

hbbo
that is definitely the political context in which I've thought most about that general idea
yes

me
my own work is interested in the uses that 18thC basically-heterosexual women make of semi-misogynist literature

hbbo
/me nods!

me
(by basically heterosexual, I mean women who want to end up in happy companionate marriages with men)

hbbo
right

me
I think I've talked to you about this also? the escapist fantasy, in a novel where women are powerless to do anything but cry when kidnapped, is that the crying will work

hbbo
oh, huh--I don't think we have had this conversation, but that makes a lot of sense

me
I've been thinking, also, about the virtues of the Gothic as a narrative mode which doesn't truck with any bullshit about women's place in the world. Powerful men are tyrants who can destroy you! Your feelings are correct on that front! You are excruciatingly vulnerable!
And now here is a story where everything turns out okay anyway.

hbbo
yes. a space in which to really lug out all those repressed anxieties and blow them up as big as they're able to go
can be very cathartic for sure
and not only cathartic but useful

me
yeah, yeah
The contemporary narrative of an "empowering" story for women is about women having power, and indeed a lot of criticism looks at these works to try to find the particular womanly kinds or spheres of power that make the texts "subversive" or "progressive"... and I do see some of that, there is a compelling thread of women having access to emotional manipulation of men as an effective strategy that makes men look foolish and less powerful

hbbo
/me nods

me
but I think for the most part they're not trying to say, "you have the incredible power of emotional manipulation!" -- I really think they're wallowing in the abjectness of acknowledging powerlessness
and, this is the part that has been firing up my soul, the thing you can do, when you have no power, is you can refuse to endorse your oppressor's actions

hbbo
/me nods

me
this is a bit of a fantasy too, really, but it's one that speaks to me -- the idea that as long as you make them FORCE you, as long as you don't capitulate, that's -- it's not POWER, but.....
*hands in the air* this is where I don't know what I'm saying yet

hbbo
no, yeah, it's at the very least a sort of
sovereignty over the self

me
ooooooh, yeah
sovereignty is a good term for it

me
hmm, I'm thinking now that there's also a sort of exposure of tyranny, too. If you refuse to walk with your kidnapper and force him to carry you, you deprive him of some of his illusions

hbbo
right
I feel like this comes up a lot in like
idk, narratives of long captivity, I'm trying to think of examples

me
oh, yeah, there would be a connection there

hbbo
like in 1984, he talks a lot under torture but it's not until he voluntarily betrays his lover that his selfhood is really broken

me
ohhhh, yeah
man, I read that novel like a decade too young to get anything out of it, I should revisit it

hbbo
I mean, DEBATABLE how voluntary that really is if your alternative is getting your face eaten off by rats, but
still

me
well, the 18thC heroine ideal is to literally die before, say, signing paperwork allowing someone to take her ancestral property

hbbo
yeah I read it ages ago as well
ahahahahaha yes

me
but that feels like part of the fantasy, this idea that you actually will just get your face eaten off by rats before you betray your own self
even if in all other interactions you are timid and delicate
1984 of course not being interested in fantasy

hbbo
I think there's certainly a fantasy at play in basically all fictional depictions of torture, face-rats or no, that if a person is really truly morally strong and really believes in themselves & their cause, they will stand up to whatever gets thrown at them

me
that rings true

me
hah, now honestly A Little Princess is coming to mind
but all those victorian ideals of noble suffering
before you said that, I was thinking of A Handmaid's Tale

hbbo
in a way it's a sort of---ahahahaha I never really thought about this parallel, but it's a sort of cultural fantasy of platonic maleness in the same way that 18th century novels gave us a platonic ideal of the sensible (in the sense of exquisitely sensitive) female

me
expand on that!
the platonic ideal of maleness is that pure resistance to torture? 1984 is about this platonic ideal?

hbbo
a real man should stand up to waterboarding or he loses his Real Maleness, in the same way that an 18th century girl should turn instinctively away from indelicate subject matter, even if she has been sheltered from knowing what that indelicacy consists in
well 1984 is... a relevant but maybe not spot-on example

me
oh, that IS interesting, especially since the 18thC value of Real Maleness, I think, actually consists more in never allowing an insult to stand, always responding to defend oneself! And the endurance of suffering is a female cirtue
That level of toughness in the face of torture is certainly a more male ideal nowadays though

hbbo
yeah I'm thinking of, ugh
I feel like there was a debate on this subject around the show "24," though I never watched it

hbbo
where torture was being depicted as this valid tool for extracting useful information from tough men who just needed to be worn down before they would decide to crack
the counter-argument from people who have actually observed how torture works being: when pain gets to a certain point basically everyone will start making up stories they think their torturer wants to hear, in order to make it stop

me
ohhh, interesting
yeah, I recall that conversation

hbbo
so it's both a shitty construction of manhood, and a shitty interrogation technique

me
the broad cultural one, I mean

hbbo
yes

me
ahahaha, I mean: men.

hbbo
LOL ikr

me
if my studies have taught me anything, they've taught me that men have been EXHAUSTING for at least 250 years. in the 18thC it was a woman's responsibility to emotionally manipulate men out of duelling over her; if they duelled and someone died, it was her fault

me
poor Clarissa gets the silent treatment from her whole family because her brother and a guy she hates who tried to assault her got into a duel, and both of them even lived but it was very awkward that now Mr. Assault had to be struck from all their guest lists, and why didn't Clarissa manage the whole thing better??

hbbo
wow
good grief

me
so that's the 1740s, written by a man -- by the 1790s I can see the appeal of novels by women saying "MEN ARE EXHAUSTING AND ACTIVELY TRYING TO FUCK UP YOUR LIFE"

hbbo
ahahahahahaha yes
IT'S TRUE, GIRLS
IT'S ALL TRUE
no rumor too wild

me
that novel is also the progenitor of the woman-grabbed-into-carriage-for-forced-elopement trope, as far as I can tell
uh, are you worried about spoilers for Clarissa?

hbbo
ahahahahaha no
I am not

me
well, he says he will kill himself if she doesn't talk to him in the garden, so she goes to the garden to talk to him
he yanks her into a carriage to drive away to scotland where they can elope
I haven't read this far myself, but evidently along the way he rapes her, and she eventually dies
and then for my fields list every novel by a woman has had a scene where a woman gets grabbed into a carriage against her will for an elopement
I actually asked one of my fellow 18thC scholars if this was a common trope or if I was imagining it, and she laughed and agreed that it's everywhere
but in all the ones I read, what the women do, in the carriage, is they cry, energetically, refusing food or water or sleep

me
for days
until they are on the brink of death

me
and then their attempted kidnapper has to call a doctor, and the doctor says, "you are going to kill this woman if you force her to marry you, do you love her or not??" and the man has to call off the elopement, and the doctor takes the woman home to his wife, and the doctor's wife chaperones her all the way home to her family (i.e., the man who currently owns her) and vouches for her virtue, and her reputation is preserved
like: three novels in a row had this exact arc

me
and it's just a FASCINATING response to Clarissa?? because it's not a fantasy of being less vulnerable than Clarissa, right, it's not about having some power she didn't have: it's about... the world just rewarding you for your suffering and endurance?

hbbo
(sorry, I'm suddenly on a call with an exhausting man who happens to be my coworker)

me
(ahahaha, topical! no worries.)
Today at 12:16 AM

hbbo
"I become intimate with it by manipulating it, using it, getting messy and tangled and confused with it": kinky! and delicious. Also sorry for vanishing earlier; it was almost time for me to take off & this dude called me with six complaints, & then I drove home & watched "Rope" with Gins. But yes, I definitely see where you're going here! It's a mode of changing the world surrounding the heroine, rather than changing the heroine to suit the world

me
haha, no worries, you gave me fair warning!
I hope you enjoy your upcoming time off the grid -- that sort of thing is always so refreshing!

DH as fully integrated into argument rather than series of experiments, reparative reading, affect, the body, these aren't questions, there are positions I want to occupy in relation to my subject, and my subject is the 1790s -- which means I find myself asking, "what is lovable in Hannah More?" A useful typo, "what is livable in Hannah More?" -- what can she give us if we come to her not looking for contradictions in her theology or desperate to find progressive "resistance" in her avowed conservativism? If we read with the grain instead of against it, we can chuckle at and move past her patronizing attitude to the poor and contemplate the high standards of sincere virtue and self evaluation she promotes

We want things to be a few, simple, balanced categories — we especially want there to be two equally-matched sides of a binary — but in fact just about everything follows a power-law distribution, which will necessitate a long-tail “misc” category.

### jottings from DHN

*** ask Adam how I can make something come of this shakespeare project with mom

To do this work well, you need to combine archives. But how can you combine archives well and ethically?
Stanford Literary Lab won't share or tell you about their corpus
-- is my dissertation in part about building a database that can bring together disparate sources...?
-- can I get my collaborators to help me with this? can I do it myself??
--- need to have space for multiple "versions" of each text, that can variously combine or separate them (do I have to build this ontology?)
--- want to be able to attach qualitative assesments, join sheets etc... I think I need a relational database

## August 24, 2017

I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history": 

"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."

"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them."

It requires research and study, in order to identify and disentangle the many projects and effects within a work; we must know which parts to discard and which to nurture, to render something useful to ourselves, and we must know what exists for us to repurpose: this is why I study literature. And it requires instruction in order to allow students to get past, e.g., "I thought I was supposed to respect Mrs Bennet" to the literary riches within: this is why I teach literature.

(Literature, unlike history, is permitted artistic license.)

This constant re-translation allows us to continue conferring and experiencing value to the work of previous generations. I don't value the past or tradition simplistically, or for the virtue of merely being older; but we do not always have to reinvent the wheel, and seeing that things **were different** in the past can allow us to remember that they will be different in the future.

(Though I suppose, since I proceed on the assumption that it is not possible to perceive or understand the "now," I do often dismiss the contemporary as insufficiently informative to be getting on with.)

How do I find a more specific research question? Why do I, over time, feel less and less clear about what I am trying to find out???

New guiding principles: Literally every idea I have for “research”, of any kind, goes in this document. One snippet per “thought.” Let it all accumulate into groupings organically.

#### Current status of Shakespeare project:

SO much "ugh" zone built up around this, but I think we're less 'scooped' than I feared...

**Quotation:** I should send mom some specs for what I'd like the data output to look like, based on the great poster I saw at DH2017. But I should also see whether I can research these questions directly using  github.com/lit-mod-vis/middlemarch-critical-histories and http://commonplacecultures.org/

**Networks:** I should ask mom to do all of Shakey's plays and send me the CSV files so I can make graphical networks.
--> ask to implement two different treatments of "asides" and monologues (where audience is and is not node)
I should also start building a corpus of 18thC TEI plays... I might be in better shape than I feared initially.

### DH2017 reflections:

I feel a little frustrated/impatient to see other people farther along with research questions that I am interested in, but am trying to take this as evidence that I am on a good track and they will be interested in my results.

Things I'm doing differently:
* **Quotations**: treat Shakespeare as 18thC canonical author rather than Early Modern; look for use of extract books
* (*Networks**: examining role of the audience in the node; specifically looking at 18thC transitional tragedy (can I spot "firsts"?)
* **1790s popular literature**: encompassing multiple generic forms, esp pamphlets etc; checking the selection biases of ECCO (and HathiTrust?); combining many datasets

Everybody seems to be using HathiTrust these days, but I just don't like their messy data... :/ But, I *am* trying to combine as many datasets as possible, so HathiTrust probably has a role to play?

Had a good chat with Alyssa about what I'm learning about the French revolution... Some thoughts:

> L: the difference between a bunch of drunken idealists vs a bunch of over-caffeinated idealists.... is madame guillotine

> A: they go to declare war, vibrating, sweating a little, eyes darting everywhere
>
> A: “are... are you okay” asks the holy roman empire
>
> A: “IT’S THE REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR” they say, their hair sticking up from all the sweat

> L: it was the summer, they were hot, the haitian revolution had deprived them of all their coffee and sugar, the revolutionaries had nothing left to live for
>
> A: Oh, caffeine withdrawal, that explains it
>
> L: everyone was hangry

> A: Have you considered writing your dissertation on the impact of coffee on the french revolution
>
> L: honestly... I.... could? I am really interested in the impact of bodily experience throughout all this nonsense. it REALLY DOES make more sense when you remember that everyone is hot, and caffeinated, and hangry
>
> L: and, like, that’s the crucial flaw in all their enlightenment philosophy, right
>
> L: they’re rejecting bodily experience as irrelevant
>
> A: Everybody still has a body and that body needs stuff no matter how loudly they say it doesn’t
>
> L: right, yeah, and everyone still has emotions too
>
> L: and if you ignore your body and your feelings, you mis-diagnose yourself -- you are even less rational than your default
>
> L: you hear about an army deserting, and you feel a lot of things, and you decide “RATIONALLY my feelings must mean TRAITORS ARE EVERYWHERE AND WE MUST MURDER THEM”
>
> L: or even, like: you murder a bunch of random people, and you feel bad, and you say to yourself “rationally I DON’T feel bad because I am a PATRIOT” and then you murder MORE people when... maybe... those feelings contained important info? vis-a-vis murder?

David's pre- and post-revolutionary paintings get at this problem very well! His dismissal of, and then embrace of, womanly sentiment.

Everybody is still **using** emotions to make arguments, they're just all trying to pretend otherwise.



## August 1, 2017

**IS** there a reason to pre-emptively focus on sustained prose fiction, when evaluating the literary output of a period?? Or to focus on poetry?? WHY are all the bibliographies of novels???

## July 24, 2017

Conspiracy theories play such a huge role in France! The whole way along everybody always wants it to be a conspiracy -- bread is too expensive because aristocrats are scheming to starve the peasants, France lost its first battle in the war because everyone was conspiring not becuase the war was a bad idea... conspiracies mean you don't have to grapple with inhuman(e) systems or admit when you're wrong, so conspiracies are preferable to the truth. The goal is to make up a better story, and stick with it on pain of death... but this can't actually work. Some things are actually real!

Conspiracy is kinda Robert Miles' idea... but it connects to the painful reality of preposession and tyanny. There's something there, in the fact that tyranny is irrational and ineffective -- tyrants can't admit to reality, can't escape their own preposessions -- Wollstonecraft was onto it, that neither women nor kings can be fully rational as long as no one can speak the truth to them.

## July 22, 2017

How does all my special fields reading relate to my dissertation?? Is it just that I care about Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson now? I don't think I'm necessarily reading the expressive "variety" that I argue characterizes literary production and needs to be coped with.... things are pretty similar. Does knowing more about the French Revolution help me somehow? I do feel like I HAVE A better "feel" for the period, from having read so much more.... I am especially noticing as a major theme the desperate distress over the operation of "preposession" that I wrote about as an undergrgrad -- I think I was onto something there! Should I foreground "preposession" further, and its relationship to the political philosophy of the day? It definitely seems connected to tyranny -- Even in More's history of Mary Woods, evidence and testimony are utterly useless and the vulnerable have no recourse when subjected to tyranny based in prepossession. This seems like a fruitful philosophical thread!

## July 15, 2017

Reading Claudia Johnson's article "'Let Me Make the Novels of a Country': Barbauld's 'The British Novelists'" was an astonishing and inspiring breath of incredibly incisive research, so closely tied to everything I am interested in re: re-examining the canon, and women in the canon, not from the naive position of replacing the canon with a women now, but from a complex and historically-grounded perspective. Her incisive readings of the agendas of, e.g, Watt and Kiely, too, were just excellent. I want to do that! How do I do that?

Workflow thoughts: do I need, like, a big cork board to physically tack ideas to? To go all What Is The Connection? ... I want to be properly grappling with the difficult-but-rewarding critical work (like the Johnson article) more often, and to *produce* things that I can then use, as a result -- I want to build my thoughts into something... how can I do that other than by spending a month in the woods as a hermit?

WHAT IF I USED TOPIC MODELLING TO LOOK AT FRANK'S GOTHIC TYPES? Maybe there is too little text? But finding words that "mean" the same thing as each other seems like.. what topic modelling is for?

## July 4, 2017

My thinking workflow, I think, involves gathering a bunch of bits in a voracious acquisition mode, and then synthesizing everything in a short burst later. So, I will gather paragraph-sized ideas in writing and in visualizations (rough ones) in scrivener, where I can rearrange them and group them thematically, and then when it's time to make a chapter I'll hide in the woods with indesign for a month to pull it together. 

## July 1, 2017

What is my WORKFLOW? Am I dumping thoughts into Scrivener? Into InDesign?? Into a website? Should I have an outline? A bunch of scraps? I can't figure out how to think all at once about all of the bits and pieces I have flying around!!

Final observations/results from topic modelling titles:

Opening Q: What topics are represented in our scholarly, edited corpora of eighteenth century texts? How do those compare to mass print production in the period?

Method: 50 topic models of titles of ESTC works vs ECCO-TCP, both from 1789-99

Results: As perhaps might have been anticipated, the
ECCO corpus emphasizes “timeless” literary and philosophical works, whereas the ESTC corpus is dominated by “timely” advertisements, government bulletins, and ephemera.

![topic modeling results](THE-DISS/figures/R-topic-models/estc-ecco-topic-comparison-notes.png)

Tufte class was great for doing lots of thinking!!

Thoughts about design:
* keep underlying structures simple -- what will be rich and luscious is your **content**
* very successful data presentation in news story just... says numbers, when they are needed. not encoded into charts, corralled into special number boxes -- just stated directly.
* a key is a sign you designed something wrong: label things are directly as possible, especially for colour coding
* information at exact point of need
* your comparison should be: put your design in one window, and google maps into a window next to it. once you're done weeping, ask, "why can't I do this?"
* *total indifference to mode of production* is critical. (oh god, I'm going to lay out my whole diss in indesign, aren't I)
* sparkline graphics integrate image and word, have incredible resolution
* use Gill Sans (or maybe Trebuchet) for graphics -- great density

Six principles of design:
1. show comparisons, contrasts, differences
2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemtic structure (intervention relies on manipulable causality -- can't *do* anything with the information without causality)
3. show multiple variables (3 or more) -- the world is multivariate
4. *completely integrate* words, numbers, maps, graphics, etc, etc
5. documentation must thorouhgly describe evidence and its sources, provide complete measurement scales
6. presentations succeed based on their content. for better presentations, get better content.

Thoughts about my research / dissertation:
* "in studying human behaviour, most 'big data' us repurposed data -- that's not how science works" -- don't repurpose data, collect it, with a focus and for a purpose
* **can** I identify / manipulate cause and effect?
    * I guess my MA question is "does gender cause different kinds of writing"?
* I'm trying to look at **books** -- can I get all the book dots moving around? to show more of my data, more granularly?
    * HOW do I design them?? by hand, in indesign and illustrator???
* My dissertation is to tackled 1789-99. It doesn't matter where my information is FROM, don't do a chapter on ESTC and a chapter on ECCO-TCP, etc!! *See what's there*, and **connect** them in an enormous, rich, multivariate visualization
    * (I will have such a fight with the department over this...)
    * I want to do what Minard did. It would be much harder than writing a lot of words, and much more useful.
* Research Q: *what is the impact of the French Revolution in British literature?* (**lots** of detail to dig into here)
* Research Q: Who is reading what in Britain?
* Tufte **also** thinks 3D is the future... I want to pull the Corvey PDFs into a Unity environment, implement the book properly! I could probably do this myself in a year or two.... **or** I could print out all the books, which would be less share-able but much better for me.
* I need a better data organization process. Maybe, a central location for each little bit, with clear descriptions of what's in there and how it got there? and then a big pile of individual bits of ideas for drafting the diss in... charts-to-self and conclusions-to-self also.
* Research project: systematic meta-analysis of The Literature (and especially what it says about various forms of literary production), in spreadsheet form of coursse

## June 5, 2017

I will be able to do topic modelling on my ECCO-TCP corpus at DHSI!!

"Topics" I'd like to try to find:
- poetry/prose/drama
- Gothic / non-Gothic
- men / women

All of those would be "use some training texts -- see if they're accurate on the main corpus" uses of topic modelling; I should try to find my training texts in advance...

## May 26, 2017

As I read McLeod's dissertation, I am almost overwhelmed by how much work she did and how much she is investigating exactly the kinds of things that interest me -- I keep meaning to look quickly through it for the key points, but I get sucked in.

## May 22, 2017

I have a LOT of ideas about my research questions from talking with Jakob this weekend, and don't want to formally, though I hesitate to "publish" them even this much! I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:

1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."

1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poorly crafted, or designed according to unliterary or unserious standards, or simply popular with the "wrong sorts" of people -- I immediately want to read those texts, to the exclusion of the "good" works which stand in contrast to them.

2, I do believe, sentimentally, in the Power Of Literature, as a tool to shape and improve the self, to foster empathy, to... to be Morally Improving. Particularly in a pedagogical setting, particularly for young readers (particularly for myself as a young, marginalized person).

2A, I don't think it can possibly be the case that **all works of literature** are equally well-adapted to the **use** of literature for self-creation. Some texts take more work than others. Especially, again, in a pedagogical setting, where it is important both to provide historical context and to nurture each student's individual reading of the text. So, maybe... if we want to use literature to expand students' worldviews, inculcate empathy, teach humanistic thinking... some texts... will be Good for that... and others will be Bad.

I think the tension resolves for me, right now, in the conclusion that one must **study** everything, and **teach** only the most useful -- always keeping open a bridge by which a student may go from learner to researcher.

Also -- many times the "bad" texts through Idea 1 above are, really, socially marginalized texts of various kinds, which are highly likely to be "good" through Idea 2. The knowledge that there is more than one kind of Literature (and thus more than one kind of Life) is, in itself, one of the things that I think reading can most powefully provide to readers.

So, I am practically allergic to the mere thought of trying to identify Good and Bad texts -- by my own instincts I will then end up only wishing to spend time on my Bad ones -- but I do feel like there is space here to distinguish between the **multiple** uses of literature. If there are **many** lists of Good Books, does that address the fundamental problem at all???


## May 15, 2017

Can I use some of the stuff I'm doing for Shakespeare for this dissertation?? Maybe the theatrical social network modelling? (How can I tell when two research ideas are part of the same.. idea?)

## May 11, 2017

IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability

Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?

## May 8, 2017

Is the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here? Am I interested in the novel as a form at all? Why is everyone else so interested in the novel to the exclusion of other literary forms???

Am I interested in the poetry, actually? How can I see which generic form dominates the decade?

## April 29, 2017

Picking up my MA research again has really re-energized my desire to work with a range of bibliographies for the decade -- it's a short enough period that I don't actually have to rely on the ESTC, and really I don't want the ESTC to take on too much authority/prominence

Already have: ESTC, Ann Tracy, Frederick Frank. Should add: Garside bib of the novel, Franz Potter's bib of bluebooks. Should find: something for plays! something for poetry! something for pamphlets??!

## April 22, 2017

Info on publishers, answering my earlier questions, from Garside!

"By the 1790s it was not unusual for authors to change publishers, in seeking out advantages, Charlotte Smith switching between Cadell, Robinson, John Bell, and Sampson Low; Ann Radcliffe moving from Thomas Hookham (at the higher end of the circulating library trade) to publish The Mysteries of Udolpho with Robinson and The Italian (1797) with Cadell, the former advertised as comprising ‘four very large volumes’ and both set a premium price. Almost invariably it was such authors who managed to claim larger payments and whose works most regularly entered into subsequent editions." -- p. 401, ‘Ordering’ Novels

<!-- ## April 17, 2017

Just giving myself credit in beeminder for installing G++ as the next step toward compiling the code mom wrote so I can run it myself.-->

## April 13, 2017

Removed all corpora from the repo online (though keeping them in the directory locally) so I can be usefully organized on my computer without publishing data that I only have for my own research.

Also added the code that mom wrote to start simplifying / cleaning up the publisher names in the ESTC data! It looks like it's going to take some dedicated work manually listing the substitutions, but still much better than manually MAKING the substitutions.

It also doesn't seem to **quite** be working yet...? But I'm sure I can figure out what's wrong.

I HAVE confirmed that I know how to 'join' the two spreadsheets of the full ESTC data and the out.csv file that this program produces! And can work with them both in Tableau! And it's going to be SO HELPFUL!!! :D

## April 10, 2017

It’s one of my key priorities to account for the impact over time of works which cannot extend **back** in influence to before they were written, but most certainly do extend **forward** infinitely; no work is confined to a single moment.

Older works will have had more years for people to potentially read them, so that an increase in an author’s popularity also increases the relevance of their older works. A new bestseller like Udolpho supplements The Romance of the Forest, it doesn’t supercede it. Ditto Charlotte Smith’s Elegiac Sonnets.

When my inquiry starts in 1789, there is already an enormous catalogue of works of active interest to readers of the day; it's not a blank slate.

(Am I impressed by longevity?? I think what matters to me here is that this is a way that "normal", "average" books have great impact: they form a context/mediascape that only makes sense as a whole.)

## April 5, 2017

Somehow I've crossed over into "writing my chapter" without realising I had anything to say yet! All that playing around with charts was research, apparently. For the first time, I'm feeling good about having a chapter drafted before the end of the year!

## March 31, 2017

Thinking about how ESTC encourages us to see the decade as a network of publishers -- can a given publisher (e.g. Cadell) be taken to represent a "mainstream" set of perspectives, such that that publisher's shifting decisions about what to publish constitute changes in the "mainstream"? Vs a radical publishers (like whoever took Desmond)?

This would be one way for information about publishers to inflect our understanding of individual works -- provides a way to assess the marginality / centrality of the ideas within the Overton Window.

## March 23, 2017

If I want to write on the networks of 18thC publishers, I should see what work already exists, and see if I can convert those existing scholarly models into visualizations of some kind.

TODO: find existing work on social networks of 18thC publishers

## March 17, 2017

I took some time trying to extract individual publishers from the big "publisher" lists (focusing on T. Cadell) -- it looks like it might be a tricky computational problem (or a *month* of manual sitzfleisch), but if all the publishers could be identified it would enable some *really, really cool* modeling of the publishers' relationships with each other (and the connections between authors via their publishers!). It'd definitely be a journal article for me if we could solve it.

Re: the ESTC's model of the decade -- this info really takes the focus away from authors (no individual one of which can really dominate), and puts it on publishers.

Also, re: Charlotte Smith's publishers -- T. Cadell did indeed refuse to publish Desmond because it was too radical!

## March 13, 2017

### Who did Ann Radcliffe publish with?

Ahhhhhh, this chart shows SO WELL a change from Hookham / Hookham & Carpenter to GG&J!

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers.png?raw=true)

Of course, one could also consider Hookham, Carpenter, and Hookham & Carpenter together:

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

TODO: research whether it makes sense to separate those publishers or merge them!

The chronological shift also tracks by title:

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's publishers by work](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-publishers-titles.png?raw=true)

### Who did Charlotte Smith publish with?

This chart method also makes Charlotte Smith's history even easier to see:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-3.png?raw=true)

### Who did Hannah More publish with?

Mostly, the Cheap Repository tracks. She has so many, I haven't really detangled all of them...

![chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers.png?raw=true)

But, interestingly, when she's writing different kinds of works, she goes to different publishers:

![excerpt of a chart of Hannah More's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

### Who did Mary Robinson publish with?

She stuck much less to one person!

![chart of Mary Robinson's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/robinson-publishers.png?raw=true)

### What works were most reprinted?

Well, first I have each individual author's graphs:

![chart of Hannah More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-2.png?raw=true)

![chart of Ann Radcliffe's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/radcliffe-printings.png?raw=true)

![chart of Mary Robinson's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/robinson-printings.png?raw=true)

![chart of Charlotte Smith's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-printings.png?raw=true)

The ratios / numbers of works by each author are interestingly different, but as the numbers under each title make clear, these charts are not remotely at scale compared to each other!

So here they all are compared:

![chart of four key authors' most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/4-authors-printings.png?raw=true)

That's an awful lot of Hannah More. Let's take her out to better compare the other three:

![chart of three key authors' most reprinted works, minus Hannah More](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/3-authors-printings-noHMore.png?raw=true)

Radcliffe just does not seem all that astonishingly dominant in these views! If she had greater prominence, it must have been through larger print runs, or through greater circulation in circulating libraries.

TODO: track down print run sizes for the works by my four key authors (a big to-do, for sure!)

## March 7, 2017

I think it's introducing needless confusion to be trying to think of things as "chapters" at this stage -- my chapters will need to be shaped by my results!

Instead, to make sure I'm still "writing up as I go", I'll focus on describing each individual experiment and just shove it all into chapter 3 to be organized and subdivided later.

## Feb 27 2017

I made a better version of my Charlotte Smith publisher chart! Much clearer, and also I'm no longer accidentally excluding two of her publishers.

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers-2.png?raw=true)

------

Study a "sample" of the ESTC that looks at the most prolific authors? Or most-reprinted works? (But it's so labor-intensive to see what's a reprint, given the variability in titles)

## Feb 11 2017

What I'm finding extra-fascinating about Hannah More's pamphlets is how different titles seem to be packaging the same work to different audiences. Most obvious is "Dame Andrews: a ballad" and "Dame Andrews: a tale", but there's also "The two wealthy farmers, or, the history of Mr. Bragwell," which is sometimes "The history of Mr. Bragwell; or, the two wealthy farmers." (That one might just be normal. But even then, it's interesting that some fluidity of title is normal...) And of course there's the labeling of some things as "Cheap Repository" or "A Sunday Reading". "On carrying religion into the common business of life" looks like it is part of "The Two Shoemakers" but it's so often presented entirely independently.

I feel like I'm seeing a bit of a pattern, where some things get one printing and essentially fizzle out, and others are significantly more popular.

![squares chart of More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-squares.png?raw=true)

![bar chart of More's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/hannah-more-printings-bars.png?raw=true)

I also looked at Thomas Paine's most printed works, which seemed to be an awful lot of letters. But I form no interesting hypotheses.

![squares chart of Paine's most reprinted works](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/paine-printings-squares.png?raw=true)

## Feb 10 2017

TABLEAU IS JUST STUPIDLY COOL AND I MADE SO MANY CHARTS AND I AM SO EXCITED

So far I have just pulled the ESTC data in -- I fiddled with making it combine with the ECCO-TCP information but haven't figured it out yet. I've already learned SO MUCH about the ESTC records, though!!

So here we have the number of records per year, during my period:

![graphs of works per year](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/master/figures/estc-tableau/works-per-year.png)
 
TODO: I should compare this to, e.g., Garside, to see if it means anything. Not super exciting as-is.

I decided to look at who was publishing most, and it turned out to be the government:

![bar chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-bars.png?raw=true)

(That's after I filtered out the 11,000+ "null" authors.) I was expecting more of a long-tail kind of curve, but there's a huge cliff after the first four! Probably because the first four are the government, and then the fifth is George III the person (also the government but on a more human scale).

A prettier but not really clearer version trying to contextualize the relative prominence of those government publications:

![squares chart of most prolific authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-squares-radcliffe.png?raw=true)

and THEN it was DELIGHTFULLY EASY to filter out everybody whose name began with "Great Britain", resulting in the following:

![bar chart of most prolific authors not named Great Britain](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/most-prolific-not-GB.png?raw=true)

This has much more of the curve I expected. I am still BLOWN AWAY by how TOTALLY UNKNOWN half these names are to me. I had to fight for Hannah More and Oliver Goldsmith on my special fields list! I have never even HEARD of John Wesley!! Who IS he, to be outselling Shakespeare??

...He was one of the founders of Methodism!!! FASCINATING. That puts Thomas Paine up there with two religious writers, nestled between them and the government. And then Shakespeare. WACKY.

I also decided to take a peek at where things are usually published:

![squares chart of publication location](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/place-of-publication.png?raw=true)

They are published in London.

From there I decided to try some much more specific question. First, I looked at the authors associated with any publisher with Minerva in the name (aiming to capture the Minerva Press):

![squares chart of Minerva authors](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/minerva-authors.png?raw=true)

It was reassuring to *finally* have something with a sensible name at the top of the list: the literary canon is certainly not selecting its 1790s representatives based on popularity, but the academic gossip about the Minerva press has pegged its targets pretty well.

TODO: Is the number of "null" (unsigned) authors associated with the Minerva Press proportionate to the overall number of "null" authors?

I also looked a bit at who Charlotte Smith was publishing with. It took some fiddling to group together entries which were for the same publisher with marginally different spelling or formatting, but it seems that she has a strong allegiance to T. Cadell but occasionally dabbles with others:

![chart of Charlotte Smith's publishers](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-tableau/charlotte-smith-publishers.png?raw=true)

That "2" with G.G.J. is the first printing of Desmond. Why did she publish Desmond with a new publisher, when she had such a longstanding relationship with Cadell? (Cadell's 1789 works include a reprint of her much earlier Elegaic Sonnets, which suggests a long/committed relationship.) J. Bell got The Old Manor House (2 printings) and then The Wanderings of Warwick. Sampson Low got Montalbert, Marchmont, and A Narrative of the Loss of Charlotte. Was she shopping around trying to find homes for her more Gothic material? T Cadell's address is on the Strand -- was he too posh for her sensational tales?

Most of T Cadell's printings are reprints of Elegaic Sonnets or Rural Walks (I should probably read Rural Walks for special fields), but he also printed Emmeline, Ethelinde, and Celestina, so he can't have been *too* opposed to her novels.

## Jan 30 2017

One approach to the ESTC corpus might be to randomly sample 500 items, carefully classify them, and then use those classifications as training to computationally classify the larger list? Maybe with topic modelling?? But everything might be on FAR too tiny a scale for this to be reliable; ask mom. (It would, at least, be possible to *test* my accuracy afterward, by randomly checking a sample of the machine-classified titles to see if I concur..)

Before I get too carried away, I have to figure out what on earth I'm doing with the dates. It seems like many of the texts might not really be from my decade at all, which matters!

## Jan 28 2017

I looked at the ESTC corpus for my newsletter, and should duplicate those thoughts here:

"I have bibliographic metadata on 51,965 works printed in England between 1789-99!! SO EXCITING!!! :D (Thanks, English Short Title Catalogue!) To start, I figured I'd hit it with some extremely blunt tools, and just shoved the big list of the titles of those works into Voyant. Look! A word cloud!

![word cloud of titles of works in ESTC corpus](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud.png?raw=true)

Word clouds are... not very useful. But they're also not very hard! So for a newsletter, why not?

What have I learned? Well, mostly what all 51,965 works have in common is an interest in telling me where they came from and what is in them:

![two copies of word cloud of ESTC titles, each with some words circled](https://github.com/lawrenceevalyn/THE-DISS/blob/master/figures/estc-voyant/everything-cloud-annotated.png?raw=true)

By whom were these works "preached", "performed", "translated", "written", "published", and "sold"? That varies, but they sure were all those things! What, exactly, might these "volumes", "books", "book[s]", "letters", "letter[s]", "collection[s]", "edition[s]", "appendi[ces]", "sermon[s]", "account[s]", and "observations" all be "containing"? Dunno, but they've "added" something "new" so you should probably buy this particular one!

This word cloud mostly reinforces, then, my sense that the title of an 18thC work was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in contextualizing and advertising the work to its potential readers.

Here are three works listed right next to each other, published in 1791, for example:

* A funeral sermon : preached at Spa-Fields chapel, July 3, 1791. on the death of the Late Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, By the Rev. David Jones, Of Langan
* The romance of the forest : interspersed with some pieces of poetry. By the authoress of 'A Sicilian romance,' &c. In three volumes
* A series of letters to the Right Honorable Edmund Burke, upon the impeachment of Mr. Hastings : The third edition, with many corrections and additions, a new preface, and appendix. By George Hardinge, Esq. M.P

There's a lot of information packed into these titles! Later on I think all of this detail will be very helpful in teasing apart publication trends despite only having limited bibliographical detail, but the unprocessed full corpus is kind of more than Voyant can shed meaningful light on."

## Jan 21 2017

Time to freewrite about how my work relates to the critical context!

I am most persuaded that my work has something to offer to the very recent conversation around "surface reading," and other ways of escaping paranoid critique. I think the theoretical principles of modeling, prototyping, and iteration, allow for richness and surprise. cf Heather Love, Sharon Marcus, Stephen Best, Cannon Schmitt, and a bit of Eve Sedgwick (also possibly Rita Felski?)

I feel confident that, even if right now my ideas are undeveloped, by the time my project finished I will have produced something of technological/methodological interest to other DH researchers. I think Steven Zwicker's idea of random sampling will bear some fruit for me, and I'd like to model some actually-useful topic modelling with my full text corpora.  Oh! And I think it will be valuable to have a sense of how "representative" the ECCO-TCP corpus is.

What I don't have, right now, is a compelling 18thC question. And my trip to the AGO yesterday really drove home the importance of having one clear, straightforward, hard question which will drive all the tools being used (instead of letting the tools drive inquiry).

How can I narrow down to just one question? How can I know that the question is important? How can I use special fields to make sure that I have chosen the right question?

Why I care about the 18thC: because there's **so much** and it operates on such a different value system. It's always surprising. It's always complicated. And I guess the question I care about is, how can we teach students about the past in a way that makes them understand how complicated humans and history are, makes them more empathetic and thoughtful.

I'm thinking now of Wollstonecraft's Vindication: one could excerpt just her descriptions of the legal status of women, and discuss whether her critiques are accurate and her proposed reforms were reasonable. And then one could excerpt her discussions of class and social hierarchy and ask, what about these?

(But I want to leave room for people in the past to not all perfectly align with my own value system -- I grow more and more convinced of Radcliffe and Austen as socially conservative in many ways)

One of the ideas that was mentioned but not developed at MLA was that, if one wishes to teach principles of justice, if one wishes to turn students' personal distress into pro-social empathy, one must **choose to teach different texts**. So I guess my question is: which eighteenth century texts should we teach? And how?

**Can** that be my question??

---

Egads. The probable outline of the diss right now is:

1. Intro
1. ESTC corpus
1. ECCO-TCP full texts
1. Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson
1. Conclusion

...and Chapter 4 there is basically an entire dissertation. But I don't want to cut any of those authors!! aaagh

## Jan 20 2017

Frustratingly, the ECCO-TCP metadata csv that I have doesn't include publication dates, but according to [this query](http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/philologic4/eccotcp/query?report=bibliography&method=proxy&year=1789-1799&results_per_page=1000&start=0&end=0) at ARTFL‘s PhiloLogic search engine, 502 of the ECCO-TCP texts are from my years 1789-99! That's a pretty respectable corpus! Within the parameters of what I can investigate/classify manually (if only just).

## Jan 16 2017

Time to freewrite about what the hell I am doing here, exactly!

I want to find a way to account for the real *variety* of the period: there is no “average” or “normal” text against which the “exceptional” works can contrast, nor can any text be “representative.” But we still, on a practical level, need to carry on. And surely it is possible to triage.

What is the goal of the field? To triage texts based on their “importance” for students to learn? To triage texts based on the social, emotional, intellectual rewards they provide their readers? Both, obviously, but: how to do either?

(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of *all* literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone *else’s* job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong. So it must be the ways of reading, not the things read, which it is our responsibility to suss out...)

(Can reading from a distance be empathetic? or moral? or reparative?)

What do I want to *find*? What would be an exciting "result"? I'd love to find some better "representative" body of texts, somehow.

The idea of *carrying on*, somehow, despite imperfection and incompleteness: this is what I want to kidnap from other fields. The ability to say, fine, this thing is complicated, so I will begin with a *stupid* model, and then I will look at my stupid model and say, "aha! it is stupid!", and then I will make it incrementally less stupid according to what I learn.

Modelling, and prototyping, as scholarly practices that can help us find the way forward: am I doing this?

I am trying to model the decade 1789-99. I will probably produce several models via iterative prototypes. One of my models will be a "traditional" close-reading based one. Another will be the ESTC catalogue. A third would balance these out nicely! Something with ECCO-TCP full texts, perhaps?

-- the trouble with this is that, although iteration is critical to inquiry, it's only polite to spare one's readers the long journey; I'll want to skip right to my latest, most-developed model.

Why are there people other than Ann Radcliffe in here? -- because I need to model the whole decade in order to contextualize her place within it?

What is Radcliffe's relationship to the "school of Radcliffe"? Does she respond to her school? Who else had schools? If nobody else had schools: that's a BIG DEAL. Why identify a "school"? I take it for granted that the individual members of her school are all, in their own ways, responding to / rewriting her materials according to their own idiosyncratic agendas.

Should my title be something more like "Modelling the mediascape in England, 1789-99"?

What percentage of books promise in their titles some kind of secret or mystery to be discovered? This is the kind of question that would be more interesting if two different time periods were being compared...

## Jan 13 2017

MLA was a whirlwind! I was surprised to find myself describing an interest in religious and sentimental literature [ETA: **didactic** literature!], singing the praises of Hannah More -- it does reinforce my desire not to treat genres too separately.

I most enjoyed a panel on "anti-marriage plots"-- it made me want to look at what narratologists are up to and how I might dip my toe into that field.

Reading Wolfenbach, Emmeline, Coelebs, and now Clermont, I have been impressed again and again by the importance of, hm, women's duplicity? The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness. I want to read more about the sentimental novel: it seems like there is a really direct line from there to Radcliffe.

I also want to look back at my MA work a bit more to see if I better understand my own arguments there, now that I have done more actual reading.

It does sometimes feel like I will have no idea what I'm talking about until I've read a hundred 18thC novels... I should make a list of what I've actually rolled my eyes past, and think about some habits of, e.g., using ReadMe! to speed-read more of these. I find that I get a lot out of even a very superficial read of the works as a whole.

## Jan 2 2017

It's been hard to know where to start with this, hard to have a specific enough question that I can be excited about it. I know I want to research and publish individual chapters somewhat separately but I can't do them all at once!

The FIRST chapter I will work on is my 'background' description of what constitutes "normal" during my decade. I'll do this research and turn it into a paper and into my chapter 2.

I’m going to focus on building my database of bibliographic data for all prose, drama, and poetry published in London during the years 1789-99. I’m in talks with a library to get copies of the relevant 52,001 items from their database; I’ll see how many different things I can pile up, and mess with them, and write a description of the literary mediascape in my decade. It’ll be fun!!

I'll definitely want to do this no matter how my other literary questions shake out, so even though it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing (Ann Radcliffe? Charlotte Smith? Hannah More??), I do know how to do this part.

## Dec 23 2016

A question that's very important and interesting to ME, though maybe not to anyone else (???) is, how 'representative' is the ECCO-TCP corpus compared to the ETSC catalog?

(How many of the 2,188 ECCO-TCP texts are even from 1789-99?)

## Dec 20 2016

Trying to come up with a special fields list is increasingly paradoxical: the goal of my research is to assess our methods of selecting "representative" authors, and step one is to... select representative authors. Even focusing on 'touchstones of the canon' leaves me with FAR too much to read.

Also far too much: an eight-chapter dissertation. Maybe I'm looking at too many case studies. Could I just do the 'school of Radcliffe' and the 'school of Charlotte Smith'? Based on the network graph from DHSI last year?

## Dec 10 2016

In correspondence with ETSC, looks like I will be able to have access!

Made a first rough draft of special fields reading list. Currently looking at Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Hannah More as my case study authors (plus Radcliffe of course). Unsure about cutting Elizabeth Inchbald and Joanna Baillie... I'd really like to do some experiments and get basic popularity/prevalence numbers before picking case studies. I don't know anything yet! I don't know how to pick anything!! That's why I need corpus analysis! So-- I will read anybody who seems fun and interesting in their own right for as a strong *candidate* for a case study, since I need to do my special fields reading list before the first experiment, but I'm not committing.

Currently thinking a good structure might be:

1. Introduction

1. Chapter 1: data analysis of all of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 2: closer analysis of a randomly-selected subset of my ETSC corpus

1. Chapter 3: case study 1 - Charlotte Smith

1. Chapter 4: case study 2 - Mary Robinson

1. Chapter 5: case study 3 - Hannah More

1. Chapter 6: Ann Radcliffe time, synthesis

1. Conclusions

Is that too many chapters? That's probably too many chapters.

## Nov 30 2016

The English Short Title Catalogue says there are 51996 titles published in England 1789-1799!! That's a lot. Also, it will only give me information on the first 1001 results?

I'd love to compare against the Richardson/Fielding era but I feel like five years is too short to capture the period I'm interested in (surely I should do all of Radcliffe's ouvre?) and ten years is clearly an ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM.

Reading Moretti's *Distant Reading*:
* Look up Literary Lab pamphlet 1, "Quantitative Formalism"
* He promised studies of Austen's rivals, and then never did them: can I do it?
* Can I copy his methods of looking for clues in Doyle's competitors to see Radcliffe's success? Does a similar pattern follow for the explained supernatural?
* I, too, am interested in "*rivals*: contemporaries who write more or less like canonical authors... but not quite, and who... seem to be the largest contingent of the 'great unread'" (67)
* This book charts Moretti's working-out of the (conflicting?) theories of evolutionary selection and centre-periphery systems, as explanations for literary history. I also care centrally about these questions! They are my driving questions!
* What it means for readers to 'like' something: "literary genres are problem-solving devices, which address a contradiction of their environment, offering an imaginary resolution by means of their formal organization. The pleasure provided by that formal organization is therefore more than just pleasure -- it is the vehicle through which a larger symbolic sentiment is shaped and assimilated." (141)
* "I set out to explain the logic behind literary survival and oblivion" (145)
* The essay "Style, Inc.: Reflections on 7,000 Titles" is VERY EXCITING to me; and I might be one of the only readers who begins this essay already having read the bibliography in question cover-to-cover!

## Oct 22 2016
Reading so many articles. Nothing feels clear or connected. What am I *doing*?

## Oct 21 2016
### Reading Keymer's "Shakespeare in the Novel":
* If I do the shakey route I probably need to start much earlier than 1750 -- I probably need to go 1740, to capture the start of Garrick and to capture Richardson
* I might need to go all the way back to Edward Bysshe's *Art of English Poetry* (1702)??
* Honestly, it would be FASCINATING to track the use of Bysshe's book!
* Keymer suggests that I will end up seeing a lot from the anthologies *The Beauties
of Shakespeare* and *The Morality of Shakespeare’s Drama Illustrated*
* Keymer's article overall traces Shakespearean allusions from proofs of literary seriousness to trite convention from 1700 to 1750.

## Oct 19 2016
What traits would a "solution" to the canon problem have?
- it would account for 'the great unread'
- it would enable us to select a readable number of texts based on an explicit metric (most average, most popular at the time, most recognized by subsequent authors as important)

## Oct 10 2016
I have a real problem of scope. The monographs I admire (Price, Clery) cover very broad spans of time, but I'm currently planning to have an extremely narrow slice of 20-30 years in order to allow a density of context. It sounds on its face obviously unfeasible to study "everything, 1750-1830" but... the whole promise of DH is that sort of opening-up of scale.

Will the methods and questions I develop for "everything, 1790-1810" be generalizable to a larger scale? Or (as seems obviously true when I word it like this), will considering literary history on the scale of a century demand a different focus?

## Oct 8 2016
thesis options:
- the uses of shakespeare
- writers who write across the mediascape (pick 3-5)
- microgenres (adventures of a pin, memoir vs life vs history)
